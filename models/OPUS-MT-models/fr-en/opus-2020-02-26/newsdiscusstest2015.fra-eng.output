The survivors of UKIP who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the UK for health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use specious arguments, then discredit them with barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind chronic hypocondria intolerants who think they're all due.
I think you're the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing lunatics, hardly exists.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quotation from a towel does not constitute evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don't know anything about my personal situation or identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence was very surprising, but only because we rarely talk about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to get over it.
I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I guess you don't like it when the media talks about what you don't like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his crazy followers of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is also rotten in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have fixed anything.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ''TIGRE OF EUROPE''' we were boasted a few years ago.
We've known the rest!
It's a good idea to read the article.
We are trying to make it seem that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ''NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE'' is happening.
With the agreement of Brussels, taxes on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not enough ''pavoise'' for the moment with the coming of the Poles.
In the 1980s, in the 20th century, irritation was one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the portugal By considering a constant period, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Greek was in front.
That their development has not been a long, quiet river, it is sure in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full price.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, exactly as before the crisis of 2008.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily traffic jams since the beginning of the year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a clash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon be buying a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once they've been flushed.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair charge passengers a surcharge for the additional fear that they were kindly provided with?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to their heart.
Any article about Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair to those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic rate have only to attack themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair is not going to be happy with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether the passengers will have to be compensated and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error of the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were placed on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a nice trip
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crawls with people.
People do not come in bulk for the quality of restaurants (most of them) or for the Salon de la revue Ã  l'Espace des Blancs-Coteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With many foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, full of people with 50% tourists.
@aloes False!
The only argument that would seem to me to be admissible is that of areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is balanced by the fact that they buy on a tax-free basis.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allow to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, with exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the minister responsible for the economy nor the minister responsible for foreign affairs have the slightest competence to reform the labour code.
As they shut her up.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and companies who want to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.

What if her daughter's estate was, against her will, to use to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some aren't terrible.
Probably his estate would like his share of the cake, if you pass the phrase.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole, and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss an "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting against fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the helm and no other.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to raise the money from the inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, since infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the true French evil: distrust of dialogue
Back to Princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either we come together to help him, or he has a right in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the lessor who lives on the income of his property.
There is a need to differentiate between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live on an annuity.
A property for rent or two for a couple above, it's vice
The little genius of Finance has a singular lack of imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline emerges in response to a recession which is only a wild and therefore brutal decline
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, motorways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is overwhelming: isolation, renovation of the rail network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high incomes and annuitants.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's profits are undermined by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
AppleTM's mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have a number of dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I like the design.
Some people don't value design, for them options, functionality and price take precedence.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there "a better car manufacturer", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and should be encouraged.
That is in our common interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course, of Parisian bobos) could tell us of which author(s) they fight ideas about gender and indicate to us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart and educated person.
I said that about Judith in Furusato's vein evoking Holopherne, a rapprochement that hadn't come to me (I don't have his vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you're referring to it, I'm not interested in this subject, and honestly I don't see what the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that , culturally , send Judith back to Holopherne , it does.
Who's afraid is wondering the World?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first invoking the Bible Judith , the second in calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat slicer.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate of them.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the need for theology?
@: With regard to an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
To claim to fight ideas from the mere presentation made by their detractors ( Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Genre or X Lacroix , theologian ) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.
But, as I explained to our mpfrontist friend, it's the whole difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "Second sex" (it was more of my time) which is I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I was watching the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed up briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really fill the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey make the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it back its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the week with the meteor rain of the Persians and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only goal is to keep the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are improving greatly across the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn't see the eclipse because of the clouds over Melbourne's suburbs.
I'm gonna put a TAX on this eclipse.
ANYONE watching this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he (forcely) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed.
Beautiful picture of the moon over Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be formed.
See today, Tuesday, October 15th, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim for compensation in the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of the Economy tells us that these claims are unfounded.
What if the Ministry of Economy errs?
Will the decision-makers who have earned the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in its time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
@lol No, the state is not comparable to households in terms of managing its budget because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is bounded by the lifetime of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered unproductive, it contributes to the financing of material and intangible investments that will lead to the growth of tomorrow and thus to future revenue.
Some elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember Hippocrates' sacred oath: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical procedures, safe shoot rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these questions politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since Liberals want our health care system to look like the one in the United States, you should know how it works.
Everywhere in the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the doctor, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to business profits and "research".
Read the few reports on our pharmaceutical benefits scheme spending and on the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs found everywhere, as well as the differences between countries in what is on the over-the-counter or only on prescription.
It reinforces itself as a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrict them and the necessary expensive permits.
Although manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of someone in charge of this hospital.
We can't DETAIN patents on the grass...
If "researchers" in the social sciences did research instead of doing policy and networking, one could use their "work."
One researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
To compare is not to look.
To compare it is to do pedagogy not research.
We can't say "the research is completed we have to apply it" and then in a single jet "we have to experiment at everything."
If your research is complete why experiment?
If your research isn't complete, why do you ask for it to be applied?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn on condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they didn't know how to learn?
The pisa tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to keep sophists and ideologues away from training and practitioners teach practitioners.
manufacture reread the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device which leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and which does not allow to advance the system".
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP responsible for the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright, I just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = theft.
It is the same since they must quote their sources correctly.
Often getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without having the right license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can still argue about pedigree assumptions - but it's stealing.
And you can repeat it as much as you like, but it won't become true.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating copyright
Obviously you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions that they have passed by a click.
Maybe if they share their mp3 headphones with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah if we could export this resource we're full of, the grudge that says everything's going wrong....
If it's a PS MP who says so, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy has created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
@gus I've always worked in a private company.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent entrepreneurs: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm a wage earner because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the bad bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
@gus, if we compare with German companies that French entrepreneurs constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have been able to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small - What are French employers waiting for to do the same??
That the state hold hands with them?
That state they're accusing of imperiety?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business couplet from you!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is faced with an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who shun and sluggish while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What's ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
From what I see where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep afloat rather than transform.
That doesn't mean Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of them.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that, alas.
I tried to get them recently, but I didn't make it.
Well, the Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it...
It's an international subsidiary.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticisms when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision would finally be overturned.
And it's better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's operating contract for eight years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that workers must all help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps this is because Dutch management is on good track, whereas British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
Oh, God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "fighting" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "fighting" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "fighting", who are nonetheless dead, I know of palancÃ©es.
To get out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Let's do it again, too.
I'm not telling you it's the condition for you to be in bed, I'm telling you it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When at the example of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that one can have merit to get out of a disease or that one can demerit not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid morale probably makes it easier to accept heavy treatments and prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who fights in medicine, it's first and foremost someone who trusts medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "Lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you get robbed to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, dirt, fat ones, and if I "wrestled" as these psychologists say, it totally escaped me.

I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "rapidly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist who has become a nationalist who has unleashed three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left out: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the LEAST Rule of International Law?
Which country did Serbia attack?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was immediately recognized by the Western states that then lied from end to end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for failing to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn't like him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of prediction of earthquakes works about, by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This kind of study is certainly useful and thanks for sharing the results.
Hope, therefore, but caution is necessary This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those that involve animals that feel a threat coming.
Thank you Science pastor to delight us, often, with these experimental feats that are made in the world.
How would animals know (In advance)?
No doubt by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
An a priori odorless gas for man but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments available to him.
But we don't have a reliable result on these leads...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an arte report telling of the battle of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to make recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular to their modification before seism.
So of course I'm not scientific but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this lead?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we examine things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious magazine, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we come across the same bias: everyone will remember that five minutes before an earthquake the redfish turned bizarrely in circles.
I don't understand that we might think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected as mayor and he didn't keep one.
It just highlights how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and the rest of the country will vote for him.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, Tories' popularity rating will break the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they said about the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than he did.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have truly and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read some books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "strait of scrap metal" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who stayed there.
We understand that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, the Australia, must always be there from the background since the Battle of Savo) do not want to go back.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission is coming to an end.
It's the little ones.

Good evening I think the red hat that has protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Brittany Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not spend a penny of our taxes on financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at the Juventus and now at the FenerbahÃ§e, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team.
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfielder or before in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the big team of Velez who, under the supervision of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes like Vahid Halilhodzic and ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he would become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
Now I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a full-time student.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should like Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to the neighbouring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" by seeing two towers collapse knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How ???
What bothers me a little in this "witness" is that the mere fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice at the horrific death of thousands of people, bears witness in my eyes to a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the greatest caution.
No doubt that in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically harm the great wicked Satan in his very heart.
To do powerful qqch.
Great.
It appears that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims gnawed by their feelings of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt about that.
The Western "Christian/White/Gaulian" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The former splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How can we get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: the bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascising nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we have understood it before, must not push Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long, dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the summer green when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a weekend.
We've had a nice summer this year, don't make your grinchy clichÃ©s!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to the germs from outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a febrileness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snowing and many other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
These are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child supplements , the amount received by the State is mainly derived from deciles 8 to 10.
But for the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure , it is mainly deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) according to Chart 2 .
The elimination of the half share of widows in particular is not at all dealt with in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to be fixed.
Well, we're not on the straw of course, but thinkers.
For once the PS makes a policy rather left-wing we're not gonna cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Let's continue this way and you'll encourage these 20% less work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and OIC recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is always the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to collect as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the utility of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say, to do the misfortune of the greatest number.
We're one of the richest 20%.
Probably also 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so let's give up and live on social minima, especially if we have social housing.
The utopias of red Khmer head cutters have fortunately lived.
I did two AirBnB in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, put it behind you and go back.
From now on it will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky" No, it's not true.
You just really ran out of luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
In his discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent at once, but I'm a little afraid to send Â£1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
"Supporting the troops," sang the Bu$herie in every tone...
It's harmless weapons, then.
I am sure that it will please the families and relatives of thousands of Kurdish people who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically changed by the author, your comment is unproper (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that the chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think this is the time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: This is ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if they were "to" work 35 hours instead of 17.
In time, our teachers are currently earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it can't be seen since National Education can't afford to provide a college/lycÃ©e office to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework in short, except that the employer does not pay the computer, the internet connection, or the supplies.
Besides, it's so much the hideout at 5 pm a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill CAPES with math, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean, you don't want to get in the way of poorly educated bastards whose parents spit on you by calling you a jerk?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the Kurdish population can flourish better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has done absolutely everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which you needed a degree.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid an extra Â£5,000 a year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that either pays well or you like to do.
If I had stayed at the graduate jobs, I'd still have to pay for my student loan.
I don't really like working in companies, so I hope to eventually move either into the public service or in the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article really comes late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011 there was already a three-year backlog.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the bisounour fields as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political science, that is to say what is called the diplomas of unemployed.
I've got one of those diplomas and I've finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the above article says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower but the steps were rapidly raised because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate of engineering studies / artistic fields have lasted for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, to get to work on time and to interact with people in order to achieve results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bisouncous channels?
This is ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about media study degrees or whatever the abscons field you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real subjects.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn't it be better for a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and energize the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the bottom of Essonne and the Val-d'Oise driving 80km back and forth every day by bike to work in Paris.
The inhabitants of the inner wall and the small belt already have many more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RMs.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
You might as well benefit from their great experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for a single bike hanger.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand DelanoÃ«....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we discuss with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they don't pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1/ it's very dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that drive super fast and don't care about the survival of the bikes 2/ we get full of pollution in the head For me the bike paths are worse go, we have to reduce the traffic (urban weight type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), enforce the code of the road by verbalizing systematically (even the bikes at the bottom before we have to adapt the code of the road written for cars 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer zones after the passages nailed, not before otherwise cars and scooters do not get involved.
Cycle paths are apartheid, you have to live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Anything on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% of velo trips is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Indeed, according to OR, the EELV assistants seem sceptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who is really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: It's not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is changing.
That sounds horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was actually filed.
In addition, they should file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect that these cases will be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, it is the responsibility of the air safety authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident foreseeable?
Other planes had been shot down earlier, Ukraine was launching air attacks on the rebels in the area, and of course any aircraft could be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with innocent lives for airlines to pay overflight fees?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurpative government / Western Ukraine's ultra-nationalists - and want to show basically that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous one: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the supply of arms by the CIA to the Contras rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia will let this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-backed rebels.
I hope he can present evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far the investigators have not said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such a beotian in eco, it's grieving!
Calling itself Polar is losing the north is rejoicing.
Only one question from Beotian: Is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who most vehemently criticize Piketty's book have not read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labour, ownership of capital, merit and legacy in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it is the 2 world wars that reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this paving stone knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has a few limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, we can debate it without having read the book, which is essentially a one-way argument in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his cobblestone summarized by the press false?
I haven't read and won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one which seems to me pure fumistry.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has not humanity, on the whole, become richer?
And this addition to population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the prize.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
I wish Malala every happiness, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the working-class neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she was not where she is now, she would have been married at 14.
Is Malala herself not one of those "colored perverts"?
You should have no "airtime" on this site.
You're a horrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when he was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and promotes equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive a higher education and to have the right to decide her marriage herself.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often had to marry at the age of 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at 14 years of age.
Rather disappointed by this entry in season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a bit of difficulty finding her character like Marlene Dietrich.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most accomplished!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing Bowie's anachronistic Life on Mars is simply upsetting.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I'd rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is certain, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it was especially the risks of staging and editing that struck me.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the asepticization of today's productions.
I don't want to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series apart from the technical qualities.
And well, I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too dispersed despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them do 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours or so.
But everyone does what wants, huh?
It is by what I say "I won't look again" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to her.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut government spending instead.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to saber in spending failed.
Controversy over relatively small items of expenditure, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of orientation that voters seem to call their wishes, and all this time some people in each side are pretending that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see their game clearly and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
"Debt" is an asset held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I wouldn't see any problem in getting the government to own a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to use it wisely.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not quite honest on how to reduce taxes, but if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you come up with a figure that makes the tax on Labour and Lib-Dem on the most luxurious residences look ridiculous.
Your first Â£10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns Â£35,000 a year will pay about Â£5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with Â£50,000 would pay around Â£10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with Â£200,000 pays about Â£70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social security contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car sticker, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected at source before the local taxes and the car sticker.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from heaven, or that it's not important to know where billions of pounds of tax go.
How can an unemployed person looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not look, which means 80% are looking for and not finding.
Being unemployed myself, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 resumes, that increases my chances.
Indeed I haven't heard from PÃ´le Emploi in months, does that mean that the agents are more busy with control operations than actually bringing in job advertisements?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then we must do without Pole Emploi.
How is this a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed fulfil their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks for their transport title from the users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed worth remembering that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I had to deal with PÃ´le Emploi, my rights to ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight firmly.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
Checking and checking is now taking precedence, while statutory Employment is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Policies and French non-employees grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance contributes to the valorisation of paid work.
More than waiting for assassin tweets in Arabic...
In reality we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hadj in Mecca this year from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reports that 7,400 people have been denied visas because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox in Mecca during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from flying to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people...
Those countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be placed under strict quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not drastic measures.
Last week alone, people were infected after having had contact with people in West Africa, although they took "all the necessary precautions."
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let's ban them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be quarantined immediately.
That he manages to convey the message of the first individual and the second (including religious) group and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to build in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from this conception there.
It has only been 20 years since information appeared as the prime given to humanity, while religion, the result of the cerebellum, has been leading our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What is the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any case set foot in the Church, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, to remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe that will make it possible to reach more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you see it existed in Christ.
Hillel a century before said to him: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is just a comment: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "progressing justice, peace, fraternity" but without god?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
Next step is to remove the incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain this hero who has changed moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It doesn't make up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth Â£30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at Â£30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at Â£30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department's flip-flops block all the cool sites.
Hello, is that Â£30 then 20% discount, or does Â£30 include 20% discount?
Note however: the PC version is only for DX11.
It caught me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Plus, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon Â£30 for PC, Â£35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, Â£44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll erase it from your library if they decide to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the area.
Join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was the 1940 France a "Putrid Land"?
Say, this Nobel Prize sounds like a poisoned gift to me.
We must love France of 40, that of "the strange defeat"?
When we see who gets the Nobel Prize in literature we wonder if Proust or Dostoevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, who is already hard to read in French and who describes such a limited and egocentric universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection to literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll appreciate Mr.
Modiano's worth if they don't already know him!
For your part, continue to associate with LÃ©vy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, you dreadful people.
Since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing's been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was borderelic.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favourites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just fantasies of CAMRA (not to be confused with the fanatics of the camera).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a buddy's grandfather's to play Nine Card Brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope if I turn 95 I'll be as lively as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read Buddha a little and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, I don't want to upset you, but I think you're moving away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids the quests for the djihadists at the exit of the mosques.
It reports arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental counter-sense: all the representative authorities, organisations or associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned the IS and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who says no word consent.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, there is doubt for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the French Jews' approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and to demand that they publicly demonstrate to the rest of French society that they are wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the negation of the republic and can only help to offend French society.
If there's no doubt, let's just say it.
Who says no word consents, but consents to what?
Consent to proximity to AR or to the conviction of AR.
Silence is practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to keep the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "reveal" the parties represented in Westminster during the elections because there was a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't care about Scotland because they don't sit there.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a long-term good thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's gonna shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their head in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are holding their leader accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that is rather the important thing.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Getting the pumps up by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish Members are unable to vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists and it worked well for him.
However, he is still running for Prime Minister in 2015 and has won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each player to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is "The life of others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of the FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's gay like a world.
Strongly stimulate.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have the reading of hacked files, books in the public domain or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a bug.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's no regrets.
I am outraged by the widespread abdication of users in the face of widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your general public bookseller, you will always notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**tre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example, " Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce.
@Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all literature in the same bin.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile...
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that do not allow readers to be identified or authors to be identified.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic kids under acid.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some of Erdogan's supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey does not want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it gains something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it's actually shooting herself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear from the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals or whether it merely advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is strongly recommended to anyone who pays attention to details rather than to the c*neries swinged by the traditional media. The short article you link with is important and should be read bearing in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings from Iran proposed from Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderates" who seriously fight the horrific secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy pushes the world to the abyss and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existent "moderates" pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"It's even worse if you take Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account."Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I have one in mind.
We would need a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we "should"?
Do you realize that neither criminals nor victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Aren't criminals just old now, like 120 years old?
A little late for that, right?
Particularly concerning the CUP triumvirat which planned and led the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War by revenge by Armenians, and Enver killed by Bolsheviks in an impoverished place of Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding there a Turkish empire.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but other than that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
All clichÃ©s without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Steady straight couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame to name them as future psychological unbalanced.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay for this lady's retirement (?)
GPA is probably a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine in our world.
She's not from today.
Many women carried and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, so we are done...
The important thing in this area is that this practice is framed so that the "commodification" of the body is limited.
But aren't cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, as well as the merchandising of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit ...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good person grow into a distant country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to assume his responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another centuries near home without shouting it at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were also not done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the '70s in the Midlands I only saw it from afar.
I had to go there all day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like it and listen to music - this music today it always affects you as much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there's an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England culture.
No wonder Paul Mason has understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, if you're in the London area in November, 99psoul will pass soul vinyl again, including full Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15th at the Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story," but here's a little article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to have escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan de Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
By drinking pills.
Whatever the train station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahu is not looking for peace because he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (and that was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their constituents have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and entered into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative got up angry and said, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren't even there at the time!".
The Palestinian representative (UN) expressed and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard ...
That it displeases the anti-Israeli is obvious, that is not the purpose sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical relationship ...
And it has always been so since the Politics was globalized ...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What balance of power allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestine conflict is still a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, it's not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
A lot of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist penthouses written by no other.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes her, which means it's a question of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling some truths, maybe truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horripile some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross arms and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that once every 5 years only vote for Labour or the Conservatives (or Lib Dems I guess) and limit democratic commitment to that is completely useless, both parties (to slightly different degrees) ruling essentially in favour of particular interests, multinational corporations and the rich, at no time he says to simply ignore politics completely because these parties do not rule on our behalf: he insists that instead of just voting and disconnecting for five years, people should become much more politically active at the local level, organize movements, demonstrations, petitions, no matter and try to influence politics from that.
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with its solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting its demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are giraffes who will change their mind if they really risk losing the elections), but it is furious to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells the young people not to bother to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were to debate what he really is saying rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and setting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely distorted.
The usefulness of dragging a ballot in a ballot box every five years makes me deeply upset because my vote really does not matter.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their constituents.
In addition, I contest the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his own (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "peudo-chomskyst."
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head shovels added to the montage!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him on his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he's coming from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
In my view, this sling reveals above all that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the Rendez-vous of history where trade historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of Sciences Po condensed ready-to-think for press files.
For my part I had seen in Pierre Bourdieu's intellectual attitude as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasonings, but this rationality is based on those scapegoats which are the keystone of their thinking.
I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also the magic thought.
The problem of the relationship is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing slope, neo-lib and / or /libertary (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing to go to seek the relief of the state for its markets ) in the sense of at least state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that self-organizes beautifully.
His thought is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals cited here.
Nor is there any support for it.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its god of that time, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oula, you probably read a cauliya too quickly if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet poses a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the membership mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left who don't stand for us to pass from allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is boundless.
An important point to add to this seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of whites!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them speak violently anti-white.
My father's not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity is spreading outside big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard the Australians' views on the Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I've met two of them in my life (one abroad), didn't keep any bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice that's the only reason I remembered they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don't remember who you meet, all people value each other, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
Let you and the other Russian here talk about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with the said white.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there's a lot of chance these Whites' parents would attack them PHYSICALly.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, she is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left such as the union of the judiciary...
@Marabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial community is quite right.
When at the Judicial Union, they represent only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of bias can be made on the basis of the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision as well as that of the magistrate's factual interpretation.
There remains then the tool required of the law to refocus the assessment on fundamentals.
The measurement of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, makes it necessary to distinguish between the error and the bias of judges.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice do not fall within those three groups.
Pretentiousness and lack of knowledge is not an objective analysis.
And if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If it is only by statistics implicitly revealing that it is going from low to low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption* of the judiciary.
Subject sensitive in proportion to the nuisance power* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The domain under consideration is that of the spoliation* of heirs committed by inheritance genealogists authorised by notaries, even by means of frauds in the proceedings*.
This profession earns a good year a good year 150 million euros while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the quasi-impunity of justice* of the French notariat.
For an understanding of their mechanism, a part of this was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in numerous disputes between genealogists and heirs reluctant to be so spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to the heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, built to suit his size and weight, and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors as never a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair looks EPIQUE.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the off-road tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a penchant for longboarding.
Here there are hills that they would like.
Prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so "you see."
The off-road tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, though.
Many of them have reasonable insurance at their disposal.
Only if they became disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know they're needed.
You can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not planned to be made.
I'm CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair doesn't come to the market, because apparently there's no way to drive that damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation and an illegal situation, since the blockade imposed a "collective penalty" on all civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects divert a little bit of their cement to the black market " ...
Oh, that's not wood tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million human beings have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The US has a well-kept land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built in reverse of the population who chose its masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the economy of sharing, not for profit.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It's always a lot cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who trust each other often stop using Airbnb and process directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"That she rents on"?
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to engage in a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, In short, it's really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and painted, sunken, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would always be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to moor him?
No Marine Le Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 Mass will be said!
Capitalism is not going to get poorer!
High finance, speculates, plays with our companies so our jobs, with our raw materials, so our purchases, our food therefore our food, with the structures of care therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy, it's finance."
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former economic minister of Rothschild Bank, to better defend the interests of banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else who was competent?
What do you call it, turning his jacket, lowering his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really refused to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book Castles of Steel suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was rough at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Falklands, where, on the photos showing the survivors being rescued, one sees a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among German ships as to the fate of the two battled cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped firing, and a chase began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he came closer he saw it was just a wreck.
The NÃ¼rnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, leaning and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After pointing its spotlight on the ship's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened fire, finally flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned about reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north."
So, if that is true, the Germans, groping in the dark before the invention of radar, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not seek survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger battleship of the Royal Navy in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in the confusion they left to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already harmed them and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several voices rise to the UMP to request that it be included in the law that an elected person definitively convicted be therefore definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect left-wing elected officials of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A REGISTRATION IN THE MUR DES CONS DES MAGISTRATES
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected areas?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to arm the very ones who will take advantage of their inviolability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobilism is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "Sows for Justice" they came from the provinces and didn't make a difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right trade unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a juridic-mediatic war against them.
Your statements are totally free.
If, at the present time, the right-wing is defaming judicial news, it is simply that it has committed acts that fall within the scope of the law!
There is no example of a left-wing personality that has had so much to do with Justice, but not all of those who have been the subject of his attention have been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it should also be recalled that the left-wing judiciary union is not the only judicial union and is a minority.
That a minister so strongly supports unions shows how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you are quoting may be a minority among magistrates, but its influence is great at Chancellery, it's no secret.
The question now is whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than investigating.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to lay charges and to incarcerate the all-one-each.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever come back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glamorous moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone would accept their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Directions fill the stadiums of the entire world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed with Eurovision, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else took part in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most of the stars who don't take part in the contests.
There are few who, after a tube, succeed in making others.
Anyway, most singers/groups can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name, has fans only in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical path of rock, even if in your dreams you think that all guitar enthusiasts who smoke grass in their father's garage and throw three chords on a poem level primary school will surely become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even release an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied â a distance that quickly turns to racism, because the sacralist ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and petrified with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, from practical considerations to everyday life.
Except that you interpret recklessly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it better not to admit that our Marianne and our MoliÃ¨res do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of object well defined and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's deco ephemere to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in archaeologists' interpretations!
Any other discipline would throw to the nettles interpretations not at all scientific that lasted the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When's a comparative review of the disciplines so we can laugh a little?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of salutary modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unwarranted!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, precious testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instincts" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have such high-performance technical and scientific resources that the interpretation of excavations is better but can always be called into question by other discoveries!
One is there in the midst (and old) of polemics on the shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The shamans of prehistory", especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published by the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get on with it.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we keep on three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn't watch a musical on that, though, that would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays true journalists, courageous, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than sniffing with these childish ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Go away then.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and to publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shockes you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net... ??
If the FOM chose not to show these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have released the safety because at the time another vehicle (e.g. spoiler) entered the circuit.
But it was necessary to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it advisable to advance the time of departure (tv, pub, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, I agree with you, too.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restaurant a chance to beat the English that led then...
You're falling apart on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I have a little time to untrace all your c*****ries.
No, just no.
There have been a lot of F1 conspiracies, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of the possibility of victory of one pilot to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that releases the safety because it's the FIA.
Size range.
In view of the amateur images, the absence of an image allows the FIA to avoid the awkward questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner shakes a green flag in full operation and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the commissioners is clearly waving a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark lack of confidence in the F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag regime AFTER the place of the accident, hence the agitated green flag.
That's the usual procedure.
The post of clerks just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 metres as well as 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal look.
Sensationalism sells commercials.
Before I thought that the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid that, in the end, it's just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Buzzing with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep people scared so we can keep them under control.
"When tabloids cough about Ebola, we all get fear" It should be "derailed," not "to cough."
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing".
I wonder if all the people who panic that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the coming apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridiculs beautifully and solidly this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media talk about most things with this upside-down optimism.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently scared and anxious (without coming to hysteria) for the government can make us slip when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it itself has invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing through fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still of this world almost 35 years later.
Besides, at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffed, living with the certainty of going through it for years .....
Testimony is completely useless.
As always when you talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric file mentions that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
So, what do you base the research on?
On fantasies?
Do you put at the same level fanciful theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the bogus word adulated by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'anesmbourg.
@Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords in the shrinks.
Cyrulnik made us the blow of "resilience".
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have made us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Sentinels of the Air could save us all from Farage and company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to bring the Sentinels out of the air...
Why not?
It was a great show and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to mind is humor like pipi-caca, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's series.
The kids were hanging up.
Ah, because it's a children's show?
UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Why don't you keep your Team America?
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the threads and the animation is well done. :-)
I can't wait to see this (although I'm an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to rebroadcast the old.
The show has almost never stopped broadcasting here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we've had one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 06:00.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-order commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now go up to 5:30 a.m., Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old "sad" guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the esplanade mosque!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have made it impossible to find anything.
The mount of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Can be in Argentina??
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, protrudes in the middle of the mosque of Omar.
For Muslims, Mohammed went up to heaven from this rock.
For Jews, this is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind him regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and scuttled it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown young half-dressed naiveds, alanguis on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
Too bad the photographer of Reuters did not take pictures of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to stoop the Jewish faithful below, praying at the Wall of Wailings.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is right, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that must be condemned.
This system is untenable and will end in tears.
The only way to put an end to this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be going in a spin, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have managed to convince their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time, and without hiding, they have given ever greater remuneration to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not tenable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of wailing and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not being fucked with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it's tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you've forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India, for example.
All this can't end well.
It was because we're in democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that's exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated behind your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat, and tears"?
That makes a great impact, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the 18th century there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (finally her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe herself in the safe of the eternal values of France, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the country's decline, globalisation, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more uncomfortable...
You still miss the sindicat of married men, celibataires, married women, celibataires, lost dogs, and I don't know what else.
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll syndicate.
You're warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of the interests of the categories, the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a breach of equality with the other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
One can very well imagine a system ensuring a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster insured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
All workers shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings."
This is absolutely essential with the advent of informational power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review". ????
Wait, the section was here, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I looked at, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, mmmh pie...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely enough, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has done like "boom, that's my fucking cake now eat it and bow to your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
In previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also this idea of "playing security, there's still next week" that disappears the last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing this to myself.
I am grateful to those who do and thus offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them, and they had to tinker with one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to decide, I don't know how they were able to choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the dry base (even though I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make any sense, in any case Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time allotted.
There's cancer, too, with the solar blows.
Definitely, everything is succeeding us right now.
We hope it's a bad time for humanity.
You're confusing solar wind with ultraviolet rays.
UV is mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "hunt" ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and "cancers".
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man, they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVC and lets UVA and most UVB pass through.
You know you don't have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a linger when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor clarification that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to say I'm a melanoma regular, UV just ACCELER its development.
They're not PROVOCING it.
For proof: not all tanned people may have melanomas.
Either, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live in a cellar, it is better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything else: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV causes melanoma directly.
Can we fold it?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the blender?
or pass it to the blender...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied and the robustness of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for its intended use.
I think the army would need something more resistant and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as front-line communication equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied
Except for a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already bent?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke on folding that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before we install specific software, we imagine that the phone was removed from the main production line and we don't see how it could return.
Therefore, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But, would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
Ah l article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in 'industrial' We highlight super u but all the signs and meme the small business are concerned How to eat good, organic avac â¬1650 (average salary in france)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After that everyone is free to put his priorities where he hears it.
For my part, the diet is one.
Go with no grudge, I'll kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It is the total unbundling thought-reason.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example, claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartufery, joining the left caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 discharges while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideology and tartufery, so don't be surprised to meet often critics about them.
Wow, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all the related details (aircraft, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I'm not.
The concept isn't that complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were to focus on ecologists in the short run.
Boboecolo is one of them, but it is only the most visible fringe of the ecologists because it is the one that infests the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look that giraffe in the face.
She's so badly made that she vaguely looks like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth of this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That is not really a proven fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy is realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art may be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real.
If you're just looking for this, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
Honesty obliges us to say that France is reducing its numbers, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drasticly, starting with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
The operative without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who lose a dimension of their activities or even part of their history.
Where's the promised Sanctuary?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look somewhere else to save money but not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, looking elsewhere where gabegie is certain.
May all those who have met little or no military thing dare to say here, with their eyes in their eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
That the same potion be applied to the entire public service and public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: Really Relood: Look at the inflation of public jobs in other ministries and you will understand why Defence can feel a little busy!
Yeah, the savings everyone agrees on saying they have to be done, so it has to be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls moan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because, in that case, it's a crime, not an economy.
Guignols, come on!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for the local authorities, history repeats itself every time the post is closed, maternity, hospital and barracks.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't like the savings in public spending.
This article is really the most amazing thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is depressing to scroll through his Facebook feed and to see that 80% of his friends started their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment".
I think they're gonna make it a movie.
He'll probably be basing himself on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes that his skirt got into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's totally stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the "Internet".
So I don't think I can comment.
Don't have a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling for it!
It is essential that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible fulgurance and insurmountable genius that comes out of Mr. Brooker's keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, God, that was really bad.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development in democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are confiscated the right to save our planet by states that play tartuffes at every meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, as citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are tomorrow's Round Points.
It's all financed by the con-tribable.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not fully controlled, it is best to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided of course we drastically reduce our consumption.
Electricity through renewables to combat CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for the other stages.
Electricity by wind turbines or PV is already more GHGs in the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentity.
Replace nuclear power with wind turbines or PVs would run counter to CO2 control.
Christial I do not insult you I am a State Doctor in Physical Sciences 1981 and I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I didn't say it was you who lent me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany nothing in fact you didn't answer what I said and like all the right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do it.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be halted.
0 emissions if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count water vapour greenhouse gases with less effect than Co2 it is true that two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant is driven by water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant"...!!
The last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised that most of the Indians who post comments want to read and comment only on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India a South Asian giant...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are participating, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would just open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening game was surprisingly interesting, Kolkata's Athletico winning 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our "noisy neighbors"...
The low cost pitcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design failure occurs only with a helium that is too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, but in implementation...
Unlike arianspace, which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay the satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more unfortunate since many media are looping in the only titles of articles - and many readers only retain these titles.
In total this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
I agree with you that the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project when it is only a launcher problem.
