Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and in the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is at different stages, the VOCID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services must prepare for a peak of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, particularly intensive care.
On December 31, 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia from unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with VOCID-19 have a benign condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which is healing.
In approximately 14% of cases, VOCID-19 results in a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
Inpatient mortality due to VOCID-19 is approximately 4%.
As part of this study, we assess the evolution of the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with developments in the Hubei province of China.
We also compare the current number of cases of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Case of VOCID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, VOCID-19 has continued to spread, and the dynamics of the VOCID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On March 11, 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared VOCID-19 a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of VOCID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of VOCID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK) with 39,768 cases and 1,727 reported deaths between 31 December 2019 and 1,727 between 17 750 cases and 1,441 deaths for Italy only.
Obtaining cumulative number and cumulative incidence of cases of VOCID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of VOCID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare it with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active cases of VOCID-19, we calculated the cumulative 14-day incidence of cases of VOCID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of VOCID-19, within each EU/EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of cases reported in each country at 8 a.m. on 15 March 2020 with Italy's data for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Developments in VOCID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The 14-day cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 began to increase around 21 February before experiencing a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of VOCID-19 in EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As at 8 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of VOCID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of the cumulative incidence of VOCID-19 suggests that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for VOCID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, physicians in the affected regions of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of patients with VOCID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of cases of VOCID-19 to hospitals and/or intensive care are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A 2010–11 study showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds and intermediate beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010–11).
Modeling scenarios for patient capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of in-patient cases of VOCID-19 associated with risk > 90% of bed capacity exceedance in intensive care, are provided in the sixth update of the Rapid Risk Assessment of the CEPCM for VOCID-19.
Given that cases were previously grouped in some regions of EU/EEA and UK countries, and that hospitals and intensive care services generally accommodate a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be compiled at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the VOCID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community-based SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and for an increase in the number of patients with VOCID-19 requiring care, particularly intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow sufficient time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
The rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window during which each country will be able to strengthen its control efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries will face a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 Coronavirus Disease Epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which resulted in thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, VOCID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissive, and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this paper seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this emerging research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still awaiting answers, we hope that this review will contribute to a better understanding and eradication of this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, has forever marked the Chinese, who have been forced to remain cloistered for the duration of the golden week as well as for long weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; that is why it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease called coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic started in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, VOCID-19 is "public enemy number 1", potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on VOCID-19, particularly in the fields of virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the sequence of the virus, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize research progress on this emerging topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare VOCID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, an epidemic that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of prevention and prognosis of the disease, and address some issues that are still pending but urgent.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, primarily causing about 15% common colds 4.
However, during this century, we experienced two highly pathogenic coronaviruses for humans, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an epidemic that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current VOCID-19 is therefore the third outbreak of coronavirus in recent history.
As presented in Fig.1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to the Chinese National Health Commission in Wuhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was unveiled.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had spread rapidly to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was placed in quarantine with interruption of all its public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO described the epidemic as a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remain to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of VOCID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but most of them in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over the age of 50, very few were under the age of 20, and only 14 were under the age of 10.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31/100,000) more than women (0.27/100,000).
VOCID-19 developed in homes, mainly in Hubei province and on the periphery.
The average duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of VOCID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The base reproductive rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for VOCID-19 were sex (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large wrapped viruses containing single stranded RNA.
They can be classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronaviruses known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The Spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms vesicles containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be a new type of betacoronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples collected from the outbreak site, the seafood market from Huanan to Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultrafine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new orf3b-encoded short protein as well as an orf8-encoded secreted protein.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b could play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain known functional domains or patterns.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the cryo-ME structure of the complete human ACE2 at a resolution of 2.9 Å in complex with the amino acid transporter B06T1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing indications for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
It was established that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and were transmitted to humans via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native SARS-CoV-2 host, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is still to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, implying homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a mammal with a long snout feeding ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on the 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two genomes is a significant difference, so conclusive results can be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40 to 50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may well have similar properties.
It appears that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and at a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular motif recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll type receptors (TLRs), NOD type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I type receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, maturation of dendritic cells, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein can allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Help T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defense cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing their apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can result in serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multi-visceral failure, even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect the elderly with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
It is commonly accepted that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1 to 14 days, but more generally 3 to 7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, concluded that an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) was based on a demography of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to prevent infected but asymptomatic people from transmitting the virus.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of VOCID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhoea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and/or hypoxaemia one week after the onset of the disease.
For serious cases, patients quickly developed acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study conducted at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported from two recent studies of a family and an outbreak following transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a demographic study conducted in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of patients with MERS-CoV were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than patients with VOCID-19, which is consistent with a higher lethality of MERS compared to VOCID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
With respect to SARS, it was determined that the main symptoms were fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), dyspnoea (40%-42%), diarrhoea (20%-25 %) and sore throat (13%-25 %), and that ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, VOCID-19 mortality was 2% for 66,576 confirmed cases worldwide.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality, and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is far more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
The appearance of a home often occurs within a family or in a rally or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients have often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have been in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without having symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients who have recovered may be carriers of the virus again, highlighting the need to increase quarantine time.
Patients have normal or reduced peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with 4 × 109/L white blood cells and 1 × 109/L lymphocytes, aspartate aminotransferase and viraemia were identified in 1,099 patients with VOCID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the level of D-dimer, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was gradually decreasing.
Thoracic X-ray abnormalities were observed in most patients with VOCID-19, characterized by uneven bilateral shadows or unpolished glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid build-up and progressive fibrosis seriously compromises gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease in surfactant levels and an increase in surface tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to inflate and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most worrying chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of VOCID-19 revealed a desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of hyaline membranes, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which coincides with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and is similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary endpoint for the diagnosis of VOCID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation was observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential and imperative to establish an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique using CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a reactive strip in less than one hour, without the need for sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use in clinical specimens proves successful.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide support care for patients with VOCID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even the plasma of restored patients has been proposed for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are all working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory insufficiency are the main threat to patients, and the leading cause of death.
Thus, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shocks, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Excessive immune response has been shown to cause cytokinic shock in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a range of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multivisceral failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in severe cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, were used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shocks include modulation of immune response by T cells, blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF cytokines, inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 report suppressor and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, the use of high-dose steroids did not have a beneficial effect on severe lung damage in SARS and VOCID-19 patients.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including vascular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low-to-moderate dose corticosteroids was recommended for patients with a severe form of VOCID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in a U.S. patient with VOCID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remedesivir also demonstrated a potential inhibition of other single strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow a number of trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results are highly expected.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur as a result of combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients restored and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from this disease is an ancestral practice.
Indeed, patients recovered often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize molecules unique in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who had cured VOCID-19 and injected 10 seriously affected patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully examined.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause a potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from patients restored and to identify genetic codes encoding relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow for a rapid increase in antibody production.
TCM has been used for millennia in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components into a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known to the extent that it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, because of the absence of specific effective treatment for VOCID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or in remission of a serious form of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in treating VOCID-19.
The best recovery rates for VOCID-19 were observed in provinces in China that used TCM for 87% of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used only 30% of VOCID-19 patients, had the lowest healing rate (13%).
However, this is a rather approximate comparison since many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be taken into account in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western medicine only with combined treatment combining MO and TCM.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to disappear, and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only.
Even more impressive, the rate of aggravation of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% vs. 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO+MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% vs. 39%).
Nevertheless, the efficacy and safety of TCM still need to be clarified through larger-scale controlled trials and more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of VOCID-19 generally experience serious concern for this highly contagious and deadly disease, and quarantined individuals also experience a feeling of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects of treatments, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, can lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early stages of the SARS epidemic, multiple psychiatric morbiditys have been reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confusion and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact research and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the VOCID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of patients about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of family and friends.
For example, mental health care must be provided to patients with VOCID-19, to individuals identified as probable cases, to people in contact with these populations, and to any other person in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and human beings infected with vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce potent long-term neutralizing antibodies and/or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and models subjected to lethal provocation, as well as their protection against infection with a zoonotic virus, still need to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for unimmunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective in order to control the ongoing epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the large time frame (18 months on average) needed to develop a vaccine and dynamic variations in coronaviruses.
Since it is an emerging disease, VOCID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are gradually recovering without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, VOCID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality for the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies to date, factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with VOCID-19 are as follows (Table 33):
Age: Age was the main factor for the prognosis of SARS, and this also appears to be the case for VOCID-19.
VOCID-19 mainly affects individuals aged 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% over 50 years of age based on a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying co-morbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for patients with VOCID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and Complications: Patients with VOCID-19 requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute heart damage and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been established that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may result in liver dysfunction in patients with VOCID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, response to treatment, and healing.
Correlation of CRP with severity and prognosis of VOCID-19 has also been proposed.
Furthermore, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released in the event of tissue damage.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: thoracic X-ray results and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with other elements for the prognosis and complications of VOCID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used in complementary treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS cases, many survivors experienced vascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroid administration to patients with VOCID-19 should be limited to a low dose and to a short duration.
Mental Stress: As described above, the outbreak of VOCID-19 has resulted in a large number of exceptional stress cases, with patients often experiencing long periods of quarantine, extreme uncertainty, and the deaths of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to provide long-term psychological support and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and regain a normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, VOCID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause or cause little or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, like coronaviruses that cause common colds.
As a result, newly infected or incubationally infected individuals can produce a large amount of viruses during their daily activities, which significantly impedes control of the epidemic.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by severely ill patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
As a result, the current outbreak of VOCID-19 is far more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are currently being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all the population with a view to halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy as well as other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that VOCID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in the mid-nasal and throat samples of patients recovered 2 weeks after discharge from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
According to initial forecasts, Ebola was expected to cause up to 1 million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or evolve into a less pathogenic virus co-existing with humans.
A comparison of the outbreak of VOCID-19 with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by coughing or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, thus revealing a new possibility of fecooral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 health care professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of the sick, and even any person likely to be in contact with infected patients or persons.
The first line of defence possible to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and breathing masks N95 (1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they may be transmitted to others.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against the inhalation of virions from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of fully entering; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both are approximately 85 nm.
Given that particles are able to pass through five surgical masks stacked together, it is imperative that health care professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks, not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care professionals must wear adjusted insulation jackets to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body by the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective glasses in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum extent and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre from the sick.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on January 19, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the population that the new virus was not contagious, that it had limited interhuman transmissibility and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message has led to a notable release, especially at a time when the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan has been missed.
Chinese disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, because each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to the unusual data of clinics rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic in its early stages rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) perform more targeted and relevant exercises in order to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to regularly test and improve society's response system.
The VOCID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Given that this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and that the symptoms of VOCID-19 are also similar to those of SARS, the outbreak of VOCID-19 gives rise to an impression of pre-vu.
However, there are significant differences between VOCID-19 and SARS, which need to be considered in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
VOCID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; severity and mortality rates are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality than VOCID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Transmission of the VOCID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of VOCID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular SARS-CoV-2 RNA tests may be negative for some patients with VOCID-19.
On the other hand, patients recovered may be positive for the virus again.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite the rapid progress in research on VOCID-19, several critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology was established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronaviruses from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to effectively interrupt transmission, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus enter respiratory tract cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it evolve into a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like the flu?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all of these and many others.
However, regardless of the costs involved, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our lives.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients experienced severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The first case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
In addition to supertransmitters, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4-7 days, with peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests, and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in case of SARS suspicion.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20 to 30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which can be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolite is common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized due to pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present globally, causing moderate respiratory disease.
Generally, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and maintain themselves continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most deadly viruses known in humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid global spread.
Comparison and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of the symptoms of VOCID-19 lies between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoVs (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of VOCID-19 is also observed as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and long-term diffusion after transmission to humans, will influence the ultimate fate of the current outbreak of VOCID-19.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms have adapted well to humans.
In other words, both could be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to occur, HCoVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
In this context, the more persistent the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and the greater the number of infected people, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If he adapts well, his transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about forty or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community acquired CoVs have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent subjects.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their transmission between humans is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four community acquired HCoVs.
However, it is more pathogenic than community acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and will circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoV.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of a HCoV if it is home to a close ascendant sharing a high homology at the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses the HCoV continuously and over the long term.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate hosts for amplifiers cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genomic sequence.
These studies laid the foundation for a new concept that bats are host to emerging human pathogens.
The human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
This is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive with specific antibodies neutralizing MERS-CoV, as well as camels from the Middle East in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only by the respiratory tract, but also by faeces, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot exclude the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than the distance between beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin.
Recombination is a common factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoV, zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from bat CoV, whereas the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs close to HCoV-229E have been found.
First of all, unlike alpacas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, the alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E-like bat is numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alpha-CoV of alpaca caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah and Hendra.
It is therefore no wonder that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Another possibility, while bat alpha-CoVs are used as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could serve as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known through its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have passed from intermediate host to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if any, is different.
In particular, the beta-CoV of pangolin is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-like virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through removal or coal mines.
Second, pangolins may be one of the intermediate amplifier hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the removal and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single strand RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of CoV could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
Nevertheless, the mutation rates of CoVs are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, mutation rates are often high when CoVs have not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, with a high rate of mutation, the rate of mutation of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that he has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoVs randomly and frequently change models during RNA replication using a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for CoV observed in animals such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction related to transmission
Beyond the above three viral factors, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in adapting the virus to humans.
It is interesting to note that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study showed an affinity 10 to 20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emergence of new HCoV: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoVs offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs are genetic reserves of HCoVs.
Among the ancillary proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but codified divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal splits ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and is perceived as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced recombination episodes between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats appeared to have adapted well to CoV from anatomically and physiologically.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROD) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress replication of CoV and affect "rereading" by exoribonuclease, creating selective pressure and giving rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong host immune response.
It is here that lies the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of CoV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasoma is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
CoVs have returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, with very high zoonotic potential.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches in natural zoonose reservoirs.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five, accounting for nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Two times a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin, since lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can be used to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more efficient than cold and soapy water to remove natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of lukewarm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to moisten or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid removal activity from microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have water and soap at your fingertips.
Frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have had long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make a difference).
Sprinkle a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rub action creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rub longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pour water from a can or gourd suspended and drilled and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended with a rope, and a pedal allowing to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying hands in hot air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and by 254% on the palms.
Drying with air jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of hand washing may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to fuel behaviour change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fetid smells called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand-washing techniques" have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.

It should also be stressed that artificial selection can contribute to unintentional changes in the genomes of viruses, which most likely follow the pressures exerted during selection, notably by the host's immune system.
An example is the loss of the complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV has a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a lag in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
Bats appeared to have adapted well to CoV from anatomically and physiologically.
For example, abnormalities in the activation of pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibiting natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and by the low expression rate of molecules in the major Class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (ROD) generated by high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress replication of CoV and affect "rereading" by exoribonuclease, creating selective pressure and giving rise to highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve by recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong host immune response.
It is here that lies the secrets of observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from the replication of CoV.
The same strategy for dissociating the immune response could have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammasoma is deficient in bats.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasoma with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of VOCID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civettes and other animals on the market have been found to be carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate intermediate SARS-CoV-2 host has been identified.
Pangolin beta-CoVs remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, either voluntarily or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the ramp due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
CoV studies in bats and other animals have significantly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoV to humans.
There has been extensive evidence that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from the bat and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection is the result of contact between humans and civettes in the marketplace, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civettes in the market could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
Based on the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the fresh product markets to avoid zoonoses transmission, given the discovery of many beta-CoV lines of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how this transmission occurs will remain to be determined in subsequent studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoVs, with very high zoonotic potential.
There are many opportunities for these zoonotic CoVs to evolve and recombine, causing the emergence of new, more transmissible and/or fatal CoVs in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and VOCID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics that support the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are aware of the need to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from ecological niches in natural zoonose reservoirs.
We don't yet know all the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit a parent SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including men, bats and pangolins.
Finally, given that many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it should be possible to identify SARS-CoV-2 or near-identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts.
Future research in this area will help elucidate the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of VOCID-19 in humans.
Update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases" of VOCID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team released a Rapid Recommendation Directive for the diagnosis and treatment of the new 2019 coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV) and this directive described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic globally.
However, the 2019 Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge are gradually progressing on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, strategies for diagnosis and treatment are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment on our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of VOCID-19 (Seventh Version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that now officially bears the name of 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, the WHO described the VOCID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was posted online on Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted a great deal of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that VOCID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing slowly on the basis of the results of ongoing studies and experience of clinical practice; therefore, strategies for diagnosis and treatment are also constantly updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which have been substantially modified.
Having received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We approve of their important work and thank them.
However, their work must also be updated in accordance with the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of VOCID-19 (test version 7) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), confirmation of a suspect case must combine one of the features of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to form a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucleic acids); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in a reduced area such as home, office, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of an infection with VOCID-19; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the beginning of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with the known new coronaviruses; (3) serological positive test for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgG antibody; or modification of SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG antibody from negative to positive or titre increase ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic blood sample testing was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020) and serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood sampling, with increased availability of different specimens, and contributed to the addition of the specific antibody positive result to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with regard to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphic representation of Zhou et al. should be updated as they classified people with no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The evaluation system must also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspect cases" and "confirmed cases", we suggest that they follow and comply with the latest guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to VOCID-19, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new VOCID-19-related deaths in one day.
As a result, the country has recorded a record number of deaths due to the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected people registered included 114 active cases and 33 people cured, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
On March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
All over the world, countries have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's confinement until May 1.
The Parliament of Portugal voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an infection with HCoV could be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of CoV-host interactions in animals could also provide a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Based on differences in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the primary reservoir of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and restrictive factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the SARS-CoV-2 reservoir, intermediate and amplifier host(s), with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract from patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are present all over the world and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter in temperate countries.
Stores in Australia reduce the amount of toilet paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their toilet paper purchase restrictions to two and one per purchase at all national stores, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a one-package limit.
These limits have been displayed in the form of messages to the caisses and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently raised reserves out of fear of VOCID-19 and the need to confide.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted toilet paper purchases for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous purchase restriction of four packages introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, said that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still out of stock within one hour of delivery," and called the request "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Facebook publication on Tuesday, called it "unexpected."
Sales rose sharply last week, according to a spokesperson for Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the permitted quantity to two packages last week.
In order to further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased the delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stock available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Association, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It anticipates an increase in production costs, while suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are unable to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr.Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at Queensland University of Technology, explained that stores replenish inventory every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in a small quantity of stock that, once exhausted, leaves large open spaces, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider that if the rays are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap declared last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the toilet paper Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures the Sorbent paper, pointed out that they work 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to News.com.au's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because the buyers were on leave during the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report from ABC Australia, in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchasing restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday night that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization calls VOCID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current outbreak of VOCID-19 (the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus) as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the danger of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments into action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned not only about the alarming levels of spread and severity, but also about the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He said, in comments published by CNN in February, that "other than influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed from its onset to its continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, stating that "we have never witnessed a coronavirus pandemic."
To which he added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows WHO's decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said with respect to the epidemic: "To shorten the situation, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of VOCID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic has been an epidemic of coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on January 30, 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of VOCID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are cured.
The lethality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The delay between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from others, and monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by introducing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closures.
The pandemic has led to serious global socio-economic disruptions, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, as well as widespread shortages compounded by panic shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, accounting for approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese, other people of Asian origin and appearance from East and South-East, as well as against other people from regions with many cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an unknown case of pneumonia on December 31, 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market and it is therefore thought that the virus would be zoonotic in origin.
The virus that caused the epidemic is called SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first known person with symptoms became ill on December 1, 2019, and this person was not clearly linked to the subsequent focus of the fresh product market.
Of the cases of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unaudited report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could be dated November 17, 2019, for a 55-year-old in Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a significant underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, those aged 19 and under representing 2.4% of cases worldwide. UK Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population had to be infected before they could achieve effective collective immunity.
Cases refer to the number of individuals who have been tested at VOCID-19 and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that until January 23, China estimated 86% of undetected VOCID-19 infections, and that these unregistered infections were the source of 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
The first estimates of the base reproductive rate (R0) of VOCID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with VOCID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the delay between the onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to VOCID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80 per cent of deaths were among those over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent were affected by pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Formal counts of deaths associated with the VOCID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died and were tested positive for VOCID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of VOCID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include untested deaths - e.g. at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy indicate that the excess mortality figures during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official count of the deaths of VOCID.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports from the U.S. undervaluation. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia took place in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the outbreak, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, case-to-death estimates decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms that occurred between January 1 and January 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms that occurred after February 1, 2020). The other indicators are the lethality rate (fatality rate), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who succumb to a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who succumb to a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the overall pandemic infection rate is between 0.1 and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for VOCID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on lethality estimates.
WHO argues that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to regress when the disease comes to lack available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant predictions at the moment about when this will happen."
Chief Medical Adviser to the Chinese government Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be completed by June" if all countries are able to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more).
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus—because it is very easily transmitted—will disappear completely" and that it "could turn into a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on the collective immunity and the extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of VOCID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptysis, diarrhoea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States (CDC) identify emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult wake-ups, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. The subsequent development of the disease can result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without any clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so the researchers made recommendations that people who have had close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and examined to avoid the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the delay between contamination and onset of symptoms) varies between one and 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with VOCID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods, which could be projected by speaking. Respiratory droplets can also be projected during the expiration, especially by speaking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postmounds can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore cause aerial spread.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by stools, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of fecooral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days following the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of laboratory-confirmed asymptomatic cases exist, but asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact investigation.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Domestic animals and other animals have been tested positive for VOCID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other areas that infected people may have affected.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus initially isolated in three individuals with pneumonia associated with Wuhan's acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
It is thought to be zoonotic.
A genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lignage B) associated with two strains from bats.
It is 96% identical to the whole genome of another bat coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin and human viruses.
Comparison of the entire genome has revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to demonstrate that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however final confirmation is made by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or scanners.
A study comparing the PCR and the scanner to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the scanner not be used to detect or as a first-line test to diagnose VOCID-19."
The WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the chain reaction by real-time polymerase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a rhinopharynx sample, but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On April 6, 2020, none of them proved to be reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
The characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans of people with symptoms include asymmetrical depolitic glass opacities and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently establishing an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to cross-checking with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-confirmed imaging is of limited accuracy to detect VOCID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scanners to PCR and showed that while imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Networks of convolutive neurons based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect characteristics of the virus in both X-ray and scanner imaging.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include generally having good personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
Those who had already been contaminated were advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have banned or advised against all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
Nevertheless, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that the virus is spreading in communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been contaminated. Health care professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions and contact precautions, and wear protective goggles. Searching for contacts is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of an infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments in this regard has raised issues of confidentiality, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a press release calling for limitations on such surveillance.
Various mobile apps were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive for VOCID-19. Misconceptions are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing their nose and gargaging with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against VOCID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having sneezed, coughed, or sneezed.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (in one minute of disinfectant exposure for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50–100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2–7.5% povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of VOCID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or crèche, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick persons, be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their bent elbows or a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and to throw away any handkerchief immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who would be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by projected postillons by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, virologist at Leeds University, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hand hygiene."The use of masks was also recommended to those who care for a person potentially affected by the disease.
WHO has recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they care for a patient with VOCID-19, even if it recognizes that wearing the mask can help people not touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their populations to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-medical masks made of fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks to healthy people, especially in the case of proximity (1 metre (3 feet) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make facial masks at home and clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without masks or other means of covering its nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the wearing of the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone would protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a supermarket wears a mask.
Israel has asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on long distance train and bus passengers on 1 April.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisanal mask to those who cannot buy one.
Masks were also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
The methods of social distancing can be applied by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowds, saluting without contact and keeping physical distance from others.
Many governments now order or recommend social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of VOCID-19 in the area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people, with older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or weakened immune systems at an increased risk of serious illness and complications, and were invited by the CDC to stay home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health organizations began replacing the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by preserving social ties, whether virtually or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested that total social isolation should be used, rather than encouraging people to maintain contact with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with a person with whom you live, who does not have the virus or who does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation has been recommended for those diagnosed positive for VOCID-19 and those who think they are infected.
Health organizations have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strictest individual quarantine instructions were given to people in the most at risk groups.
People who have been exposed to a patient with VOCID-19 and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very important were invited to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Control strategies for an epidemic are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented during the early stages of the epidemic and aims to monitor and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce further infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are moving towards the mitigation phase: measures are being taken to slow down the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Restriction and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time.
Elimination requires more extreme measures, in order to influence the pandemic by reducing the basic reproductive count to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is called flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, masking and individual quarantine; public social distancing measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; a public effort to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions such as surface cleaning. More drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China since the seriousness of the epidemic has become apparent, such as the quarantine of entire cities and a strict ban on travel.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to infected persons who have quarantined themselves, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the grabbing of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (the slowdown but not the elimination of the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the spread of the epidemic) face major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce the demand for health care by 2/3 and deaths by half, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Removal may be preferred, but should be continued as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), because if not, the transmission bounces rapidly when the measures are relaxed.
The long-term response to the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for VOCID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing treatments.
The use of non-prescription cold or drinking medications and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of VOCID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" may soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of patients with VOCID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response measure to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have published guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources at various levels, including by devoting laboratory services to VOCID-19 testing, cancelling non-emergency interventions where possible, separating and insulating patients tested positive for VOCID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus at Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, it would have a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei province hospital, which informed the CDC of Wuhan Jianghan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumours, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission then issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, aided by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transport hub as well as a major railway interchange.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 healed.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted travel and introduced border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantine (also called home, shelter or containment orders) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are subjected to some form of containment in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined to the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in a form of confinement, a figure of 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of VOCID-19 was dated December 1, 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first case would date back to November 17.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December, and informed Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed the same day.
The doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "propagating rumors" about the epidemic.
The China National Health Commission initially claimed that there was no "evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine in human history", a medical cordon was announced on 23 January to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which was extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) have been cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat the additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other structures in Wuhan, such as congress and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the VOCID-19 epidemic, including issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the spring holidays.
The country's universities and schools have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several Chinese regions.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been changed and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
Control of population displacement has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have been affected by some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a quarantine of 14 days for all international travellers entering the city. By 23 March, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted within the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang said that the spread of cases within the country was essentially blocked, and that the epidemic was controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after the beginning of the confinement. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence holders would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy was to end.

The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on 30 March, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Affairs Council announced a day of mourning to start with three minutes of silence on 4 April at 10:00 a.m., which coincides with Qingming's celebration, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distancing and avoid a renewal of the VOCID-19 epidemic.
It was confirmed that VOCID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases on 20 February, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji's followers who were visiting Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of having caused the epidemic.
On February 22, 1,261 or about 13% of the church's 9,336 faithful reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
The airlines' schedules have also been reached and therefore changed. South Korea has introduced what was considered the largest and best organized programme in the world to test the population with the virus, isolate all infected persons and monitor and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile application, virus testing drives delivering results the following day, and increased testing capacity to allow testing of nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is seen as a success in controlling the epidemic, although it has not quarantined entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, commending its response.
On 23 March, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that as of 1 April, all persons arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.

Long distance travel restriction plans were announced in March, although heavy traffic between cities in anticipation of the Norouz Persian New Year continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
On the basis of allegations of possible cover-up of the spread of the epidemic in Iran, more than ten countries had located the origin of their cases in Iran on 28 February, suggesting that the epidemic was perhaps more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government on that date.
The Iranian parliament was closed, while 23 of its 290 members reported positive testing of the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to release all eligible prisoners temporarily.
The organization stated that there is a greater risk of spread of the virus in closed institutions such as detention centres, which also lack medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the country's largest total since the outbreak.
At least 12 former or current Iranian politicians and government members had died of the disease on 17 March.
On March 23, Iran knew 50 new cases per hour and another death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to one WHO representative, there could be five times more cases in Iran than the number reported.
It is also suggested that United States sanctions may undermine the country's financial capacity to respond to the epidemic.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
It was confirmed that the epidemic spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
The cases began to increase rapidly, causing the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A non-linked outbreak of VOCID-19 was later detected, with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the epidemic, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people in 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "In areas affected by the epidemic, no entry or exit will be allowed.
The suspension of professional activity and sporting events has already been ordered in these areas." On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities in the country while Italy had 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including football Serie A matches, were scheduled to be held in camera until April, but on March 9, the whole sport was suspended for a minimum of one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of virtually all commercial activity, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies.

As at 5 April, Italy recorded 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures; the majority of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its obvious lack of responsiveness and alertness in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, advising against all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational establishments such as pubs and sports halls should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, up to £2,500 per month, in order to avoid the unemployment caused by the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, prohibiting rallies of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to the strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, these restrictions were subject to police sanctions, including fines and dispersal of rallies.
Most businesses were ordered to close, with the exception of businesses deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, DIY stores, gas stations and garages.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control, the U.S. government's leading public health institute, announced that it had developed its own screening kit.
Despite this, the United States took time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were tainted by defective screening kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental screening kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for eligibility for testing until early March (a mandatory physician order later).
On 27 February, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
On 13 March, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

In early March, the Indian government began evacuating its citizens from Iran. On 14 March, a South African Airways aircraft chartered by the South African government repatriated 112 South African citizens.
A medical screening was conducted prior to departure and four South Africans who showed signs of coronavirus remained in place to reduce the risk.
Only those South Africans whose test was negative were repatriated.
The test results exempted all South Africans, including crew members, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers involved in the humanitarian mission, all of whom, as a precautionary measure, remained in observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at Ranch Resort.
On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical equipment and experts to help Italy cope with the Coronavirus epidemic.
Businessman Jack Ma sent 1.1 million screening kits, 6 million protective masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution by the African Union.
He subsequently sent 5,000 screening kits, 100,000 protective masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
I also donated medical equipment to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and screening kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits manufactured in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese protective masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to come from China, but they actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the Latin American and African regions. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
The WHO praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities in the management and containment of the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS epidemic of 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment having impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis where the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a travel ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was "arguably not a WHO recommendation", it was, however, a "very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and he spoke of a fact "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following confirmation of interhuman transmission outside China and an increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the epidemic to be an international public health emergency (IPPH), the sixth USPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros said: "There is no reason for unnecessary measures to interfere with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel".
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million to strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have the necessary systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear".
Tedros then declared that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO set out in a press conference that the disease was called VOCID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "force of the entire United Nations system into the response".
A UN crisis management team has therefore been activated to coordinate the United Nations response as a whole, which according to WHO will enable them to "focus on health response while other agencies will be able to provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to dispatch international experts and WHO to China to support national management and assess "severity and transmission of disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and conducting field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," indicating that although it is too early to speak of a pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter "preparation phase".
In response to the spread of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint field mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives reported that the global threat assessment of coronavirus had increased from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready," adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan then indicated that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, stating that such a statement would mean that "we accept absolutely that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticisms of its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, notably due to the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the VOCID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone was entitled to relief assistance and that that responsibility lay with the Government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International government organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the VOCID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in the various countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the challenge posed by coronavirus.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British minister of the office of Michael Gove and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for managing the pandemic, which began in the Hubei province of China.
Several provincial administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) have been relieved of their duties as a result of their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of politicians to the epidemic in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger over the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected the basic idea that the coronavirus epidemic started in Wuhan in favour of conspiracy theories that VOCID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
Donald Trump's US administration called the coronavirus a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," saying that in China "censorship has overnourished a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which was later called racism by some opponents and intended to "distract attention from the inability of its administration to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government outlining a communication scheme apparently emanating from the National Security Council, the strategy of which is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to communicate this message in every possible way, including at press conferences and television appearances."Press outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda surge to gain global influence.
EU foreign policy leader Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and "politics of generosity".
Borrell also stated that "China aggressively insists that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid a priori to the latter two countries.
The 100,000 masks donated by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other mask-related conflicts have also been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of breathers destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the European Union's lack of solidarity with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that "only China had responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-ranking political source" which indicated that 80 per cent of Russian aid was "not very useful for Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitics and diplomacy".
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane to the United States for medical assistance.
The spokesman for the Kremlin Dmitri Peskov stated that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that once the American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment gain speed, they will be able to make them the same if necessary."
The scale of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, NATO's largest manoeuvre since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for assistance on 14 March 2020, stating that Iran was struggling to combat the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of the United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has led to calls for the United States to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated as a result of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about the response to President Moon Jae-in's crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or, on the contrary, for its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, to suspend the parliament and the elections and to punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The Coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several instances of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and a disruption in the operation of factories and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings regarding shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruptions.
Several communities also faced panic purchases that resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, from shelves, resulting in shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted about delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by 100.
This has led to an increase in prices of up to 20 times the normal price and has also led to delays in the supply of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment around the world, and WHO warns that this will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for daigos to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of VOCID-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food products, these two areas were spared from severe food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal stockpiling and trade of essential products were a real success, thus avoiding the severe food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe as well as in North America.
Due to its large agricultural output, Northern Italy did not see a significant decline, but prices could rise according to industry representatives.
The food shelves were empty only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government released pork reserves to ensure a sufficient livelihood for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy for food producers to store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy were felt in China: a media report of 16 March indicated that China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 as a result of the government's efforts to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5 per cent.
Since mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral epidemic has been found to pose a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain unstable until a clearer picture emerges on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the impact of the 2002-2004 SARS epidemic.
An expert estimate from Washington University in Saint-Louis reported an impact of more than $300 billion on the global supply chain, which could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is said to have "frozen" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to the decline in demand in China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 following a significant increase in the number of cases of VOCID-19 outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of growing concern about the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock market indices including NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their strongest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones down to 1,191 points, the largest one-day decline since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign debt rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
Actions fell again due to fears related to coronavirus, with the largest decline on 16 March.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did in the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public space, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise sector has reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivities, and private companies have also independently closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to the lunar New Year have been cancelled and many tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holidays until February 10, by requiring most workplaces not to reopen until February 10.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency situation, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in opening hours of shops or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a decline of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping centres in March compared to February.
The operators of shopping centres around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a pandemic-free situation.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, many of the more than 300 million rural migrant workers found themselves stranded at home in inner provinces or stuck in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied to the government for help.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32 per cent, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving daily wages) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44 per cent of Canadian households had experienced some type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement imposed in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Nearly half a million German companies switched their employees to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time compensation scheme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both waged and self-employed, at the global level.
Arts and culture organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists as much as possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which take place the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home rather than attend Sunday Masses; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live, or on television, while others offer to practice their worship in "drive-in".
Like the Roman Catholic diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels and St Peter's Square, which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the epidemic and the holy sites were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims as well as its inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest interruption in the world's sport calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-20, the 2019-20 England Football Championship, UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The epidemic disrupted the organisation of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than the summer of 2021." Casinos and other gaming institutions around the world have closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gambling sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of entertainment has also been affected, with several music groups having suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway's, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet to replace traditional live performances, such as live and online concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
On-line, many Internet memes on the theme of coronavirus have spread as many favour humour and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the VOCID-19 epidemic, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents related to fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that Chinese people deserved the virus or received justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to the Chinese, both online and offline, and to the inhabitants of the areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the epidemic to new and sensitive countries, Italians, who lived in the first country in Europe to undergo a serious outbreak of VOCID-19, could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese from entering their country in order to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was furious on Twitter.
Chinese as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for calling the coronavirus "Chinese virus", a term that his critics consider racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, demonstrators attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in major Indian cities are reported to have been harassed in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The president of the West Bengal unit of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that is why God took his revenge on them".
The remarks were subsequently condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, which calls them "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were fueled by the pandemic, as foreigners were described as "foreign waste" that should be "disposal".
Many paid access newspapers have removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made available their scientific articles in connection with the open-access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for 2019 Coronavirus Respiratory Disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the virus and detecting antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used for both population diagnosis and surveillance.
Antibodies tests reveal how many people contracted the disease, including those with symptoms that were too mild to report or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests performed in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which are likely to be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using a variety of methods, including the nasopharyngeal swab or the sputum sample.
The results are usually available in a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus can disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by suction catheter, or a spit (sputting) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 using a reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR) and formed the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK had also developed a test as of January 23, 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical quality SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on January 28, 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronaviruses, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene.In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use authorization from the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products for a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distribute their diagnostic device through RT-PCR in real time of the new 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Agent Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one in three genetic tests obtained inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a bottleneck of tests at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only at that time that federal and local laboratories were authorized to begin screening.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.The U.S. commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of VOCID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed VOCID-19 tests nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been announced. Sample collection and processing must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the VOCID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect the infection with VOCID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA authorization for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing for an apparatus to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted similar authorisation to Holic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA EUA for a test taking about 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to scale up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A literature study in March 2020 concluded that "pulmonary X-rays have low diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of CT can be conclusive even before symptoms develop."
Typical symptoms on TDM include multi-lobary bilateral depolitic glass spaces with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
Subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, albeit less accurate, many of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that "MDT not be used for screening or as a front line test to diagnose VOCID-19."In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population monitoring.Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or by a patient's bedside test (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
The high-speed automated systems of many clinical laboratories are capable of carrying out these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by dermal puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and, therefore, can now distribute their antibody testing.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorisation.At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples within a few hours, which is significantly faster than the viral RNA PCR test.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country were effective enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan whereby suspicious cases can remain at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients spit inside, return it and receive the test results later.The British NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk of a patient infecting others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance when used.As part of the VOCID-19 drive-test for suspicious cases, a health care professional takes a sample by taking appropriate precautions.
The drive centres enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world.In Germany, the National Association of Compulsory Health Insurance Physicians declared on March 2 that it had the ability to perform some 12,000 tests per day in an outpatient setting, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, drive-tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that by calendar week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to week 12/2020 inclusive and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers from Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a sample analysis method for 64 patients at a time, grouping the samples together and testing only if the combined sample proved to be positive.In Wuhan, an improvised 2,000-square-metre emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (in Chinese: "Oeil de feu" in French) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Thanks to its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, the modelling revealed that the cases in Hubei Province would have been 47% higher and that the cost of quarantine would have doubled without this screening capability.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of March 4, 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multixed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for VOCID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without a robot handler of liquids.
In March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagent became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the UK and the US.
This has prompted some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes in order to continue screening.On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now the country testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and is in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of drive-test capability and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Various test formulae targeting different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States.China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and screening recommendations of health professionals.
On the other hand, experts report that the high availability of testing in South Korea has contributed to the reduction of the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization recommended that screening programs be stepped up as a better way to slow down the progress of the VOCID-19 pandemic.The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused hundreds of thousands of tests to be delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "faults."The government then removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the erroneous results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry has stated that it will remove the kits that have given erroneous results, and will replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic have provided false results. Slovakia has purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that have proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested throwing them into the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them." The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by 40 positive test results and tracing of persons who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first death related to VOCID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests with the entire population of about 3,400 people, at about 10 days apart.
Nearly half of those with positive results did not have symptoms, and all cases discovered were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the commune, this measure completely eliminated the new infections.
Thanks to aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened on the scheduled date of the end of the holidays on 23 March.
Several other countries have also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, travel restrictions, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the highest number of tests, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and limited experience of VOCID-19 should send their first five positive samples and ten negative samples of VOCID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in % testing" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that tests only those admitted to hospital will have a positive value in % of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, corresponds to cleaning your hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key times" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by the oro-fecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as flu or cold can be contracted, for example, by omitting to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day: before and after defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing her diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you don't have water or soap in your hand, you can wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing your hands:
before, during and after the preparation of meals;
before and after taking care of a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after mowing or coughing/sneezing;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing your hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of diseases.
The main medical objective of hand washing is to eliminate pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals that may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and the reduction of the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.
According to a study conducted in 2013, improving hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50%.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce episodes of diarrhoea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap reduces episodes of diarrhoea by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). It must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the main IRAs, is the leading cause of mortality among children under five, accounting for nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce deaths due to diarrhoea by almost half and deaths due to acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health measures under the Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common among health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key times of the day to reduce the oro-fecal transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (micure, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing her diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Hands should also be washed properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, including before and after treatment of a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or mowing, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of soap hand cleaning is low.
According to a 2015 study of 54 countries on hand hygiene, an average of 38.7 per cent of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate (97%), the United States was in the middle of the picture (77%) and China had the lowest rate (23%). Today, there are several methods for changing behaviour and democratizing the use of soap for hand washing at key times of the day. Among other things, it is possible in developing countries to offer school children to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day so that children can make this a habit.
For example, the Philipinne Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote child health and education.
Two times a year, combined with daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with a fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To better remove microorganisms present on the skin, soaps or detergents should be added to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleanser for the skin, since lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
An adequate water flow, however, facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, may contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nevertheless states that "liquid soap vending machines are preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly recommended to those concerned with their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can be used to target antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not the result of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, with antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Hot water used to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm and soapy water is more efficient than cold and soapy water to remove natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of lukewarm water does not contribute to reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand disinfectant or antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, antiseptic hand solutions or hand disinfectants) began to popularize.
Most are formulated with isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) to obtain a gel, or with a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5, log equivalent to a reduction of 35 decibels) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.99% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application.The hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus viruses (or Norwalk), the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis.A sufficient amount of hand disinfectant or hydro-alcoholic solution should be used to moisten or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be fronted for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or dry gel.
It is also necessary to clean the tips of the fingers by rubbing them, palm to palm.The American Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than the use of hydro-alcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and their rapid removal activity from microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have water and soap at your fingertips.
Frequent use of hydro-alcoholic solutions may result in skin drying if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and/or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydro-alcoholic solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydro-alcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydro-alcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than washing hands with water and soap.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter on the hands, but only disinfect them.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants depends heavily on the ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have had long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
In low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, but rather use ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less than soap.
Moreover, if the soil or ashes are contaminated by microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than curb it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when it is not available.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands properly to prevent disease transmission by following the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold running water.
Current water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make a difference).
Sprinkle a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The rub action creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rub longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinsing in a stagnant pool of water can lead to hand recontamination.
Dry with a clean towel or in the open air.
Wet and wet hands are more easily recontaminated.The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, spaces between the fingers and the underside of the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can house microorganisms.
A moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin promotes skin lesions that may increase the risk of infection transmission.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to handwashing when tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pour water from a can or gourd suspended and drilled and/or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a pitcher suspended with a rope, and a pedal allowing to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a loaf of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry your hands in public toilets is a debate.
More and more research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper toll industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (London) to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and more modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands in hot air hand dryers, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and by 254% on the palms.
Drying with air jet hand dryers resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the pulp of the fingers and up to 77% on the palms.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other users of the toilets and the environment of the toilets according to each drying method.
The air-jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the apparatus at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and apparatus and potentially contaminate other users of the toilets as well as the environment of the toilets in a perimeter of up to 2 meters.
Using a hot air hand dryer, microorganisms can be diffused at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of hand drying were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following variations in bacterial counts were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydro-alcoholic solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became compulsory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing diseases in hospitals.
There are electronic devices that emit reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, it is possible to use a hairbrush to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel must be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid recontaminating your hands to contact the surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that insufficient hand-cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical facilities, with a large number of physicians and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, thereby promoting the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing one's hands properly and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing one's hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization are also available on the website for feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercially available devices can measure and certify hand hygiene if compliance is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood/biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After having had contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap (soap "pharmaceutical" or "antimicrobial") gives the hand-washing agent an action of destruction of the germs.
It is desirable to remove these germs before performing surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are very common. To "float" your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile tool to clean under your nails.
All jewelry must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash hands and forearms up to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
There is no need to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once the hands have been washed, it is necessary to dry your hands with sterile linen and to put on a surgical cascade.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increasing the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with ordinary soap with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average duration of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products to reduce influenza A (H1N1) and Clostridium difficult spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible to train staff in hand washing, to make more alcohol-based products available to them and to send them written and verbal reminders on this subject.
Further research is needed to identify the most effective interventions in different health structures.
In developing countries, soap hand washing is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool for maintaining health or even feeding properly.
However, because of the lack of reliable water points, soap or hand washing facilities at home, at school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene habits.
For example, in most rural Africa, it is rare to find hand-washing taps near private or public toilets, despite the existence of economic options for building hand-washing stations.
However, low levels of hand washing may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting soap hand washing and raising awareness can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap washing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
In order to achieve this, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies revealed that local approaches are effective in increasing the rate of hand washing in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective; with regard to promoting hand washing in schools, the example of UNICEF's "three-star approach", which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that aims to fuel behaviour change.Following the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates handwashing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of years of healthy life earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of soap hand washing is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as mothers who have recently given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to the fetid smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote more actively hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the pandemic of VOCID-19 in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries of the need to wash hands with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand-washing techniques" have been placed next to sinks in public toilets and toilets in office buildings and airports.
The expression "washing hands" refers to a person's refusal to take responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
It came from a Bible verse in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, a symbol of her bad conscience in view of the crimes she had committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some people, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and value hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienical and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash their hands, is part of the rituals of hand washing put forward in many religions, including Baha'ism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual ablution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in Judaism, the sink in Christianity and the wadhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is mandatory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Similarly, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing their hands before and after each meal.
Occupational risk checks for VOCID-19
Workplace risk controls for VOCID-19 refer to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to infection with VOCID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other employees, in which case only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labeling, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium-risk jobs include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known VOCID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of encounter with a person with VOCID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 as having a high risk of exposure, moving to a very high risk if they carry out aerosol-producing procedures or sampling or handling of individuals with suspected or known VOCID-19.
The appropriate risk checks for these workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and task-appropriate personal protective equipment.
Epidemics of VOCID-19 can have several effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have fallen ill, need to take care of others, or fear possible exposure.
Business models may change, both in terms of the goods requested and the means to acquire them (e.g. shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by VOCID-19 may be discontinued. A plan for the preparation and response of infectious diseases can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors related to the family and community context, and individual risk factors of workers such as advanced age or chronic pathologies.
They also outline the controls needed to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations likely to occur following epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of responding to an epidemic include reducing transmission among staff, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining commercial operations and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms an overall framework for occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls by efficiency.
Where the risks of VOCID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Technical checks involve the isolation of employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers and may be the most cost-effective solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than technical and administrative controls, but may help to prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the worker's risk, properly adapted as required (e.g., respiratory masks), properly and systematically worn, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as required, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), lower-risk jobs have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, the respiratory label, including covering their mouth and nose to cough and sneeze, providing handkerchiefs and garbage, preparing for telework or staggered hours of work as required, deterring workers from using the tools and equipment of others, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious people is a crucial step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrifuges or other symptom-related medications, and that they provide flexible sick leave policies, allow employees to stay at home to take care of a sick family member, and inform employees of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at medium risk of exposure include those that require frequent or close contact, within six feet (1.8 m), of persons without suspected or known VOCID-19 but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently travelled internationally to an area with widespread transmission of VOCID-19.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, particularly in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communications, setting up staggered working hours, interrupting non-essential travel to areas with active VOCID-19 epidemics, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to address workers' concerns, providing workers with up-to-date information and training on VOCID-19 risk factors and protective behaviours, training workers who need to use protective equipment and clothing, provision of resources and a work area task, providing workers with access to a job area, providing access to a job area, providing workers with access to a personal protective device or a personal protective device.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use breathing masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include: separating the patient from the others by a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to look after the patient and offering a protective mask to the patient or asking him or her to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when caring for a sick passenger or touching body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items shall be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces shall be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk controls shall include the postponement of the voyage in the event of illness as well as self-insulation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if fever or other symptoms are developed once on board.
Ideally, a medical follow-up must take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and childcare institutions, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection purposes if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In cases of minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as the cancellation of educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals in the canteen, increasing the space between offices, staggering arrival and outing times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays can be envisaged. For law enforcement officers who perform routine daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with suspected or confirmed VOCID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including the wearing of adequate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt before re-use using a household laundry or detergent spray and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA regards certain health and funeral workers as belonging to categories of high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known VOCID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exposure if they carry out procedures producing aerosols or taking or handling patient samples with suspected or known VOCID-19.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
Funeral jobs with high risk of exposure include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with suspected or known VOCID-19 at the time of death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls of these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with suspected or known VOCID-19, including when carrying out aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in certain health and funeral settings.
Samples must be handled using level 3 biological safety precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on suspicion of VOCID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends breathing masks for people working less than 6 feet from patients with suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, N95 filter breathing masks approved by NIOSH or higher must be used in the context of a comprehensive, written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respiratory masks can provide superior protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as VOCID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than a fluid-borne disease.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask only by screening staff at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, support or transport VOCID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-producing procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective goggles or facial screen, blouse and gloves.
In the event of an aerosol-producing procedure, the surgical mask is replaced by a breathing mask N95 or FFP2.
Since the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a room occupied by a VOCID-19 patient to those directly involved in its care, the use of PPE necessary for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the management of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare for the future
DATE/TIME: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE : CC0 : No rights reserved
This month we are in an exceptional situation.
The VOCID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human interconnection and the responsibilities we have towards each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is based on the kind of empathy, cooperation and community strengthening at the global level that is at the heart of this organization.
The camaraderie and benevolence we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony of the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I cannot be more grateful and proud of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone gave me their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to view Wikipedia right now, and the strong symbol of the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make substantial adjustments to how we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the coming days and months.
During this conversation, we considered what we believe would be an appropriate response to the situation we face and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
We focused on eliminating stress and supporting our long-term mission.
If you need to take a step back, don't worry.
To all staff, contractors and contractors:
our daily working time target will be about 4 hours per day, 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shop or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply alert your supervisor and help your team review schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive for VOCID-19, please notify Bryan of the T&amp;C Ops department for T&amp;C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary attention from management).
All hourly staff will be paid.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honouring our responsibilities to our subcontractors and fellow hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of his usual hours of work under normal conditions.
This is true if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a means of evacuating their stress from the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your supervisor so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we need to continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Security and Fundraising (among other things) teams perform critical work that may require reinforcement.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for all of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as much to make up for lost time" when the pandemic is over.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now unrealistic.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new goals and timelines as appropriate.
What about the APA (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and daily work time targets, we plan to adjust the delivery schedule for our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to prepare a budget in order to allow employees to focus on the essential work, take care of them and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or wish to see their work schedule reduced in the coming weeks.
This extension significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of next steps upon confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues based in San Francisco may have been exposed to the VOCID-19 virus.
However, due to caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all areas of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol, which uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork office, which has shared its VOCID-19 protocol with us and all Washington DC-based staff.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration according to San Francisco's advice.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we have also discussed the idea of renting a space in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but could be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who are used to remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and wanted to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider distributing them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send the documentation in advance.
Make videos the standard, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and speaker list, and someone to help take notes (or take collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness refund for snacks.
Join channel #remoties on Slack to talk with your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work within the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all beneficiaries of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our cancellation requests and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized if these objectives were delayed or changed.
Next week, we will issue additional guidance on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief from clarity and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the future, the TRC is working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Stay in touch despite problems related to VOCID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We will take advantage of this moment to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this email, as well as all other essential information related to VOCID-19, on Office Wiki.
The TRC will update these pages and gather all information at the same location.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, significant workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to prevent and work with the TRC.
We are here to support you and ensure liaison if necessary.
For any confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judah, Director of International Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our work and obligations.
On the contrary, it is a question of recognizing that at present our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we consider necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to offer the world the service on which everyone can rely.
Our planned work will be waiting for us in due course.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps the months ahead.
We need each of you to do this, which is why you need to preserve yourself and take care of your families in order to be able to give the best of yourself when the time comes.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, TRC (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'Angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme is an enzyme related to the external face (cell membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the entry point in the cells of some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a N-termination peptidase M2 domain and a C-termination renal amino acid collectingrin domain.
ACE2 is a type I single-pass membrane protein with an enzymatically active domain on the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is related to the cell membrane primarily to type II lung alveole cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth muscle arterial cells of most organs.
Expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain stem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE clives the hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II vasoconstrictor.
ACE2 in turn clives angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) amino phenylamine at carboxyl termination and hydrolysis in vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also clivate several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apeline, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point in the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes VOCID-19).
Specifically, the binding of the S1 spicule protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ACE2 to the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes within the cells.
This input process also requires the initiation of the S protein by the TMPRSS2 serine host protease, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help control infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies have recommended continuing standard treatment using ACE inhibitors and ARB.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 demonstrated that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control subjects."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less convincing than for the overall risk of pneumonia."
The human recombinant angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme (rhACE2) is viewed as an innovative treatment for severe pulmonary lesions and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the time to action is 30 minutes plus the duration of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for people intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS) or for diseases with high circulation of angiotensin II. Infusion rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
VOCID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate the tracing of contacts in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with the official support of the government in some jurisdictions and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracing the geographic location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an application in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with persons carrying VOCID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local computer community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth app that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering implementing applications on the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a geo-marking application for patients with a diagnosis of VOCID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at Cambridge University, spoke of several possible practical problems related to the use of application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trustworthy organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of control and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the control objectives of VOCID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
Digital surveillance should ensure that there is no exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
protection against abuse and remedies for citizens in cases of abuse should be provided;
"significant participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including that of public health experts and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of continued monitoring by removing the tracking mechanism for their device operating system as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present important potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows privacy to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to trace contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracing information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transactions data, which they then associated with in order to send SMS warnings to potentially infected people.
In addition to the use of this information to alert potential contacts, the government also made location information accessible to the public, which was allowed as a result of the profound changes in laws to protect the confidentiality of information following the outbreak of MERS that affected that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
The details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large volume of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocol and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matches are made on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for using privacy techniques when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of VOCID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. The SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to enable users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alerting applications, a key factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On April 9, 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the release of the BlueTrace protocol source code used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, stating that it would preserve privacy and combine low energy Bluetooth technology with privacy cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools for governments to create formal privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking applications
Direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to solve the problems of adopting the solution and persisting surveillance by initially distributing the system through updates to the operating system and removing it later in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a medicinal product (also referred to as re-orientation, re-orientation, re-orientation or change of therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the conversion of a medicinal product approved for a disease or for a medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is an area of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for VOCID-19.
Other areas of research include the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 and plasma transfusion of convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with several ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites offers the realistic project of developing an effective antiviral drug against VOCID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helicas, protein S, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al. studied several candidate compounds that they then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity with the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would commence on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EUA only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in in-patient patients but cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Physicians reported using this medication "when there are no other options".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Larger studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a test on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have stated that favipiravir is "clearly effective."
35 Shenzhen patients were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 pneumonia patients, half received favipiravir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the medicine is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with VOCID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to procreate.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources for repositioning drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against several filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronaviruses.
An antiviral treatment problem is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early studies before the trial suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate pathology and the other involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing clinical trials on intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with VOCID-19; two against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).
New York State began testing for the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 conversion enzyme, a Phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to recruit from severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine treatment effectiveness.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with moderate symptoms of VOCID-19.
The study called COLCORONA recruits 6,000 adults 40 years of age and older who have been diagnosed positive for VOCID-19 and have moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients and studying the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic assays was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for previous outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of VOCID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as treatments for VOCID-19:
tocilizumab (anti-receptor-IL-6): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
A VOCID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, before at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in the course of a Phase I safety study.
VOCID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic spread around the world in 2020, generating significant investments and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against VOCID-19.
Primary platform targets in Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As stated by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, of which 78 (79 according to the Milken Institute) are confirmed as active and 37 others announced, but with little public information available (presumed during planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial carries out preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and performed in several centres while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine applicants (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (always in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was exploring the potential of a molecular clamped vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On or about January 24, 2020, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it had started working on a vaccine, which is expected to start in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine in collaboration with its biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.
On March 25, the director of the research institute announced that they had finalized the vaccine synthesis and that they were starting the tests.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it had started a vaccine project to create an Ii-Key peptide vaccine against VOCID-19.
They wanted to produce a vaccine candidate that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its vaccine development project.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command in Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both west of Maryland, announced they were working on a vaccine.
On or about March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced its partnership with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced preclinical testing projects and a Phase I clinical trial for July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported developing a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with tests on humans scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "strong sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the VOCID-19 vaccine," which prompted the protest of the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of a mRNA vaccine.
The BNT162 mRNA vaccine candidate is currently in preclinical testing phase with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and that the human test of its final candidate vaccine could start in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemiology Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a vaccine against VOCID-19 including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total CEPI investment in the development of a vaccine against VOCID-19 to US$29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, the Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started testing animals from six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifier RNA vaccine against VOCID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of China sending the sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced funding of C$275 million for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against VOCID-19, including several vaccine applicants in Canadian societies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced a C$192 million allocation for the development of a VOCID-19 vaccine with projects to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that can be used if other outbreaks of coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential vaccine against VOCID-19 in mice, saying that "micronee-administered SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the design of a DNA vaccine candidate in the form of a potential nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate the production of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 virus by the immune system.
In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-hosted computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also referred to as non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 health care professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine using animal models specific to VOCID-19, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for implementation of level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there are no curative or protective vaccines against SARS that have demonstrated both safety and efficacy in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.There is no proven vaccine against MERS.
When MERS spread, it was suggested that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs for MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) had completed Phase I clinical trials in humans and three more were in progress; all vaccines were viral vectors, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications have disseminated a conspiracy theory that the virus behind VOCID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, taste loss and abdominal pain.
The delay between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but can range from two to fourteen days.
While the majority of cases cause moderate symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly during close contact, often by droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
As these droplets are produced at expiration, they usually fall on the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious within the first three days of onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible prior to onset of symptoms and subsequent phases of disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and for their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks by the general public vary, with some authorities not recommending their use, others recommending their use, and others imposing their use.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for VOCID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop influenza symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to consult a doctor immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, nasal discharge or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially had only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for VOCID-19 is usually five to six days, but can range up to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection; reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people infected who do not have symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections found today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Talking loud releases more droplets than talking normal.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient rooms produced viral RNA positive samples.
Certain medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause aerial spread.
Although there are concerns about stool spread, this risk is perceived as low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms develop, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that if it is not yet known exactly how easily the disease spreads, one person usually contaminates two to three more. The virus survives hours or days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and after four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly; soap-based products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, which deactivates and removes it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three people with pneumonia associated with Wuhan's acute respiratory disease outbreak.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in related coronaviruses in nature.
Apart from the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
Lungs are the organs most affected by VOCID-19 because the virus accesses host cells via the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) conversion enzyme, which is the most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicle" (peplomer) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of those admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptom rates are high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and heart function involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units with VOCID-19 infections and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Autopsies of deceased persons of VOCID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for respiratory epithelial cells expressing ACE-2, patients with severe VOCID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, GM-CSF secretory T cells have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory IL6-secreting monocytes and severe pulmonary pathology in patients with VOCID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however, they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to independently develop chain polymerization reaction (CPC) tests to detect infection with the virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (susceptible to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese experience of the test revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
The FDA in the United States approved the first test closest to the patient on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobary bilateral depolitic glass opacities with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of infection.
Under pleural dominance, Crazy Paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Little data are available on microscopic lesions and on the pathophysiology of VOCID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of viral pneumonia severity can be observed:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extended atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia during healing: organization of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIVC); leuco-erythroblast reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with tissue in public places to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected individuals with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groups of people.
Distancing guidelines also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no drugs known to be effective in the prevention of VOCID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected until 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of VOCID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after having been in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having sneezed, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of a disinfectant solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand disinfectants are not available, WHO proposes two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores in alcohol, it is "not an antiseptic active substance for the hands".
Glycerol is added as a humidant.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple facial mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure cases, but its benefits are still being analysed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended to promote immunity.
Supportal treatments can be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients for VOCID-19.
Reactor physicians and pneumonologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for VOCID-19.
With respect to symptoms, some health care professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially under conditions of care when carrying out procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For health care professionals who care for people with VOCID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an Airborne Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions for airborne transmission. The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, breathing masks (face masks) are preferred.
The N95 breathing masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for uses not indicated.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial protection screens, or as a last resort, hand masks.
The majority of cases of VOCID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons with respiratory failure related to VOCID-19 is actively studied for inpatients. There is some evidence that intubation can be avoided by using high-flow nasal cannula or positive double-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether either or both of them generate the same benefits for people in critical condition.
Some physicians prefer to stick to mechanical invasive ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the diffusion of aerosol particles relative to a high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the health care system to deal with a sudden peak in the number of cases of VOCID-19 that are serious enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with VOCID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) during VOCID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control modes and PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of ventilated lung injury and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation appliances.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being tested in clinical trials.
Remedesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed until 2021, several drugs under test are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried in people with severe illness.
WHO has recommended that volunteers participate in testing on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma from convalescent individuals as an experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
He has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate his safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and therefore detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application does not only recommend self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Analytical mass data of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone location and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and people with whom they have been in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was intended to enforce quarantine and protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect people who do not respect quarantine.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile telephone operators that "40 % of people continue to move".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may develop moderately with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of severe VOCID-19 infection based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, however, there is a lack of data for VOCID-19. In some cases, VOCID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, VOCID-19 can progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multi-viscer failure.
Complications associated with VOCID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and heart, kidney and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of cases hospitalized with VOCID-19, with renal impairment observed in 4% of patients in this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with VOCID-19 have high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to ICU had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the average duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem pulmonary samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the lung resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized persons had pre-existing pathologies, and the availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region may also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the mortality rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Under-counting of moderate cases may lead to an over-evaluation of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of VOCID-19 and have a 2.4-fold higher risk of going to intensive care or dying from non-smokers. Concerns were also raised about the long-term consequences of the disease.
Hong Kong hospital administration observed a 20% to 30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This can also lead to post intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection had effective long-term immunity in people cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but cases of people cured of VOCID-19 followed by positive coronavirus tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be worsening of latent infection rather than re-infection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and animal in origin, through the spread of the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by a transmission from man to man.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of VOCID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the first onset of symptoms on December 8, 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO assigned emergency pathological codes CIM-10 U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths of cases of VOCID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidemiological point of view without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death/case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death/case ratio is 6.9% (153,822/240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
This number varies by region. Other measures include the lethality rate (LFR) that reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed with the disease and the rate of infectious lethality (IRF) that reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosed or not) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people infected.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all VOCID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health care system has not been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people can have antibodies, according to a blood donor assessment.
69 deaths (0.04% of the population) were confirmed to be related to VOCID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Human mortality is higher in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at the age of 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, lower prevalence of smoking in women, and male development of co-morbidities such as hypertension at a lower age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men and 72% of those who died of VOCID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government does not collect data associated with the genus of VOCID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "VOCID-19".
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means diease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: December 31, 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes VOCID-19 is called Coronavirus 2 due to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "VOCID-19 virus" and "VOCID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended the use of the 2019-nCov provisional disease names and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of diseases and viruses.
The official names VOCID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on February 11, 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and ventilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup redesigned and printed the required 100 valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of VOCID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is able to spread the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not found evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against VOCID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole-virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response to the human body in case of a new infection with VOCID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the S-spicle protein that helps the virus infiltrate into the ACE 2 receptor.
A third strategy is for nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied to the virus that causes the disease. Antibodies-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved treatments for malaria, including four studies of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs make up the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of candidate vaccines and drugs against VOCID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated in the treatment of VOCID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Provisional data suggest the efficacy of remdesivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassionate remedesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some call for independent analysis of research.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan's virology institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice this dose is highly dangerous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians caring for patients of VOCID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese Guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against VOCID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after evidence of low SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. Studies have shown that the initial spicle protein starting with serine 2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with the ACE 2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of VOCID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at later stages of severe VOCID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is in the process of a national non-randomized phase 2 test in Italy after having shown positive results in people with a severe form of the disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counter such developments that are suspected to cause the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-refractory cytokine release syndrome induced by a different cause, CAR T cells treatment, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of RCT.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems from people who have cured VOCID-19 to people who need it is being studied as a non-vaccination method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action through which passive antibody-based treatment can generate defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from convalescent people, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
