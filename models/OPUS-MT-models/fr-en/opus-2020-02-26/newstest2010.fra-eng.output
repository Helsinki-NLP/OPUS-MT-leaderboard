Barack Obama will be the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The White House leader and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with Norway's King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third who will be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan at the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the present time.
He reinforced the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to stress.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable organizations, but he has not yet decided in concrete terms which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to do so at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not deserve it fully.
He also repeated several times that this is not a price for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an "invitation to act".
A Nature Defender Charged with Blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction project procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and is at risk of up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of South Moravia you come across sorting bins at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you'd have to take a few minutes before you find the right dumpsters.
I don't mean we wouldn't sort the garbage in Brno at all.
But I have the impression that our city councillors, the country's second largest city, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It is a whole science, which requires mainly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found at the moment is the Moravian square in front of Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues don't blame me, but I don't think it's much.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So finally, many of my friends don't sort out their garbage.
Laziness.
It makes them a trot to get to the dumpsters.
I'm not surprised at them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't see any color dumpsters on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing with it.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, right?!
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that shames the city all over the country, instead of buying a few extra dumpsters and offering to sort out more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after dragging for a while on the internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravia region.
Paroubek's budget has taken away money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the government's opinion, farmers or civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When social democrats and communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they relied on the fact that the government would make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just to put the problems back on, to undermine the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest on the borrowed money is increasing and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state doesn't really have a choice where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditure, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those whom the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And afterwards, to their children.
People will receive them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a larger debt of the state - next year there will be no shortage of 163 billion in the caisses, but more.
In spite of Minister Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, the expenses related to interest.
The state will need money to replenish it and it will no longer be enough to increase VAT slightly or to reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
There will also be five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to some groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and started sections whose projects cannot be modified to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping thirty major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to the warning of Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skilfully - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electrical energy), which the State mostly owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no way a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from the ČEZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts or to serve as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GNP according to EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various reparations to the victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save on the department side or, at worst, on the government's budget reserve.
There is also a shortfall of one hundred million in the two-billion-dollar state fund project, which is intended to track on-line the expenditures of each government.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would take place, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personnel and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November of last year and it was made a first demonstration a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is in no way fictional.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, of a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and US operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to devices in 2012.
The shortage of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
The deserted trails are no problem but for the operators of lifts.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and hostels.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all dates in winter, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Internet users travel through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking for the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas," said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info information portal.
If you want to spend the New Year's Eve of your dreams in Špindlerřv Mlýn, don't hesitate too much to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
Hoteliers in Špindler currently offer only one-week stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to place them for a while, but they'll also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease," Jandura estimated.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There's still half of the rooms in our offer, let's say.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last-minute Christmas trips," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer New Year's Eve in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first 14 days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to fall.
Nobody wants to spend the winter in the mountain without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas too will be complete," Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We've got an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few last places for New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is a great interest during the holiday of January Polish and February sells well as well," informs Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázně is also eighty percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Lázně.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent of the current occupation.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest for stays in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again indicated the director of the hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
Hoteliers in the Krkonoše should not, however, expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather should warm up, Jiří Jakubský informs of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition Mother of Wisdom
He even became comical, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, president of the reputation of wise, replicated his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be very simple.
When he finally let his doctrine sweat so eagerly awaited, it turned out that he had copied it with carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the expression "as in Iraq", he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only one that could be so successful that the newspapers at the moment did not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that being said, objectively speaking, he left his successor with a much more favourable final situation than one could expect.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen again
It was again the campaign commanders who called for an increase in the military contingent, including the Afghan Operation Commander, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men in order to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
He succeeded in extracting the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though he originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and complete this whole process within three years. Obama's entire doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same results as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation stands out in the exact opposite - nobody can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing their day-to-day leadership according to what suits them.
The political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only a powder in the eyes behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations.
It is uniquely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the relationship, which is still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick state to act", which is the basic purpose of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is perplexed by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and out of reality can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as the indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning to the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions do not affect the Iranians, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of solving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, each such solution will lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only Russian for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Management of Goldman Sachs Bank will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior management employees of the US bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
The shares can be withdrawn from the directors in case they take too many risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan company
The concern is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs Bank became the target of criticism after setting aside almost $17 billion for premiums over the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total premium amount is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the advent of the financial crisis, the high premiums of the banking sector have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intended to apply a one-time tax of fifty percent to bankers' bonuses in excess of 25,000 pounds.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics
It was five women, a record number, who today in Stockholm received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature from King Charles XVI Gustave of Sweden.
Besides the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak for their research in chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't win this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of fibre optics and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical glasses.
Each winner received the diploma, the Nobel Medal and the certificate of acquisition of the financial reward.
It reaches 10 million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has multiple winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been awarded this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his reward as he was only at the beginning of his journey and was also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy he added that in certain situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Friday morning the Finance Minister Eduard Janota, who weighs his stay to the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that Janota's budget and perhaps his position in the cabinet will be on the agenda of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further deepens the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her position Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be subject to Klaus' signature, it is a deficit of SEK 163 billion that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies approved on Wednesday the proposals of the left with regard to money transfers and increased the salaries of officials, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other, which called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics argue that the budget, as voted by Members, removes the package of savings measures passed by Fischer's government and which, in his view, must stem the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the law on the state budget but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast discussion with entrepreneurs that policies have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irrefrenchable deficit" of public finances.
Now, according to him, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the President.
SDO President Mirek Topolánek said the budget is staggering and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is obviously no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "dirty verdicts".
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is staggering and that it will exceed SEK 200 billion.
On Wednesday already, the ČSSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, the South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus - Undefeated film will expose to the world many things about the country, its struggles and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, plays the film about Nelson Mandela's life, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was a ninety-one-year-old Mandela who asked him to incarnate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him: "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally. "
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama in the middle of boxing has, for example, embodied the leader of a movement against slavery that became himself a slave, a fictional US president, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important for so many people as Mandela is.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his hard work in support of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. President Mandela, who was newly elected, knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role so as to bring it closer to reality," Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it's transmitted, and I feel like I know how you feel, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough rugby environment.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was: 'I look much bigger in the movie'.
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood received positive opinions and is even talking about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety summarized his assessment in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive feedback.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norwegian borders.
The launch, however, was still a failure and the "Bulava" missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, gradually became the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence in rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got damaged in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers speak of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th trial was conducted at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was damage to the aircraft again.
It was obviously the third-stage rocket engine that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be set on fire from a moving and submerged boat.
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time, we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines experienced first-stage failures.
Even though none of the test launches went unheard of, the Department of Defence management considers that only six out of thirteen failed.
This success rate of almost fifty percent fills the generals with optimism and therefore they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetissov signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at age 51
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will be back in a 51-year-old professional game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his team in need of CSKA Moscow and will probably already make his debut in Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is for the time being the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury, we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details on the form, says coach of the club Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the legendary hockey player's comeback will involve only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest professional Russian hockey player.
In NHL, legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a whole season for Hartford and won 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won twice the gold at the Olympic Games, seven World Champion titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as at the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he won tributes also in NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai factory in Nošovice agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency strike on Monday.
The spokesperson Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
However, management wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We can't give up our production plan, it's essential, that's why volunteer overtime was offered on Saturday December 19th knowing there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
Sedmička.cz indicated that the company offered a bonus 400 Czech kroner to employees who would be on Saturday's team.
It will also be awarded posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
According to Vaněk, the company has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the supplement for the extra hours, or they can pose a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holiday season indicated Vaněk.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturdays will receive compensation for the transport costs and for their lunch.
Given the fact that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of the unions as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management took the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory were forced to work almost two extra hours on a daily basis in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the strike after the agreement has been signed.
The next negotiation between the management of the automotive plant and the unions is to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that they were ready to cease the state of strike in the event of agreement on their claims and the signing of a common document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay and so-called hazing conditions.
Management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work extra time to meet the requirements of car production.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also requested that no penalties be imposed on employees who have ceased production.
The unions ask society to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a fee of 5 000 kroner (209 €) for these.
The Hyundai Nošovice automotive plant currently employs 2,000 people.
She started production in series last year in November.
It manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "hard" HIV viruses as well
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new combinations that can slow down the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed drug immunity.
This reality takes precedence in some cases over the fact that the combination does not act as intensively on common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS right now.
However, the lives of patients can be radically extended through a mixture of medications that prevent the spread of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption results in a series of side effects.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which medicines no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assemblage of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all the medicines used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The researchers' work leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on virus proteins.
Metalocarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-wall cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is an HIV virus protein that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease there would be no generation of mature infectious particles of the virus.
If HIV protease is stopped, the spread of the virus in the patient's body will also be stopped, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their papers published in the journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test pieces and on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations to examine further in order to move towards the development of effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína 的ezáčová, Director of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is attacking Fischer, who defends himself.
The President of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the ratified budget for the following year as "severing" and he said Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should call its existence into question.
The Prime Minister described the SDO's words as a drastic verdict.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was obviously no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of government should decide whether to support the minority in the Chamber of Deputies, who is concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the SDO and the Social Democrats with regard to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
On Wednesday, the Chamber of Deputies ratified the budget for 2010, with, however, the proposed amendments of 12 billion kronor included by the left.
The House increased the money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The SDO left the room before the vote, thus following the government's wish that a modified budget is a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Deception and non-utility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will still think about the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office in the event of ratification of the proposed amendments, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment Monday with the Prime Minister after his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the ČSSD, who imposed the changes in the budget, do not have their place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws increasing the deficit, such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the SDO are not involved.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the SDO did nothing to harm them, pointed out Topolánek in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claimed TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas pointed out that if Fischer decides to give his resignation in the face of a fight against the amount of the deficit in public finances, "it is quite logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House. "
That said, he must not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda, so I'll focus on it," said Defence Minister Martin Barták, who was elected to the government by the Democrats from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer flew away in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The SDO turned back at the Prime Minister's request.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the SDO would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not little children, he reacted to the question whether the SDO had not been criticized by the party president in the House or in the country when the budget was being negotiated.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missed.
I already knew when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of everything that was positive, Topolánek responded in person.
According to the new timetables of the ČD there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit from 13 December some of the less loaded express or regional trains and will instead reinforce some of the others.
Total transport coverage will fall by two per cent on the day the new schedules come into force compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including base rates and reduced rates.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a train station pendolino.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest decrease in transport concerns the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can be pleased with an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of a few express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the greatest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distant lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
The ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
This year's bill for the regional railways: an additional SEK 200 million.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay to the Railways next year in a total of 4 billion kroons to pay the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions which will pay for them by a total of 8 billion next year, knowing that the State will participate to the tune of almost 3 billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The Railways have recently signed a ten-year contract, so far the duration was still one year.
The railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not use an increase in the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes will only affect one-day ČD Net tickets and eLiška discount internet tickets.
For travellers without a discount card, the price of ČD Net will increase from 450 to 600 kroons.
The price of eLiška will newly depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single rate of 160 kroner.
Philippine rebels still detain more than 50 people, children released
The rebels today abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some primary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but originally spoke of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels used hostages as human shields during a police flight.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AFP agency, the police initially prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in Maguindanao province in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, as well as his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan lineage.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in the American theaters in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous apartheid fighter came back to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate him.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theatres, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of mind, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He served as President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes as it is presented at a time when South Africa is in full preparation for the football world cup, and because the media are agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority in power.
According to the AP agency, the reactions to the new film are for the moment rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "pavan".
Morgan Freeman, however, is proud of the film by resuming his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for many years and I've prepared myself well.
I also met with Nelson Mandela many times personally to be able - as they say - to recover his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember through the film Mandela's personality and message.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual added.
Wear the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel of the British writer John Carlin being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave his creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his term as president.
Morgan Freeman tried during the film to regroup two racial groups of a long divided population and, as Nelson Mandela in 1995, he was wearing the South African team's national jersey on the lawn of the World Cup, which South Africa had won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in a jersey, which is considered something sacred in South Africa, Mandela had been long ovated fourteen years ago mainly from the white audience and was recognized by the white populations.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in uniting people back into one nation," said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
The South African whites, however, are skeptical as they recently told him in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the region of Louny
A fire swallowed up in the morning a transformer of the Čeps company of the distribution center near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the firefighters of Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokesman of Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
It adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has not known anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
The electricity supply has not been interrupted, says the spokesman of the company ČEZ for the North Bohemian So的a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of the homes, the administrations and the industries was not influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport sets to distribution sets and lines of 4339 kilometres long.
Jančura will file a libel suit against three prefects of the ČSSD
Radim Jančura, owner of the Student Agency, will now file a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic Prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and the Prefect of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
Jančura indicated this in Dvacet minut of Radiožurnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and claim that we are making fine mouths, whereas we have only made an offer for what they want themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways which were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's in exchange for slanders about the Student Agency company, Jančura told Radiožurnál.
Similarly, he indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for this for the European Commission.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's filing of a complaint is the continuation of his media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek.
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he will stop the campaign after Christmas and that he intends to resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in a broad sense.
Jančura started its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of approximately SEK 150 billion, without issuing a tender.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led Jančura to threats from a deputy of ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He ran as a member of the ČSSD, I don't know who he is but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination peak.
The pharmaceutical institute already defines for vaccines the maximum prices that will be paid by health insurance.
Specialists are also clear about the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcus.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If vaccination was started last year or earlier, the following vaccinations will have to be paid for yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the third and fifth months of the child.
Last year already a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal diseases.
Yet parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for one dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Experts estimate that every year health insurance spends DKr 300 to 450,000 in doses of vaccine.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
So far, the State has spent approximately 500,000 kroner per year on all vaccination of children.
Reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear but also serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and poisoning of the blood.
According to hospital surveys, there are as many as 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age caused by pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions on a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
As of January, it must be paid by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský said that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all for the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Srše
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of Pediatricians, recognizes that vaccination based on volunteerism will have its shortcomings.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a reduction in the renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional", says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that as of next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their infants vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakdown because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving them on future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products
This is, however, linked to the concerns of paediatric practitioners, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with the doctors receiving them in the same way as the other vaccine products supplied by the State.
Some Members were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance companies to "reduce the amount of sickness insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for the insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that individual paediatricians will have to invest close to 40.000 kronor per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Flight"
Frank Frazetta's son, a well-known illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars (12 million GBP) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while charging 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the museum into the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81 years old, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan le Barbare and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
AP cited a police official who said that young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, 52-year-old Mr. Frazetta Jr claims to have been allowed by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility", the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied giving such permission, said the agency.
Labour defends the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the increase in the tax and the reductions in spending announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, companies and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor also attracted lightning by attacking low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals, we can see an increase of 1.5% in social insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011.
The Anger of Social Insurance
Trade unions have protested that low wages are penalized by a recession for which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" are pronouncing.
The decline in social insurance - which will make it possible to obtain around GBP 3 billion a year - has made the world of companies angry, because, according to him, it is a tax on jobs while the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL ISSUES OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall even more than the 4.75% expected this year.
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in the company's income tax for small companies has been abandoned
Reduction of taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one person earning GBP 30,000 will lose GBP 90 per year and one person earning GBP 40,000 will lose GBP 190, while one person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn GBP 110 more.
Ministers said that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was "hard decisions" but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would be on the top 5 % of employees.
Stephen Timms, Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "drop of water into the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important and will allow us to divide the deficit by two, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said that he was confident and that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will influence the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - while the debt would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Failed Opportunity"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign against the Labour's "debt crisis" this Thursday, have said that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years is not viable.
Ministers have not been able to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, elucidating "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - to be held in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the Ghost Cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future reductions, contrary to Tory's proposals that would lead to a faster and greater reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems said that the money raised through the increase in taxes and the decrease in spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on wind".
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, said that the announcement schedule - such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Fake budget"
Although ministers did not publish the details of spending beyond 2011, economists stated that it was clear that restrictions on public spending would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures imply substantial reductions in many areas in the future, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This has been a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in the eastern province of Punjab, announced the American embassy in Pakistan, at the BBC.
The FBI said he was investigating whether it was the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges against them are and under what conditions they are being detained," said the spokesman, Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesman, claimed that the agency was aware of the arrests and that she was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Embassy of Pakistan in Washington stated that the men had been arrested in a house belonging to one of them's uncles.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been laid against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, reports Reuters News Agency, but said that the United States must "collaborate more with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuse"
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been less respected than ever, according to Amnesty International's report.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another stated that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticisms are politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens were killed in Iran, after the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors claim that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, claims that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the detention centre in Kahrizak.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"Fake confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of working with Facebook networks and protesting the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in front of my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still in blood and half conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the charges of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who claimed to have been locked in a container with 75 others, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should establish a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The eventPiste in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of Brandon Hill Park, a small springboard preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but it was quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city glittering down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country - real talent," he added.
Awards awarded for the best voltiges - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be abandoned by melting.
Always them and us.
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted to this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for fifteen years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious framework.
He was a good anthropologist and not only wanted to know what politicians and the media were saying about Islam in France, but what was happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslim.
He knows how to listen very well and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that are of concern to the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
The Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today constitute a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Mr Bowen felt that Muslim values and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian so virulent of secularism) were really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a "closeness of key values".
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, expeditions and fishing sail in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
He was familiar with the history and complicated policies of whaling, and described the long tradition of Arctic explorers who demonstrated their ability to hunt the polar bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson, then courageous aspirant of 14 years who had only to fight the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their mother, who had just been killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually one millionth of the surface required for an adult at large.The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often goes back to the threat of hunters to the survival of species.
Although prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Inuit Indians use powerful assault rifles to hunt game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice", Alum Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse of what the future may be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphericists nor oceanographers can accurately report the rate of change.
It's not for lack of a try.
At the end of 19th and early 20th century, the pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen gave the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes below this one.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on the icebergs are of great help, but the bulk of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the brackish water fillets pressed by freezing.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, scheduled between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid wreaths on the graves in Arlington
The 19-year-old De'Angello Robinson first class made a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple crown on a soldier's grave that he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who travelled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the Arlington National Cemetery Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who once were in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place," Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on veterans' graves in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the journey each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the soldiers and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters have also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of the Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York City and on the site of the United Airlines Memorial for Victims of Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second consecutive year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Engulfed in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers chose ancient graves, dating from the First and Second World War, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new graves, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the crowns of fresh pine on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red bow knot on the top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most war veterans in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone, while others leaned to see the small black and white information cards, which were buried in the wet earth for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many crying mothers on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and had driven eight hours to come and gather on the grave of Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long time after I disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government arrested a United States national who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, involve the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an increasing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and is being followed and harassed by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but he has always been denied permission.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of a staff member is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a payday.
On the island, Internet use is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often must communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to Raul Castro's installation as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his sick older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused person is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, at a time when both countries were starting a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposedly preparing a plot to send five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who are scumbling the Internet in search of radicalized young men.
The investigators claimed that they were hunting a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, the home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service representative who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east becoming a haven of terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are interrogated by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential and perhaps more important terrorists, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, US intelligence services have been given priority to infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The recruiters of the organization play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may prove to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are closely investigated by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their propagandary value.
However Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the NEFA Foundation based in the United States, said that terrorist groups must also pay increasing attention, in recent years in choosing the people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than following their recruitment model than so many other people have ever followed?" said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for "action" for the climate
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked through the streets, here on Saturday, demanding more action on the climate from negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On this day when little happened during the climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched around the city, deploying signs in English saying 'There is no planet B' and one in Spanish saying 'The Earth says it has enough'.
Several celebrities have joined the protests, including the Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to her mother's home country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the daunting problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already happening."
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and appeal to leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions," she said.
This is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said that they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passerby who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothing lit several explosives near the main Copenhagen canal, which is surrounded by a few ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some large explosions".
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters did not succeed in awakening the conscience of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued to Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He observed that walking may seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and the various sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test results reveal persistent differences between breeds
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are far more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average results of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview of a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was only reduced to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the rise observed by the Group Director of Educational Institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were propelled by white students who were already good elements.
That would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing," said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a not-for-profit group that defends equality in District education.
I don't jump in joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown (appeared Democrat), a member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4 in Eaton Elementary (Elementary School).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the middle schools in the city desperately need attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools (colleges).
Rhee said the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at pupils in the end-of-the-school and early-school classes who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier into their school career and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (maternal) classes at Grade 6 (6th) focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as they were set up in the District by former manager Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week.
I simply think that we need to continue working to offer better interventions to these students at a lower level than that of the class," said Rhee.
Others believe that the results of NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less success to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teacher trainer at the University of Berkeley, California, who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington's poorest neighbourhoods.
This targeting can also have political repercussions that hinder this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We are focusing on the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendant of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the success gap was the length of the traditional public school, now 180 days in Washington District, to compete with Charter Schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change," said Janey, who came to an agreement with the union of his teachers last year to get 185 days, "that he considers a "start point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise of the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, descends and blinks a moment of eyes at the sight of white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 students (4th) of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of a new student impressed than enthusiast.
Super That's where I'm going to study! exclaimed Graciela who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance to the science building.
Youpi, really? she said dreaming, when she was told the low ratio of law teacher to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully integrated the message: The question is not whether you are going to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands of people who benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one of five "second generation" Hispanics is pursuing high school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, the researchers say, they are paving the way for succeeding generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
The researchers who study the beaters say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at the children of low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them," said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university readiness programs that start when students from low-income families are in middle school (college) and continue until the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the programme has been attended by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 per cent entering university, according to the U.S. Ministry of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry obtains agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put up a bid lost.
Two U.S. companies obtained contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening of Iraq's oil sector surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are opening the way," said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information website on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombardments on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated have restrained US oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
US companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The most important United States companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese National Petroleum Corp., owned by the state, bid more on contracts than other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power," said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected companies to submit bids made bids that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qa'idah was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, having struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, said on Friday US counter-intelligence authorities.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA within Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a member of the Pakistani civilian secret service, speaking on the phone of Miran Shah.
Officials of the authority stated that the suspected local activists rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shredded bodies".
While it was completely impossible for local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, the two anti-terrorist representatives in the United States provided unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaida military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize conspiracies around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks on the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qa'idah leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the United States authority said that Somali had moved forward rapidly in the al-Qaida's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the American public, but it does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies," said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qa'idah character or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of activists in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a not-for-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy for Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, at the end of a tumultuous mandate tainted with allegations of widespread corruption during the United Nations-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure came as the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for the withdrawal of troops that would begin in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview with Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not resigning but would simply respect his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement," said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives claim that Staffan di Mistura was cited as a citizen of Italo-Switzerland who recently presided over a United Nations mission to Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him, in September, of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- who was thanked -- "damaged the mission because there was already a good dose of skepticism with regard to international observation of the elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN leaders to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration at the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that the heavy UN hiring regulations were hampering his ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran needs additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a plot of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week's visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such a outcome. ̈
One of the things that weighs most on me is that if I've learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it's the unpredictable side of the war.
The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said that "a set of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be in less safety with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear programme back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran persists in saying that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for peaceful purposes.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he stated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of his enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran has appeared to have moved away from attempts to agree - in part, the experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my view, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the proposals of the international community for which they had in fact agreed in early October, prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join in what they had not envisaged, in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions".
In a statement made in New York on Thursday, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unsubstantiated allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the rich Kurdish oil region to meet the Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. The US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan regional government: "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq".
We will not abandon you."
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters preaching them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is a grave".
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate in their city and by the ageing population, changed direction radically this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left," said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the only child in China, creating two generations of unique children known with good cheeks and spoiled, nicknamed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and over will explode, from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples must have babies in order to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a labour shortage in the future".
Shanghai is about to become "as old as, but not as rich as, developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's single-child policy is to date, without question, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy risk having to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have assigned the duty of the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the policy of the single child.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007, they softened a lot of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that the central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of retail regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city's government sent family planners and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and slide flyers under their doorsteps.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the Family Planning Officer, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city in the suburbs of Shanghai say they saw an increase in requests for couples' files wishing a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but less than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu of Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly consider the single child policy to be a rights issue," said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of them herself. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone look after us."
We're not used to taking care of anyone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says it more earnestly.
For middle-class couples working together, who lower the birth rate, he said, one must be selfish to succeed.
People 20 or 30 years old grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You have to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you have to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- has returned to the spotlight on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden, in the coming days.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it informed the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are short of time, with over 100 leaders from around the world arriving next week in Copenhagen.
The text, drafted by an ad hoc working group of the United Nations, does not say how much rich countries would give to the poor to withstand global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and emerging new economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of global temperature increase that those responsible would be willing to tolerate.
It gives the process great flexibility, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's Executive Secretary General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture".
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 2020, 25 to 45 per cent from 1990 levels, while the major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union has also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, US Climate Negotiating Representative, rejected any discussion that required the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts of the major emerging economies, if not funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that the Obama administration is getting harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, says Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern commented an hour after China's Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the US lead negotiator either lacked "good sense" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not financially help China to fight global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the world's major powers at stake, defects have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations, while the poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were fighting to find out who would suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It's really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure on them to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that negotiations will lead to at least political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which brings together 43 members, drafted a proposal for a 24-page treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of the climate unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states "were under political pressure on the complete political process", in part because they are now unified and are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, while delegates focused on the fact that they needed to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the Heads of Government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Minister of the Environment of India, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister descended from their aircraft and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and briefings, in order to be able to make claims that would be considered in the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- at which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des congrès every day -- guitar activists present night shows mocking countries that, according to them, betray each other and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 Heads of Government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the court of the greats, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice-president for global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy goods vehicles are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transportation revolution in Great Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km/h, leaving from Ashford, Kent, London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, North and Scotland to London.
The small lost holes will become flourishing suburban cities, the duration of business trips will be much shorter and the passage of the aircraft and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the £10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle and the fears of environmental dangers could slow down British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will deliver its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will present three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y-configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch going west from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems that this will be the best performance option" said a rail professional.
When it's over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour journey currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400 km/h, making the UK network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow 400m long trains that can carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal for 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offers this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to run off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This solution seems to be the best way to ensure a passage from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers repay GBP 75,000 loan for Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the main member of Tory's parliament, had the taxpayer pay thousands of pounds a year to repay the cost of an orange factory he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "maintained", increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension to his second house in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month.
The commons authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a check on members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan stated that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe her as a "veranda for pleasure."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Privileges and Standards Committee regarding his pre-borrowing arrangements.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, following an investigation of his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of the loan of GBP 271.406 from his London property to his constituency home, which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the loan of GBP 75,000.
The standard variable interest rate RBS increased from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim GBP 1.250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as Head of the Ghost Cabinet in September, after a reporter under cover allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
"In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're being treated as "on budget."
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a little bit, based on what was correct.
And I could have asked a lot more, but I didn't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former post as an oil trader, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it appeared that he had asked thousands of books for his garden, before agreeing with the office of the expenses that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a £-shaped hole in Duncan's lawn to protest after it was revealed that he had claimed GBP 4,000 for three years.
When asked about the increase in the loan last night, Mr Duncan said: "It was for crucial improvements, approved both by the fee office and then by Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with stealth or the development or use of the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, by the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn't be clearer or simpler."
Faithful, all come and see Brighton's Advent calendar
Brighton's beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each day of December, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, while visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., each day, with pâtés and hot wine served free of charge.
The Noel songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël", for which the cabin presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar of the beach cabin came just after a conversation with some friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent this through spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for climate
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, both around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police conducted several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, some 100 thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, which was to reach an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish President of the climate conference, the growing mobilisation on climate around the world, illustrated by these events, has helped to make the "political price" of failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the start of the procession, when a group of 300 demonstrators, all dressed in black, broke windows with stones and hammers, one AFP journalist observed.
Anti-riot police immediately intervened untiringly.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Black Blocs, who were the ultra-violent groups, who had demonstrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night "stuck and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold".
Party of Parliament, the procession, rather good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, site of the negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators had come by bus and train from the major cities of Europe, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoat, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue to say: we have time, the Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo said.
There are rivers drying up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators also called for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow's recognition of this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The turnout was 58% a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing President, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr. Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential elections in this region with magnificent landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, gave a warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations," said Alexey Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, in the election criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, as the one transferring to Russia the control over the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, claims that he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: events around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the alert, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of an impressive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Party of Parliament, the procession, generally good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without seeking to enter it.
A scene had been set up to welcome the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the start of the procession, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, entirely dressed in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, a journalist from the AFP observed.
The riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened untiringly, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups, which had shown themselves in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
At the end of the afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We look at extremist groups, warned police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while law enforcement helicopters were flying in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky blue raincoat, had formed a first gathering in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, figure of alterglobalism, told the AFP that he had come to Copenhagen for "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized a number of personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Commissioner for Refugees Mary Robinson, who was to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had launched demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had gone down the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the Philippine capital city hall.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred demonstrators also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, notably in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The history-geo emerges reinforced from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD Sunday that history and geography "reinforced" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education at the senior scientific level.
From now on, first-class students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
According to the minister, "we have to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "S is no longer a scientific field" but "wholesalely, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L programmes cannot remain sub-profiles of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of history-geography at the terminal level in the high schools of technology".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that almost seven in ten French (69%) disagreed with the government's plan to abolish compulsory education in history-geography at the senior S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this abolition, as well as the left and some elected right.
On the other hand, the minister added that there was "no question" of deleting the philosophy of the S terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest the project, which they believe is sacrificing the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2) they will pass at the beginning of the year an eligibility test that will cover their discipline, then at the end of the year an admission test that will cover their ability to teach, explained the minister.
They will also follow internships in situations during the year of M2 and then will be a first year in front of the students as intern teachers.
If you add up all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more presence in front of the students, more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister indicated that he would propose "the individual right to training, something that did not exist in national education".
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012".
At Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince on the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the challenges of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day made up of a series of expert interventions, each of fifteen minutes, filmed and open to the public, observed an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that caught people and made them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo conference, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
Some 20 speakers were selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about the key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphs, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that the auditors will remember that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record".
The videos from these lectures will be posted on the school's website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly rate.
Delays in payments: anger of prison overseers, planned actions
The prison overseer unions called on Friday for "general mobility" to demand the payment of bonuses and overtime by the end of the year, the payment of which was delayed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd union of supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to protest Tuesday morning in front of the penal institutions and "lock them", to "declare theft of their dues".
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general meetings in the various prisons for a strong mobilization", considering "honest and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night, Sunday and public holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for the general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Directorate of Corrections and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime had increased significantly in 2009 and had not all been budgeted, but ensured that the remainder would be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of overseers guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts of staff to operate and modernize our prison system, wrote the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the prison management to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which arises from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours in the future, does not happen again, says Alliot-Marie.
The December pay will therefore be meagre, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, deplored the Ufap/Unsa, for whom "budgetary constraints have good back".
It is a pure scandal, outraged the interregional union FO of Marseille, announcing its decision to boycott until further order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and public holidays if those of October are not regularised in December, idem for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff's money, says the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are worse off than others.
But in any case the account is not there, said Ufap's secretary-general, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "weller things" than the ones he's getting.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first family Christmas at the White House, told the "papesse" of the small Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple gift rule: "I'm giving more fun stuff than the ones I get."
As part of a special show to be broadcast on ABC on Sunday night, the president and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end-of-year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the family's little four-legged companion will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog would "of course" have a present, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama falsely opposed her husband's assertions about the quality of the gifts he receives: "I certainly didn't, I offered you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before he responded humorously by pointing out the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?".
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous host who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favourite gifts as children.
Barack Obama talked about a 10-speed bike, but also about a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my dad coming to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, said the president.
It was only a long time later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had aligned all the furniture against the wall, rather than arrange it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reprocessed, RTL says he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-occurred in Los Angeles due to major "tills" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reworked on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after the American doctors noticed "effects of the operation" of the herniated disc in Paris on 26 November, told his press department in Paris, stating that these injuries had "neededed a restorative operation".
The singer's press service, however, was reassuring that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday would have been plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, RTL adds.
When questioned by the AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain would have been placed after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker was operated at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The procedure, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux , a doctor well known in the artistic community.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, a relative of Johnny Hallyday, estimated on Thursday on RTL that his friend was going through "a bad pass", but assured himself not to make "no worries" for the rocker, which is "a fighter".
He called me right before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was a piece of shit because doing twelve hours of plane after such an operation is not playable," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "endigated".
Mr Camus had also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only increased since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on a "small colon cancer", then a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalisation.
Euro-2009/small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetish distance
On Thursday, Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist at the 2009 World Championships in the Great Basin, won an international title for a distance he particularly loves, the 50m freestyle, during the Euro-2009 in a small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where combinations are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a surge.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swimming and the other two by Russia in relay gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swimming.
A regret for Bousquet, who was standing on the world record of the 50m free, of which he holds the mark in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queens of swimming distance, the 50m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet beat the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world brand (20.30) as he had envisaged.
One can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be prohibited from 1 January.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, during the same competition.
The use of the combinations was not used this time by the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not manage to lower the mark he holds over 400 m free swimming (3:32.77) but nevertheless won by signing the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn't give myself up on this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: Sarcophagus panel that belonged to Zola awarded USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel that belonged in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded on Thursday 1.5 million dollars, well above its estimate, announced the art merchant Sotheby's.
This two-metre-long, 63-cm-high front panel, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "representing four Dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and baccinants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world", explained to the AFP Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice-president of the Art Auction of Roman and Egyptian Antiquity at Sotheby's.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have bid the most so far, said to the AFP a spokesman for Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola dates back a few days.
The sign remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it an element of his bathtub in his Parisian mansion, and with Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly President of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
Remained a shadow zone of about fifty years.
By searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Attempted Aborted Departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico considered on Thursday that the conditions were no longer in place for the transfer to its territory of the fallen president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was denied safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for carrying out this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government aircraft returned to his place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate-General for Migration.
The putschist government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "debate" and apply for political asylum abroad in order to grant him a safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as the invited current head of state.
The putschist government "had another failure in wanting me to give up my office (...), they wanted me to resign," said Mr. Zelaya on Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in Central America.
I can stay here ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Embassy of Mexico has submitted a request for safe driving, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said on Wednesday the Minister of the Interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on the Honduran radio HRN.
I am not seeking asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumours of Mr Zelaya's departure had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the fallen president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their siege.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the putschist government's position.
This demonstrates the marginality of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had come close to Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on 28 June, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled in Costa Rica, he came back by surprise on 21 September and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" whose justice accuses him, according to the putschist government.
The putschist president Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against the return of Mr. Zelaya to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street goes up, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday, with the U.S. trade balance showing the recovery of both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, and the Nasdaq , technologically dominant, from 7.13 points to 2.190.06 points.
The extended index Standard & Poor's 500 awarded it 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1.102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But it remains anecdotal, she tempered, considering that the market focused on "half-full glass".
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The US trade deficit fell in October by 7.6% compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
On the other hand, analysts expected a widening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the main trading partners in the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new unemployment registrations in the United States increased against expectations last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the last four weeks, the average number of new jobseekers "has fallen to the lowest level in a year," said Scott Marcouler of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury Bill increased to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night and the return of the 30-year-old to 4.492% against 4.408% the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of power supporters conspicue "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government looted on Thursday the wives of political detainees gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which some ten dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "Ladies in white", wives or relatives of political prisoners, were conspicuous in the street by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they marched towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, one AFP journalist said.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" chanted, the fist lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plain-clothes agents who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighbourhood of Vedado, about ten dissidents who were also about to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plainclothes police officers, a journalist from AFP observed.
The police forced the dissidents into civilian vehicles, who were looted by government supporters, according to the journalist.
Dissidents' arrests in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organised an unauthorized march to "apply for the release of all political prisoners", to the number of 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a sentence of 20 years in prison.
Mr. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain locked.
The Cuban authorities regard the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" to the pay of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rasily, Cuban television reported on Thursday's protest by pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and freedoms, including expression.
Forced one kills an octagenary with a knife and causes 5 injuries in Clichy-la-Garenne
A forceful armed with two knives killed an octogenary and wounded five other people in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hautes-de-Seine), an hour away from home on Thursday late in the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant was allegedly beaten with two knives and for undetermined reasons, an octogenary, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, was learned from police sources and witnesses.
The old man, who was born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance Police Union, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, about 30 years old, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The days of the other injured are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then had a malaise and was allegedly hospitalized "in shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, always boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He reportedly injured two passers-by, apparently random: a thirty-year-old and a quadrennial, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was wearing on the cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies gathered by the AFP, have tried to control the forcene.
I saw a guy about 30 years old with a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was tough, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Still boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of n°61, two municipal police officers, including their head, tried to summon the armed man and were wounded with fists, according to police sources.
The facts occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passers-by came to tell me there was a person injured outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, some 30 years old, was wounded with a knife.
The arrest of the man without identity papers was carried out by the National Police.
The Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre referred the investigation to the judicial police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The coroner was hospitalized on Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in police custody.
A police source did not rule out his being interned in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the police station in Clichy where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all the forces of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the abandonment of prosecution
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the lawsuits against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a murder case over 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", denounced before three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I demand that the charges be dropped here and now," said Mr. Hummel, "before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back".
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since died -- discussed, before sentencing, with a prosecutor who allegedly told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison -- which is a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "mented" the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled from the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He's never been back in the United States since.
The Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney, Phyllis Asayama, stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to appear at the hearing".
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, Ms. Asayama asked.
For her, the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court, while scorning his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- also pointed out that "there were other alternatives to flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who requested the abandonment of the lawsuits against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, once again called for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client could no longer be harassed at every turnaround in the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends up in no direction, held back by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up undirected on Friday, in a market torn between better indicators than expected in the United States and the increase of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technologically dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve the market's opinion of the robustness of the economic recovery," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
The confidence of U.S. consumers also recovered significantly in December, up from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate of the University of Michigan index.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further increase in the dollar, at the highest level in the last two months against the euro, which "pulls down the sectors sensitive to the economic situation", explained Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill increased to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night and the return of the 30-year-old bond to 4.497% against 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World election again in South Africa
After a month of journey through South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross Saturday's final straight line to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sports or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen many things and lived so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the Southern Summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "the breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Misses now focus on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the steps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both becoming stars of Bollywood.
It is the dream of every woman to be crowned the most beautiful in the world but it is not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, throws Miss India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional costume and of course in swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by a TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a member of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with warmth and pride that it is difficult to match," says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
As last year, the candidates made a safari, visited Soweto's famous township, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I've been with people I never thought I could approach.
I will no doubt return for the 2010 World Championship, enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news is "very positive", assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles where he had to go to his father's bedside hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He's very strong, it's going very well, said to the press David Hallyday when he exited the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13:00 local (21:00 GMT).
The singer's son, relaxed air, assured that he would go "very quickly" to the hospital Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma last night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press department.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be reworked on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife Laeticia went Friday morning to the French high school in Los Angeles where their daughter Jade was educated to attend a school show, observed a photographer of the AFP.
The Head of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery of the Hospital of Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer violently challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated the singer on 26 November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
I've heard about a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus considered that Johnny Hallyday had "departed far too fast for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon".
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and that had stunned me, since I myself had two hernia discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "drainless, without anything" after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic community.
He operated actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practised at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a haematoma following cerebral haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulphurous reputation, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in medical cases, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Doctors' Order, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" pursued "regularly" before the Order Council, and who is "far from being recommendable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention had "perfectly gone well" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems in brackets.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, edlr) as planned, it seems very short," said Mr. Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and sums up the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by the MoDem of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of OPA of the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the ex-Giscardien party, calling on him not to use it on any medium, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after extending his hand to the left.
The defence minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC National Council.
To support his approach, he received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP passed to NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday night, the UDF association's office, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of silence to issue a formal notice to the minister and the MP, ordering them no longer to use the acronym and to pass on to them the property of the brand, under penalty of prosecution.
In recent days, you have multiplied the statements that you were going to propose to your political movement to take over the acronym UDF, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centralist Alliance.
You also thought it was good to have the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, of the slogan +Today's UDF+, followed on your militant material and on your website's guard page, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which calls on the NC to remove "immediately the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the property of (the) mark to its legitimate rights holders".
If you do not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a political movement in its own right since 1978" and recall that Mr Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for three years and to set up an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the mark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but to the UMP.
It takes scandalously and fraudulently advantage of the abscess of depositing the acronym UDF to carry it out on its behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary to plunder it of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear themselves apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010 stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was able to find himself in a state of weakness and at what times.
I think she'll submit to it.
I'll talk to him about it, said at the end of the hearing Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who needs to be protected," he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has brought criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist touch-all, whom she accuses of having taken advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or masters' paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court had to consider the admissibility of Ms.Bettencourt-Meyers' case, lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned out to be a big family unpack on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she claimed to be wary of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Can you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since her marriage."
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again found that the complainant was not admissible, especially since a guardianship judge had refused in recent days to grant her application to initiate legal protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to take legal action, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney, representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The court finally decided that it would decide once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
A managerial revolution or an end to economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been in vain...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of making employees adhere to "values" determined from above as it once was, to impose on consumers products designed by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering markets back at the place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preferences factors returns regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to death demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilisation seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
In fact, EI "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment from employees that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we call for a managerial revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns in the same way as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes, after many detours, to do first... what it has always done.
- Second, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of studies and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "leviers" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr strengthens the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, inappropriate to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a finalist vision of human behaviour.
It consists of integrating, in any reasoning or practice of governance, a fundamental observation: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only studies resulting from the Motivational Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, company managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "at the place".
They thus create a favourable environment for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" is praiseworthy to Obama on the right
The American right welcomed on Friday Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the previous day, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had broached Obama's award on 9 October, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-president in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, said Mrs. Palin, the agry of the right wing of the Republican party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of war "sometimes necessary" in her memoirs that have just been published.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over there, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send an additional 30,000 soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
On some sides, I found this quite historic speech, said Mr. Gingrich, who was interviewed on the radio program "The Takeaway".
The former elected candidate, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and would not be able to award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, George W. Bush's former columnist pen at the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it", said Mr Gerson.
Among the few to the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "ternal, uninspired and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich expressed alarm that Barack Obama was justifying the use of force.
When one envelopes war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, remained praiseful of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely attributed to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the Californian daily inflamed itself.
Obama "made the right speech," the New York Times said, "considering it both dark and uplifting."
Routers: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the strike slogan and the threat to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiceed" this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, started Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions the negotiators had left in the early morning on Friday, hoping to quickly sign the text of the agreement at the end of the morning.
Even if three employers' organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slammed the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11:00 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6:00 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to business" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage earners, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
It's not a big deal, but we're going a long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
We're going to order our activists that there are no blockages, no blockades of the supply centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrants that are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grilllot, President of TLF, praised "a good deal", even though it was "difficult to concede increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and of 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the upgrading of travel costs by 3%, and the maintenance of the general state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will, in particular, address the question of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of EUR 100 million in employers' costs" had been the subject of a governmental amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, which was voted on the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in identical terms".
TLF's signature allows the agreement to apply initially to companies that are members of TLF, and in a second stage to the entire profession, if the Minister of Labour has extended it.
It will take place "as soon as possible", Mr. Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", as the EUR 100 million "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport has forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, deplored the Unostra.
For Otre, the agreement is likely to "deep the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue during the weekend, while a meeting on Friday at the 2nd day of the strike between trade unions and RATP management left them on their hunger as to their premium demand.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10am and 8pm, one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Prefecture, which will force passengers to switch trains.
The Galeries Lafayette, which wait for 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve the department stores".
The RER A crosses from west to east the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains traveled during peak hours, and almost no trainsets in off-peak hours, as planned.
Like Thursday, there was no noise on the docks, as the Francilians organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "one hour and thirty earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of agents and law enforcement agencies.
The RER A operated by SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare train station to reach the metros.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results of a meeting with the management on Friday afternoon, which the unions consider to be "migrates".
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who demand a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP even put its bonus proposals in brackets, outraged the CGT, pointing out that the management "was not done to solve a problem while among the drivers and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a broader review of the conditions of practice of the profession", said RATP.
This also made the trade unions say that the company "makes fun of the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which had so far refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interests of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to expand to the RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Indépendants have given notice.
The unions ask for a bonus of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complain about the deterioration of the working conditions on this line to the million daily travellers.
RER drivers, all in the second part of their careers, receive between 2.200 and 2.700 euros gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in premiums, for staggered hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, with heavy consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-eastern part of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community in an attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "home of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity", said to the press the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to pronounce the dissolution, said Mr.Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, are banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentarians without a label.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "guidelines" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party asserts that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures strengthening its rights, in an attempt to tarnish the Kurds' support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict.
The DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to an increase in tensions in the southeastern Anatolian region, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the justice system was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the great city of the south-east inhabited mainly by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while protesters were throwing molotov cocktails or stones, with slings.
Some 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the decision of the justice system would "deepen despair".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed as a matter of principle to the closure of the parties.
It doesn't solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic openness launched by the government, said political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the head of the road clearing and sanding service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to bother the citizens.
It's just so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them.
And according to the meterologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explains that as soon as he starts snowing on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sand-blasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (named itineraries A).
This includes high-traffic streets, major arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Fire services, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße are also included.
The FES officers begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
In case of need, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road fondue that adheres well, in 3 hours maximum time.
This is why the service of the FES starts at 3am "so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migration begins".
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, we are told by the head of the road clearing and sanding service "because no motorist is willing to let the dirty vehicles pass".
Then, if it no longer snows, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
Secondary lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this still leads to a few complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the walking team of the FES set out to clear the areas deemed dangerous and the passageways as a matter of priority.
As for cycle paths, the services of the FES are generally not able to deal with them.
Mr Braubburger pointed out that there was a special service in Frankfurt to monitor the state of the bridges between 22:00 and 04:30.
As the ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
This special service may also be used by the police if necessary.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: the biped was about 2 metres long for 1.50m high, its hind limbs were strong, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt reports from the University of Texas at Austin and his colleagues in Thursday's Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the land emerging from the supercontinent, the Pangee, and was towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says the discovery of the Tawa sheds new light on the evolution of the early dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
It was in 2006 that Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team tells them that sometimes they find a dozen bones in a day which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating from the Trias.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms the theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named him Tawa from the Indian word Hopi for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms some theories concerning the early evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
Most of the oldest fossils, however, are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians were divided into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaure and the velociraptor which appeared later and descended from the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds with long necks, and those related to them and the herbivores ornithischians of which species such as tritratops and stegosaurus are part.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
The researchers found evidence that the Tawa hallae had small airbags in its bones at the level of the skull, as did the birds that are descendants of the theropods.
These small pockets of air facilitate the breathing of birds relative to mammals.
It appears that in Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small aerial bags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the huge sauropods also had airbags and light bones, it may be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lines were divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e., all the lands that formed the Pangee supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to him.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, advance the researchers.
Alan Turner of the Natural History Museum of New York and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says that there is an even older species, the silesaure, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a misconception because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs have managed to become the dominant tetrapod of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, remains a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Trias the dinosaurs spread all over the planet thus favoring the development of many new species while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Trias and the Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction from which dinosaurs survived randomly while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or, then, dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a favourite meteorite's development of a group of animals which had also developed during the Trias and which since then vegetated in the shadow: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec City, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by the police of the casino at J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt makes waves all over the world.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with protesting students at Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English they condemn the intervention of the police called for by the university's steering committee.
Last week, the President of Werner Müller-Estler University had evacuated buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art were barbed with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories considered that the deterioration did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against the students and teachers who had organised their own courses".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable breach" of freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization go unnoticed.
The Steering Committee of the University has thus avoided the discussions which would be indispensable.
Court officers require that criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Regional Youth Secretary of the Verdi Union.
The Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) took the case for the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the premises is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday on the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests, but let us not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition parliamentary groups SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalise protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Link)
Instead of thinking about the arguments and demands of the students, they are evacuated.
The La Gauche party has tabled a motion calling on the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions for police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret weapons, under strict supervision.
Today, with its 216 000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
Important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics are located there.
As early as September 2008, Zelenograd representatives established links with Riedberg, the site of the Francfortian sciences – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There have been reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg have ratified a "Protocol of Close Collaboration".
The signatories were the deputy mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz project section head for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of IFZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow IFZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies want contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and societies.
There are the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika companies.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills at the heart of which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scope of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed sufficiently high.
For his supporters it is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into desperate chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
The head-of-line stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th-century transport technology that acted as a brake hoof of modern rail traffic because it once took a long time to move the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that's what you have to do.
That is why the head-of-line stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And also in Stuttgart: a train crossing station, which is about halfway on the Trans-European Railway Magistral between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realization of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have not been compatible with reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planners acknowledged that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer pose any real problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and pilot cars at both ends.
However, the Stuttgart 21 project is now being launched alongside the new route of the intercity line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have prevailed.
The railway company is of the part because it is the taxpayer who makes the costs of the risks of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public undertaking.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if we believe the graphs of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the enlargement of the section are designed for a traffic of people which was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time, competition for cheap flights did not yet exist.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic, as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts believe that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junction and congestion points in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the widening of the section across the 180-km Rhine valley.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom in full here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a braking hoof.
The Rhine Valley route is on the way to becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government examines judgment on airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the ban on night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had instructed experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the ban on night flights in the event that the proposed construction of the north-west landing track at Frankfurt airport would take place.
The approval of 17 aircraft between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to appeal the judgement in cassation.
The opposition criticizes this delay and tries to pressure the government representative to have him appeal to the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections to ban night flights. Otherwise, this will be condied as a total failure to speak.
It is quite difficult to be allowed to keep his word," said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's accusations that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights by using "darkness and rubbish".
It takes time to complete a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "rapid first impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its party's statements on the ban on night flights is completely ironed out.
US banks repay aid
The big US banks, which are very affected by the crisis, are breaking their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid to the Treasury $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC indicated during a report that Citigroup was also planning to repay the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched an increase in capital through the sale of securities to investors, which earned it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's caisses, which are well filled through the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Managing Director of the Bank of America, expressly wished to thank US taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capacity by buying the investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also planning to purchase money from the financial markets in order to free itself from state control.
The US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, reported the CNBC channel citing the banking community.
Citigroup's spokesperson did not want to comment on this information.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had repaid their public funds.
Expedited election
In the end, everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German channel ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who leads the Berlin editorship of ZDF, was the great favourite.
However, the channel did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm the intendant of ZDF Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal was not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 Commission members.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors that Nikolaus Brender's contract be extended by five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for Brender's reappointment and 7 others had voted against it. Brender's removal by vote represented a failure, albeit predictable, for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority on the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to renew Brender to his post.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, had organised a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF's news broadcasts had fallen under Brender.
That's why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, smearing the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it would have been useless.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio organ) and Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily national).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (day's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990 he was deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then until 1998 he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (bimonthly news programme presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial board.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialist magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Minister-President of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of political figures from the ZDF supervisory commissions.
Peter Frey, Brender's probable successor had skillfully manipulated the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetical representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a left-wing liberal.
Large cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after one year of educational strike the Länder' Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the weight of the examinations: a single examination should close the chosen study module.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconstituted to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also committed themselves to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At regional level, there must be no different regulation from one Land to another.
Fewer exams
Since the beginning of student protests last June, the Länder' Minister of Education and university rectors have always had in their mouth the fashionable expression "studiability".
But for the first time, this expression seems to have a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to reduce the number of examinations considerably: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination", one can read in a document of about 30 pages on the future conditions for admission to university.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that significantly reducing the burden of examinations should be able to stop slippages, which caused considerable damage to studyability.
"Studyability" should also be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Modules as well as the background must be carefully examined to see if it is not possible to avoid this choking sensation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to allow and encourage personal initiative".
The new regulations will concern access to new university degrees but will also be adapted to existing ones.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory which depend on the accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not too burdened and the examination system was not too strict.
In some Länder universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have given its consent to give more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorial programmes and strengthen teaching guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities are planning a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
In early 2010, the government wanted to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will have to be completed.
The organisation of studies will have to be more flexible, and recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all university cycles should have been examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the question of study conditions in the country.
The decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were made.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like the organisation of educational policy no longer to take place in the future "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the delegates of the conference of rectors (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the student experience is very useful to us", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. He calls for the right and the possibility for each graduate Bachelor to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder assure today's Bachelor students that there will be enough places tomorrow for Master's studies and for the best possible study conditions.
The Länder must therefore hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arriving in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control ..." that a work of poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he teases in troubling phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but lost at the same time his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a professor of German and English in Bucharest and later a collector in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at the Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessen Literature Forum at the Mousonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securityate".
Clearly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the security police.
In 1989 Söllner received the German Language Prize in conjunction with some of the participants.
Insidiously, recruitment trials began in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "so someone who has not been able enough to resist the attempts to intimidate the Security Force."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honoring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary detangles with the mechanisms of the dictatorship's power, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and weakness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assured literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
"He had been able to pull him out of all the difficult situations at the time," Markel said.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is not, in fact, so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securityate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of its own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were last hidden the names of Sorin, Voicu and Walter borrowings.
In contrast to Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of Stasi's files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Security case is still very confused.
Systematic clarification has been constantly thwarted and restrained in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was established to work on the assimilation of the security archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has been rather dragging since then.
Since 2005, there has been a law defining the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great is confirmed by the interview of a former official of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke very disdainfully towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought he could express himself here, without any gene, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inescapable issues are associated with the Söllner case, as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been plundered? The weighted reaction of the listeners, at the confession of Söllner, let us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a feeling of shame.
On the genesis of Herta Müller's work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumults at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, pulled four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new coach VFB Christian Gross went up at midnight minus a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, was led into the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our quinquennial could have taken the wheel himself – he had not had any alcohol and he was not drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
'Cause now it's about to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just engaged three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth of the finals," that is to say in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania" but we must not let ourselves be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is a matter of repeating in Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three quick goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing by lot
The eighth final of the Champions League (game round 16./17. + 23./24 February/ match back 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn by lot on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel's successor's fulminant entry into office was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the one who had brought luck, who had transmitted to the unsettled Stuttgart professionals, a flawless motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they had to concentrate on their assets, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "leader of souls" – Gross – the recipe for success that sounded so well but that no longer had any effect with the carer Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, admitted Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things that we would never have thought possible happen".
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the working method of the new leader: "He is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
That is what we need in the current situation."
But apparently Babbel missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warned manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart mainly needs tenacity.
Just like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had four days later a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0:4 , objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, reported that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still far away.
We haven't passed the difficult course yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to party, even after the first home victory in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a TV interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced right before the game started.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, contradicted Heldt, in response to Lehmann's acerbic criticism.
He had accused management of weak style and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from pubertal fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his free day after the matches had been cut off.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness" instigated Heldt and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They were no longer in danger of becoming friends for the life of these two quadrennials.
In any case, they agreed with everything else, that is, without the previous work of the group by the coach replaced, strong sports and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "to a great extent in success" replied Heldt and Lehmann in chorus – and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavy Duty Championship
Warm fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson challenged him all the time verbally and automatically caused the world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defended his title as World Heavyweight Champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimous consent of the judges, he took precedence over the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as World Heavy Duty Champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point victory at the judges' unaminity against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has honouredly defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the World Champion title of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately he didn't get the KO so long awaited.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional battles, had to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko mainly wanted to dictate the fight, from its height of 2.02 meters, by its left side.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the blows of the champion, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing into play his dangerous right-wing.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, tried mostly to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him "bad zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion couldn't help provoking Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008
After a break of almost four years, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously had to abandon without a fight.
This year, defending his title as champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a shot in this fight and am in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His rève is to try to bring together the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Haye who, having taken away the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, was wearing the WBA belt.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now considering playing this game at the Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz Affair.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (die Linke) ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on Kunduz's aerial attack, the opposition accused the Minister of Defence Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately dissimulating certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a counter-truth" on the deadly hit of two tanker trucks last September, said the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the newscast of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the 8pm newspaper).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was given to the total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report available to NATO, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, Trittin said.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the goal of the strike was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or injured during the American air attack, which was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, Military Commander of Kunduz.
The Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday, to take a decision as soon as possible before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his colleague from the Green Party Renate Künast are of the opinion that Angela Merkel must make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Government and whether the chancery, the army and the intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancery has in no way influenced the army's interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were growing voices to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to information from SPIEGEL, the information they had given to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some embarrassing details from the Minister.
In the circles of the two senior officials, however, it is suggested that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had meanwhile asked in a letter for clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred the matter to the Federal Parliament Board of Inquiry, which was to be established the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dreams
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality are confused.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie down in our dark rooms, we can indulge without hindrance in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, the one who, awakened, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in the mentally ill or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at issue: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but sometimes encourages the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to melt.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and effect are distinguished, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiments of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of the shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, neurotransmitting substances of the brain - in the first place dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusion often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
The Earth's attraction force no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of dream-awakening; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T turns into a cartoon character.
His body is in two dimensions with a loud color.
The Earth's attraction no longer has power over it, it's hovering over the ceiling.
He's feeling a blow.
Behind him winged devil creatures, griming, bloody mouth, showing teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pains throughout the body.
Tonguing, nasty voices scream, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo, makes it a loop and fastens it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The buckle is loosening.
Let it be a lesson to you, cry out the voices in a choir to rip off his eardrum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
Diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, moreover he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers at least once in their life from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner and outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper excitement, which causes them to suffer hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of Heidelberg University (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
The schizophrenic is in the very centre of the situation, all to a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience once in his life a hallucination.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
Delirious thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain make this kind of cabrioles, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what is still unexplained is the way in which the neural system anomaly occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain heats up.
What's crazy, Professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck tells us, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head".
The hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of many other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the brain areas that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently refreshed; when our brain heats but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain injury or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledge having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and goes to high school.
A young girl all to do normal to tell the truth.
If there weren't images and voices.
During recreation, a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, may speak to him.
When she replies her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer, but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young man friendly.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are heavy.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in his eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is obviously explaining equations to the table.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that arrives too rarely and far too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreaming already, if the images she sees, the grim faces or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she shouts to these creatures.
She doesn't talk to her parents or her friends, they think she's crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her baccalaureate last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she came into contact with the psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she's not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is high that they will have hallucinations after a certain time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, so there's animation.
Sarah K., a single daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13, that the man she called dad, since she was of thinking age, was not her real father.
These are the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "is taking place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real."
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our world too consciously focused, unfortunately, we tend to take the imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and doctor head of the psychiatric and psychotherapy clinic at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of the modification of consciousness awakened by the dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreves that are perceived as real by the person who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is in a state of awakening.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who fully consciously experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental boundary between dream and hallucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
Zurich's Peter Cornelius Classen, art historian, also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Changing the Heart" as an action to safeguard the soul.
He is 49 years old, at the time when his consciousness leaves for a journey several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; during this time, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created of all kinds, visits foreign places, travels through time. He sees himself as an old man in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside looking after his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs based on blood.
He is taken by a Greek motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
He completely absorbs himself into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these domestic travels are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
On the contrary of dreams, memories from mental travels are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, the oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of the external reality are even in a state of watch.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist Kasten "may cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over the publishing house.
Kallen's appointment to the position of CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly committed to integrating society, said 69-year-old Hubert Burda at Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will then arise.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
One cannot impose his children on 7,500 collaborators without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of them.
It would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President and Chief Executive Officer as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was primarily responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the lead in marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
Thus, for the first time, it is not a family member who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively, his son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Kallen's appointment also serves to make the link for the next 10 or 15 years"
Burda states that the holding company must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been led by a bulimia of capital, which have made enormous unfortunate speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
That was never my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of the country's preceptor as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on far too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective which seems to have set itself El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, devoted to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist of laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding area, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent for two hours the relaxation area in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" who guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to do our exercise program correctly.
Its director ensures that 15 minutes (heating and stretching included) are enough to get all the muscles of the body to work.
And, if after having made our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the sign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Varied decorations
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important to highlight the silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, owns the electric car
The endesa electric company, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, has created the "Oficina LIVE".
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will set up mobility agreements, carrying out procedures, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVEL project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "Electrical Cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVEL Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
The electrical company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates with regard to the promotion of electric cars.
The company takes part in standardisation groups at European level and is running a series of complementary projects such as the G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquillity" for the motor sector
The President of the government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
At the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"With this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can look forward to a peaceful future for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this connection, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), allocated €800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than €3,000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended for both the development of new models and the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand support measures, referring to the 2000E Plan, which was set up in collaboration with the Autonomous Communities and the automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6 per cent and contributed to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased by "40 per cent" in November.
20,000 m2 of vintage cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Cars Collection Fair, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo de Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
Not only can we find classic motorcycles and cars, but we can also find items of all kinds linked to the world of motor vehicles in ClassicAuto Madrid.
Thus, at the pavilion exhibitors, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of items related to the world of the collection engine that will make collectors and curious people happy.
Among the participating companies, we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and restoration of cars, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sporting exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests will also take place on a circuit outside the exhibition centre with motorbikes and collectors.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sports spirit
Mazda intends to prove that the sports spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated the engine shutdown and start-up system, i-Stop, on the Mazda3, a device which, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150 horsepower petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good rating it has achieved as a whole.
Details, vehicle finishing, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driving station, it turns out that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and attachments.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more particularly the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
By continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large chest with regular shapes.
The automatic shut-off and start system of the engine, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre and 150-hp petrol engine and with manual change of the six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its finesse, low noise, performance and control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most requested Mazda3 are diesel models, those that do not make a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, i.e. the one with the largest number of serial elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (SVR) which removes the blind angle, traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, the rain and light sensor, the bluetooth and the audio bluetooth, as well as the 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly noteworthy.
Moreover, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements bi-xenon adaptable headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is illustrated in particular by the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who don't drive many kilometres a year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horsepower 2.0 petrol engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us a great deal of satisfaction every day.
Luxury "First"
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady".
FonPeek's Promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that allows only to look at its email, without offering the possibility even to see certain types of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of glory in the United States, when Time magazine identified him as one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and a very low monthly subscription, which is less than half of what costs, for example, the iPhone data subscription.
In view of its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, about 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately looking for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a connection from Fon) to be able to view their mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it has been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have done a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders by the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and we're not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it's always curious that it's called Fon when it doesn't have WiFi) offers this type of rate, means that operators start thinking differently and are studying different proposals to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
With no subscription and no pains.
It is a connected device and is paid for when it is purchased and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a purchase option with access to life as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I simply wish it because I believe it is a fairer formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer showing the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
Yellow is, no doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, she chose the same to accompany her in the second, without a doubt, most important moment of her life: the award to Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to their resemblance colour, a yellow drawing towards the green with brilliant reflections, on both occasions, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was decorated with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, at a glance, it would seem that the first lady of the United States followed the Princess of Asturias and chose to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for the taking of office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she wore a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now raised while it was worn the previous time.
75% of working mothers had work problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for young generation women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fécondité et carrière professionnel des femmes en Espagne", carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers had their professional careers limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of couple life and the number of children, whether or not the woman works and the type of employment held.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or have unstable work, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women in stable employment, mainly in the public sector, push back entry into marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after moving in as a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 for those working in the public sector."These data show that women with stable jobs have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to delay the union and arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment that is exercised largely influences maternity, but less the date of the beginning of a common life," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
Educational attainment is another factor that widens the age gap between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference is also maintained among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also emerges between women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary education get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have completed middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child," says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, engulfing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it well".
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, thus joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also includes luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
UK fashion prices
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, designers and models, from yesterday and today, met for the annual presentation of their prize, which took place in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vincent's ace poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
It does not do so according to the foreseeable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The trip is exciting and Vincent spares neither the fears nor the illuminations.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you here a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, that very one I felt without naming: pleasure against fate, morals without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihiliste, an allegorical Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with dazzling poetic humour, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that was to reach heaven by the way of perdition."
On James Joyce: "L'Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the peaks of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers still let go."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir of a county landowner and other times that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great."
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer gathered the loud cry from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking posteriority with a violent speech to the asticots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, "Beloved God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ rest after the war,/ after life, tired death delighted."
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband very normally agreed to tell her that Edward VII was watching her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
One has never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent exceeds madness."
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it was not to try to hide Joyce at Baroja?
What does Benet try if it's not to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did This do except to aspire the glory of this man to serve him as a pedestal?"
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years of age passed next to her and our dog, a blood-mele, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked her two times that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we do not see what is amusing to attack for free a small helpless animal who was also on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energist who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday like another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the district police station, even though we doubt that this is of great use and not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly murderers were Spanish.
Indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it fun to mistreat a defenseless animal for free, giving us affection, friendship and keeping us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, set for wearing helmets
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of helmets, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as the two structures have indicated today.
The objective of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing the helmet, since it is the only protective element to avoid head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin indicated that this campaign is in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safe products" and affirmed that it contributes to this objective through other educational and informative activities.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be", will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a tyre manufacturer for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safe products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the Anfac and Ganvam manufacturers' employers' union, that of the dealers.
The good news, however, should be nuanced, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, the registrations accumulated during those 11 months were 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, adding all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (passenger car derivatives, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) 95,853 have been sold.
The large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, because, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external funding.
Thus, in addition to the restrictions involved in limiting bank loans, other factors must be added, such as the rise in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
In the face of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid was used little.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions which does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre, can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The dealership association plans a year similar to the year that ends, for which it calculates a decline in sales (of passenger vehicles and of 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking aid is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock brake system and as this will take place with the ESP stability check, emergency brake support systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen the protection of pedestrians, although, by its mode of action, it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kicking given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident could not press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of its strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, revanced, required the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance the car needed to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of element, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are involved could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four accidents with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts the maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors rejects the plan for Opel until January
While the workers of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Saragosse) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th – according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he will need more time to conclude Opel's emergency plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, intends that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made within the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as quickly as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is becoming more important.
In the event that there is no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to thin it with less than 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to pass, in the first place, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual stashed roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminum doors like those of GT3, 15 other kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilos of winnings, to mount sports bins, still 12 kilos, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning another six kilograms and replacing door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK, the test was performed on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on roads in the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behaviour can only be described as irreproachable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from riding on the floor with a plumb.
On the contrary: it's been a long time since we tested such a small and lightweight model that at the same time guarantees as much safety in the corners, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of heating his muscles at low speed for the time needed, until we ask him to sprint, brake, recover and push his motor again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the steering wheel.
And she'll do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or with a system that modifies the roaring of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, either at a standstill or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The road cover we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car managed the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely noticed their presence throughout the journey, while on some bends we found ice in the early morning and gravel later in the morning.
In the end, an ultralight car, most entertaining to drive and much more than just a change in the Boxster S.
The car will be available for sale in February 2010 at a price of 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the parades of the house, the singer displays her face as bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a Bad Girl or a It Girl, it's a Bag Girl.
Baskonia Wins Israel · Global Voices
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during his visit to the arduous field of Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous absences suffered by the Dusko Ivanovic team. She is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets at three points was the best of his team (29 of evaluation).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, even though they had to wait until the end to win.
Moreover, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter, suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with the warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but the Alava team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with cheers and applause back to his old house, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already getting noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" already suggested that this night wasn't going to be the best in Brazil.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that it was not so easy to win on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in ensuring that the yellows took the advantage over the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to get the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun came up, which, with three baskets with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas gave the meter a reassuring score (54-67), and that the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play for all in the last period, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not tire of taking what they had deserved for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the line of three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis got closer in the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The wounds prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympiacos and gave him the lead in Euroligue Group B, in a match marked by the absences of Unicaja players, especially in the inner game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere of the Peace and Friendship Pavilion or the size of the rival, no doubt one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Scortsanitis, allowed to reverse the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fight, between the North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal mistakes weighed on the Unicaja.
The inner players and the Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage at the nineteenth minute.
An impossible climb
The third period was particularly offensive for the Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to match the difference of the match in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the lead of the group to be shaken.
The Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, gave a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible because the Olympiacos was relentless when the players put pressure and showed their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid according to your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of classified real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates user salaries from more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the application has been working, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker "feels ill-paid", explained in a press release the Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A UK computer programmer receives 45 226 euros gross per year and a French programmer 31 059, while a Spanish programmer receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, one driver receives 34,247 gross euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well paid job in Spain is that of a server, with 11,592 euros net per year, followed by that of a seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are driver, part-time and social worker jobs.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president will have to abandon the diplomatic legation by 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his mandate.
Francisco Catunda, business officer of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since 21 September, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on 27 January, at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination."
The channel also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention that leaving the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile which the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you so much.
After pink days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant in the markets, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been virtually finalized and, without calling into question their non-conformist liquidity policy, are beginning to put some sand in the workings, as the ECB has done, with their one-year auction next week.
As a result, investors are doubting the ability of the global economy to maintain an economic recovery without heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond spreads are increasing again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Once again, there has been a shift towards quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the investors' refuges, provoking an increase in the differences between euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the advocates of moral risk, who were trying once again to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for world economic policy who had slowed down the destructive effects of credit limitation on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to decree a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the emirs to restore its place in power in the emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the rose pot.
Prodi did so in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What is logical, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and made its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt gaps increase to the extent of European corporate bonds, we do not have to worry.
If European differences were to decrease and ours continued to increase, this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their 2011 forecasts upwards, together with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to the burden with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not augurs much hope for their warning.
Again, this seems to be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment "precaution is mother of surety".
Connected sectors
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday in front of the Sub-Committee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the sub-committee, eight-closure.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and another 60 000 million between that date and 2030, if the nuclear power plants now in operation remain open.
If this were not the case, the necessary investment would not amount to 60,000 million but to 95,000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
Starting in 2020, the issue is changing, and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18 000 MW is needed, along with other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Act that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is demanding, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "one-off" measures, as the President of Iberdrola called them.
In any event, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, should start to be taken, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance foresees an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona fights her first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for her first concessional highway in Australia, a market in which she already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is an estimated tunnel of A$ 1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5-kilometre-long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The town hall of the city wants to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the public/private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Ernst & Young, the local administration already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the planned investment amounts to A$ 1,700 million (approximately EUR 1,047 million) and in the final phase there are three consortia, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish smooth company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first one is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second one, based in Italy, is one of the largest European experts in underground work.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was formed, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that has passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (ownership of the German group Bilfinger Berger) and Welsh company specializing in public works, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatisations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy that has been followed by the already mentioned Hochtief and Bilfinger companies, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the sector of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalinator, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and the so-called Northern Link (northbound link), is expected to connect the western Toowong highway to the peripheral track at Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The schedule set by the administration indicates that the auction will take place in the summer of 2010 and that work will begin in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll track will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of a two-way system, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide A$500 million (€308 million) for its financing.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief grow widely, which yesterday mentioned the obtaining of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed network with fibre optics.
This will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has concluded the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC is given a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has been given the opportunity to build a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia, amounting to €64.5 million.
The company obtained this contract a few days after having been given responsibility for the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates his experience in tunnel construction.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore gets addicted to Renfe's advert
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that came to Renfe's call for tender, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, who has been responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator fined France Télécom €63 million for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region of the country.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony through the signing of exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it places on its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was also increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An application shop
On the other hand, the French company's mobile telephone subsidiary followed other operators and opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that did not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange's App Shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will take until 2010 to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of revenue for clubs since its birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place among the clubs that have taken the most money in this competition.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the major clubs.
Indeed, the competition has allocated €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have participated in the event since the creation of the tournament, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The White Club was the third in the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, had won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are the Manchester United and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams which, in addition, charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, in terms of the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox can be explained by the complex method of distributing money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification matches (among which the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match played.
There is also a bonus in the event of a win (€800,000) and a tie (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth of the final get three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter of the final receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
For example, for fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça won $2.5 million for winning the Super Cup of Europe in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which there are 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the largest, with four slots.
The previous year's champion took 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other game will be paid based on the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the stock offer by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of Sos' capital.
A percentage that does not require it to issue a public bid for acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be disbursed in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this deferral.
Yesterday, Sos' shares ended at 1.85 euros; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore estimates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of EUR 1.50 reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez group gives a period of 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If this were to happen, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while Sos's capital was 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay out of the possibility of buying and going to court from its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Internal Audit Director.
A decision that made him the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free from controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar societies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos reveals new embezzlements of funds cannot be ruled out.
On credit to the Salazars, former Councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the diversion of 212 million without knowing the destination.
CNMV authorizes Paternina's exclusion OPA submitted by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorised the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The oversight agency explained that it authorized this transaction because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory sheet presented to be "sufficient" as a result of the amendments implemented on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
He also explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed, and that they could not in any way be transmitted before the offer was finalised, which he stated was the price fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the existing standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each disaster is different, and the calculation of coin costs and labour time can be a long and complex work.
To calculate by hand the cost of a repair between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including coins and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the most recent computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of system.
Providers of disaster assessment and maintenance services and solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
The other competing companies in the field of assessment tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, so that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies start to work.
This is a very difficult task, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model can be clicked on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready within a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-sale car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, for example, they have information about Porsches, but not the Ferraris or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99 per cent.
To carry out the documentation and database development work, Audatex has eight centres throughout the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), each of which specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than one hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million annually to develop these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing the breakage parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide that provides information on the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it does it in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard disaster assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, at most ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which performs thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to bid on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or knowing the common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a given brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious losses for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of disaster assessment, breakdown or car maintenance services and solutions.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product in the marketplace.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its volume of cases has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the last three years, and it reached a turnover of 10.8 million euros in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, it began its internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
The Solera Group's global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% higher than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, Solera Group was listed on the stock exchange at $1,000 million, and today its shares are valued at $2,400 million.
Since 2007, he has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark.
Internet auctions of injured cars
Last October, Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing a huge international market.
This estimate and sales service is intended exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, breakouts and professional sellers, who must be registered before they start carrying out transactions.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads a day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
In accordance with Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed may no longer be used, but certain parts which are not damaged may be used as replacement parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex procedures.
Four-step garage quote
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are resisting the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, surcharges or discounts, then he can print the quote to deliver it to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
At present, Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
