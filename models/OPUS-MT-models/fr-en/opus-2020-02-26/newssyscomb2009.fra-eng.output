Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought about a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a well-known strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly large losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the vote, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the vote.
The ÖVP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the vote, has ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties, particularly for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Again in early July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
Voters visibly chastise them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculations were made about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the extraordinary party leadership council.
Such an evolution would a priori facilitate the path towards the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ split) on a common government, which even raised sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently relies on this development.
The last party to have access to the parliament being the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell back, among the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth position.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegally collecting cockroaches could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said there would be a certain cooling down of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, on leaving the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was relieved of the charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could apply for bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same direction also during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide convicts with "competent legal support", said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance was already being provided by India.
"We want above all to keep with India the best relations, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We consider the imprisonment and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great contempt," he said.
The minister avoided the question if he had obtained the promise of India to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said only.
A Czech Arbitrator Fighting for the Seabed
It is approaching a mural electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seafloor.
This area is as large as the continent itself," said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardour at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world not so far known, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms for the time being unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A larger bottom than the land
The littoral states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed using their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is known as the continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Convention, the latter may claim exclusively all the resources of the continental Shelf.
"To simplify, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered to be continental Shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent the so-called exclusive economic yone," says Mikulka.
The request made by the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on numerous prospecting and costly metricities.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Committee with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
So far, the committee has dealt with five requests, namely those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," says Mikulka.
Australia's success, which was the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a worldwide resounding.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the depth of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the Commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, representing the country's sixfold increase.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There, no State enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nevertheless, let us not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "its areas are precisely clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states in the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the "Interoceanmetal" joint organisation.
In 1991, the Commission obtained the status of the so-called "first-time investor" under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states.
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is enlivened, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a polymetallic concretion-rich deposit containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, brings an example of such a concretion.
It recalls a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German Special Forces were on site for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had asked for Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to information from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both specialists in the Federal Army and GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Flight and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk were at the site of the liberation.
As the spokesman for the Ministries communicated on Monday evening, the German forces were not finally required, as the hostage-takers had released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the ground as a support force.
"It has fortunately not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The aggressors had abducted in southern Egypt the group of tourists made up of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have meanwhile arrived safe and sound in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the released hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the release details.
In Berlin for the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five holidaymakers and the special forces should have taken off on board an Airbus of the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
United States House of Representatives Refuses Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress recently failed the $700 billion capital market bailout plan.
The Dow Jones fell into the abyss.
By 227 votes to 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan for the government's financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and politicians leading the two parties, the programme that was to curb the chaos of the financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the parties had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded 700 billion dollar plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a favourable vote, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for the avoidance of something that has not yet happened," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones dropped by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of the investors that the state rescue plan could overturn.
It came up shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now planning further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are necessary.
Organizers report an increasing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the next few months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 per cent.
Despite weak economic prospects, Germans' thirst for travel remains insatiable according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded sales of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing booking figures already dominate the autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have increased to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, confided to the RVD.
The sources of these results are the GfK, which analyses monthly booking data for 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low price of the dollar, travel to the US would be particularly demanded, DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about a Third Party.
Apart from this, Spain, Turkey and Greece and our country would be destinations particularly sought by Germans.
Specially organized trips are very much in demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs here would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individual tour".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, explained Laepple.
The summer months have also been very popular so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who undertook a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Party
The hits of Ballermann or Après-Ski continuously, beer in pitchers a liter and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She's a blonde, television animator and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer festival, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this at my first visit to the beer festival.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Thérèse Square, everything is half as much worse.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one looks blazed or affected with shame - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume gets some weird eyes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian woman points out that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "to the left means free, to the virgin middle, to the right, to the widow's back."
Discreetly, I'm cheating my buckle from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughs.
Others don't put up so much trouble for these subtle flirt techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get trained!" and exposes their naked rear-train without being invited.
The young man with an exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, arrives from England and comes for the first time at the beer festival.
He thinks it's "gorgeous," with a "ooooo" lying down.
He tells me all this after getting relieved of the cup he had been drinking before.
Right next to that fire hydrant everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild peasers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers' ribambels run to the party square and have to look after the poor drinkers.
The nurses tend to intervene in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents.
That's how it works for most beer party visitors: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who rest in the coffin of drunks under the tarpaulin are not visible.
"They're the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," shouts one of the first responders in response to my question and then disappears into the fray.
Accident victim identified by police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but later died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released since then, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps away from Asia, is one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we have no doubt as to the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, which is lagging behind in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway which arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the cold borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and the empire forces went beyond Egypt and pushed the Turkish and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say this is sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, swallowed up in the meanderings of history.
But today, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, serves, at least symbolically, to underline the widening of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, caused by the cold borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of engagement.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a sleeping car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, shook on noisy tracks, the pace of which was reminiscent of the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new age, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing area, surrounded by half-built shopping centres and numerous pastries in which mid-managers in suit-dress-men and women- meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"the purpose of this foreign policy is to now reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly," he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with both of them.
She had to do both.
"But now, at some point, I asked if Turkey should not choose?".
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost all those with whom I have been able to speak, recited to me by heart: The Turkish railway not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, that is, as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the tracks to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleeping, I thought about the two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in Turkey's hands.
While waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe".
At least there is no longer any doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was to include those under 21 years of age, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and to his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod told us to "let music speak for itself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in the music.
So sing!"
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, he raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver were to be named knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982 when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me- and, a few times, they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had such a rare combination of grandeur and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focus only on certain people".
He'll be missed by many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Hopslon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
This is what comes from the letter of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Neb End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time finished a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hops, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resino's exhibition " Flamenco and Life" because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second assault on Honda's super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To this is added a few refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more fuel.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So it's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz presents a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them are innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation was placed on the market.
First of all, it is observed that Honda renovated this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most popular car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Specifically in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it expects to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% sales growth in the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The Spanish subsidiary hopes to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the company's managers hope to finish the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease in sales of 16%.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a market share of 2% in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
It is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Based on the markets and estimated by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be divided between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is expected in the first three months of next year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (plus five centimetres), its width 1.69 metres (plus two centimetres) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, representing an increase of five centimetres.
On the other hand, the height does not change to 1.52 metres.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity than the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the 1.2L Honda Jazz trunk is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improving access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2-litre and 1.4-litre gasoline thrusters.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous thruster, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reached 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has, this time, been inspired by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating bee theft, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of Brand Management, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During its flight, each bee creates its own personal space of an oval shape that looks a lot like the Nissan security shield.
But the most important thing is the eyes composed of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a Laser Range Finder.
It detects obstacles that are located over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"As it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If so, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, " explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Moving Laboratory and principal engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotational function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
" Each second this device must only process information and act on it.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logics of prior maneuvers, that's why it can work continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we're not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes."
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognised that the United States Treasury, apart from having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
In the face of the crisis, and in order to prevent the Americans from embarking on mortgages with the solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is to say 'the Hotel of bad credits' ... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if this is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is sure that this game gives useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley Opens Capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay $9 billion to take up 21% of its capital, a new one hosted by a sharp drop in its stock market price.
A week after announcing an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG was going to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price withheld is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional US$6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a 10% return and a conversion price of US$31.25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 5:00 p.m. GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to bank holding status," said John Mack, the US Group's Managing Director.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which is intended to allow him to diversify his activities but to bring him under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis has forced Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago," said Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, MUFG's Executive Director, "we thought the stake would be made up entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into common shares in one year if they exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, i.e. approximately $47, over a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will allow him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "net" eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock market price melt by half while the cost of insurance against default risk on its debt was flying away.
This cost increased Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced that it raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, it was the third that put a draft new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" obtained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were blank votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half the vote plus one.
On Sunday, two polls on the way out of the polling stations and a count from a non-governmental organization had announced a large victory for the "yes", setting it at between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft Constitution on the night of Sunday until Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly", he had assured, congratulating the Equatorians at the siege of Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales as well as his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in a calm manner according to the observer mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was about a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country essentially living from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign exchange sent by its emigrants.
The project, which was carried out by Correa, elected in 2006, also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will be able to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he would use this power and run for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services which the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the abductors of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday afternoon safe and sound in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m. on a special plane at the military base at al-Maza, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to Maadi Hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers," said Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, at the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been slammed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It consists of 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 members of the special forces, carried on board two helicopters, had launched the assault in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of gunshots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, while the others fled," said the official, who demanded anonymity.
He reported that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "flash" unit had been sent to Sudan, where they received the support of German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned in Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle during a patrol with the kidnappers, killing in six, including the Chadian leader, and stopping two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlined and occupies this election campaign.
Good.
But an area of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he neglects his monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spends three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in their country's Constitution that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected representatives and government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteer individuals in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three private collections and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers throw their bulldozers against our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
When, a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalise part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states help the Belgian-Holland bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries support, to the tune of EUR 11.2 billion, this financial and insurance institution also with interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, also involving the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been growing for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions to be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy up almost half (49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will, without doubt, sell part of its holdings, among which, in the first place, the activities, essentially insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organisation ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares started a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be allowed to go into bankruptcy.
On Friday alone, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's management, is not realistic.
The company's management is accused of the uncertainty of the overseas Atlantic, in connection with the adoption of the $700 billion bailout plan, to be at the root of the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new Managing Director.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received any substantive proposals.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A fox in the henhouse
In America, health and life insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate based on information about his or her drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of information on the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it amounts to entrusting its henhouse to a fox" - recalled Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the insured capital in case of damage, on the state of health of the client who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they signed an insurance contract with them only after they had read the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he easily obtains from pharmacies the data concerning the purchase of the person's medicines within the last eighteen months. From this, the program determines himself, what disease the person suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducing, this refers to extremely high levels of fat in the blood, which immediately puts them in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is no longer much to do to the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems may still arise.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in research and analysis of data, and they must ask the patient for authorisation before collecting necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing the results of laboratory analyses and linking them with data on drug use. In this way, they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and the control of use is becoming increasingly difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning enterprises specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard admits that this is not enough and that is why he developed his program even further, which would make data transmission conditional upon the data subject's exclusive agreement.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus and ultimately, hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
Marseille's global menu
The European Union and India double their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside the other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, where cooperation in the field of atomic energy will be discussed.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a wider right to speak in international affairs, but member countries have not yet managed to agree on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit in Marseilles.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the Head of Diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double the trade, which means an increase of about 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious a target.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and in this way air trade will also be able to flourish in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's largest trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The Afghan and Pakistani situation had been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on that subject had been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade round has also been called for, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its toxic releases by at least 20 per cent until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the need for a global market at next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is now visiting the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to news agency information, the agreement would cover 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits for this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Salon with more than 403 thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honour.
It will be the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Goods and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: indeed, Italy will be present in an institutional way, with a Point Italy- 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the meeting with the press in Room Struktur, at Butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author's books is gradually decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, and in particular in relation to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the missing billionaire a year ago.
The wreck of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying on the Nevada desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at 3000 metres above sea level in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The Madera County sheriff, John Anderson, removed the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that this is the one on which Steve Fosset was travelling the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found on or around the aircraft.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreck was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene, identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
In the sixth attempt, in 2002, he became the first man to complete the round the world on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without stop.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you're not expecting.
An unusual 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
This is, in summary, Glk, the last born of the "compact" off-roads of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
Due to its out-of-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from 17 October next.
Thus the advertising threshing that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maximum displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of Milanese shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative technology Elivia8, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motor communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future acquirers? We will see well.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is ashamed now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" that has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
Neither had ever come across the opposing tifosis.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not in reality) from Campania and Puglia were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their original city appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They are inspired by English tifosery.
In Bulgaria, they found a tifosery of true Nazis, that of Levski.
La Figc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had indeed controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had an ongoing Daspo, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal waits to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take measures: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorder purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that forbids attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Luckily.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others may be added to the first one hundred and fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," says the Viminal.
So, "Keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In the Apulia there is indeed a small core of supporters of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deal with precisely the problems of stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really not pleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Observatoire du Viminal (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where resides a supporter core of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis was shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - added the first of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in order, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let's also talk about the whistles to Mameli's hymn: those too are not crimes, but if I may, they are not polite..."
