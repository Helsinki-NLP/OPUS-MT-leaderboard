At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange turned in negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ shares reached almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall the previous day, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the plan to stabilize the US financial sector, is also noticeable in our home.
Fall of actions in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even though the clues succeeded in clearing some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong stock exchange's Hang Seng index lost four per cent during trade, but later it eliminated part of the losses and reduced the decline to nearly 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
The Sydney stock exchange lost more than five per cent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to his index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange was losing 3.6 percent.
"The hesitation over rescue action in the US will affect financial markets around the world," observed Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Monetary Board.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will be affected.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which it should have spent up to $700 billion (nearly 12 billion from Kč).
The legislators thus reject the call for support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American stocks experienced a bloodbath and the main stock indices experienced the greatest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index lost nearly seven per cent, having fallen on such a scale for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in a free fall.
Congress ceded: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of financial aid to the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote early next week.
American legislators made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial aid of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion kroner) granted to the US financial system.
However, success is not certain.
In fact, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmans must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, Chairman of the House's Banking and Financial Regulatory Committee.
According to sources, the plan should a priori be put to the vote in the Senate by Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a major psychological first factor in reviving financial markets.
Given the complexity of the mechanisms through which market support can be effective, a "disillusion" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the package of measures for market stabilization should have," entrusted the Democrat Nancy Pelosi to the Bloomberg Agency.
According to her, the final vote could be taken on Sunday.
During the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the U.S. Minister of Finance Henry Paulson, in order to give the bottom of the government a final form.
It should buy back unsaleable real estate assets from financial companies, which cause financial enterprises considerable losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and must also be effective on the market.
We still need to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we are there," said Paulson.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the declining equity markets.
According to Senator Démocrate, Harry Reid did not escape, so the legislators made it possible for Congress to reach a final agreement as early as Sunday.
In this way, they want to calm down investors before they start trading in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trade.
However, for the time being, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of Congress of the United States will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations will not be blocked at the last moment by any particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
Nevertheless, there will still be many changes to the law.
The total amount intended to support the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the opportunity to block the remaining amount by following two steps: first an additional $100 billion, then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush welcomed progress in the negotiations
Although the president may put his veto on this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put the latter in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate securities, the value of which fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said that Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartite effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limiting golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, Chief Negotiator, said that legislators had agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the adjustment agreement, and the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of gilded parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides for assistance for real estate owners, who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new instalments in the case of mortgages that it will buy back, while reducing the monthly payments of debtors and allowing debtors to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that we do not know what the mechanism and the price of buying back problematic assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the division of losses between the financial sector and the government," said Marek, this week at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, Marek says it's not that important.
"It is much more important for the congressmen to agree, as early as this week, to support this plan and to devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment," Marek stressed.
An intense fight to the extreme: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there is sufficient reason to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a expensive high-end gramophone to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl records, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are vinyl records in your shelves packed with rock art, jazz or blues, you're probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same applies to music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would find it difficult to support headphones purchased for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just playing music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Besides the primary functions, telephone calls and texting, it is capable of playing music and movies, recording them, it has a camera of varying quality and can, for example, be used for navigation.
And if we take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no frigidarian can grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are almost witnessing a miracle.
However, the universal nature of the motive is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important goinfres of energy.
There are few mobiles who are able to play music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is much lower.
In this respect, the music players (especially the most rudimentary) are significantly better performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, count that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, moreover, you sometimes call from time to time, get yourself, to be sure, a second recharge for work - this is valid even for more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable, following reloading, of a continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient.
Another problem occurs when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, especially since not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
One can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without any reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need any software except iPod.
Just fill, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or according to the user's judgement.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, like the Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, focus on the battery life, the capacity of memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you will listen to it that for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of doing so today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is capable of playing.
All manage to play the MP3s and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have this format.
It is one of the most common formats and, apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also play music in WMA format.
The AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods), on the other hand, is less common.
High-end mobiles also allow, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the corresponding operator's (or other supplier's) web pages from the mobile phone and purchase the song or album.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for obtaining a musical motive.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and in most cases it is limited to radio tubes quickly made.
Nor are prices the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether via GSM, the Internet, or even the wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their motive on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to pull the motive out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
However, it is also important if you still have headphones or a handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in speakers, which virtually all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of musical mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a prize of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
However, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of an ordinary earphone output.
The price of the best telephones and the best tools, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy order.
Really anyone manages to ensure the order of the most basic readers - which do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest ones (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the control to that of a cassette set, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an exchangeable memory card slot (M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get away with even 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you should not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose more specialized mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, so that the control ease is close to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that went the farthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the brands mentioned above.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on many occasions on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The ČTÚ (Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher for us than for the rest of the Union, confirmed this.
Thus, following the European Commission's recent steps in regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators cheaper than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), who has repeatedly stated that in the Czech Republic there is no longer room for another operator, choruses with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with its own network is apparently no longer very lucky (and now it would find frequencies only difficult).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which conventional operators had to react as well.
Yet, even before the entry of such troublemakers as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were heard in Great Britain.
However, it appeared that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the Virtual Operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
Let us add that behind Mobilking there is the financial group Penta, which owns among other things the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators being the possibility to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of construction, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators become low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited range of services.
For example, in Britain, Tesco Mobile offers text messages that are at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, relying on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity shot.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone's spokesman, is in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In Czech Republic, no chance, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very pro-active.
The launch of Mobilking will instead take place in other countries in our area," said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesman for the financial group Penta.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were not in any case in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the business customer field, has not for quite a long time been hiding its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are very keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile ones.
And the sooner the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to move forward in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl's spokesman.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we could perhaps host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for now, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the moment, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us," said Vlastimil Srše
Other operators also relate to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile's spokesperson Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "We have not yet recorded a viable and bilaterally advantageous project, which could serve as a basis."
She adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator should appear in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone instead directs his attention to the completion of requests for his own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický says in relation to this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet."
Responsible authorities: in line with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a fall in prices and thus a decrease in their profit.
What is the point, then, of facilitating the advent of such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, the operators know how to agree on themselves as larrons at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of U:fon also bears witness to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on ČTÚ, when U:fon was created, was exerted by T-Mobile.
This is reflected in the information available to the public from the ČTÚ web pages.
Today, however, U:fon lends itself as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová commented: "Competition in the mobile market has also recently been amplified by the entry of a fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is obvious that the entry of an additional player would subject him, and especially his services, to high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies seems disconcerting.
However, this is not just the attitude of ČTÚ, which, unlike Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power in the Czech Republic to intervene in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
However, the latter adopted its typical position in the face of this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of potential interested parties has not a priori presented sufficient interest for conventional operators," said Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of ÚOHS in reply to our question.
Such a statement would not surprise representatives of the operators.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
All the more so since Kristián Chalupa adds: "Across the border, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephone services."
However, exerting pressure in the direction of an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not part of the interests of ÚOHS.
What is actually shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a coincidence, naturally arises.
In the same way, a price of gasoline strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not noted any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecom regulator," said Chaloupa.
One of the many points of discord is the interpretation of the dominant position on the market.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets drawn up by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts suggest a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators visibly proceed in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
Putting responsibility on the ČTÚ is a fairly common trick in communications, by means of which the ÚOHS washes hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Regrettably, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act has not been able to bring about a broadening of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This, the representatives of the ÚOHS must know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work.
However, the functioning of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies publishing their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partly public.
In most cases, multi-level marketing firms are involved.
Specific mobile telephone services are offered by, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually reach only elected officials.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company does in front of the operator is a typical business customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she obtains special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If what you're talking about happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would be looking at and that could lead to a halt in the collaboration with the company in question," answered our question on this Martina Kemrová problem.
However, it is quite unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not reached the heads of mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, they can be thousands of customers.
An operator, however, does not object to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them non-negligible benefits, and at the same time, as opposed to the true virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický points out the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, in the same way as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
This is precisely what should seem strange to ČTÚ.
In addition, there is another question to the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to be able to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim to have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions forbid it.
When we are no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a considerable fall in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, conventional operators tried, sometimes more, sometimes less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
It is precisely at this level, however, that regulators in developed countries have been involved, not in the interests of mobile operators, but in the interests of their customers.
Both by formal measures and by informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue as a hot potato that is disposed of by passing it on to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in skills is in these cases more than beneficial.
But let's not throw the handle after the bump.
If the background information says true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be back in motion.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS will hardly be able to remain impassable in the face of rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov msj (Where is my homeland?).
The anthem was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a men's or women's solo song, a chorus performance and an instrumental version.
The song is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem's arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers Czech national singing as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rozhlas (the Czech public radio station), he chose to perform solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good diction, so that the lyrics could be understood well, that they could sing simultaneously," he said.
Next year, the Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
In 1834, the song Kde domov mőj sounded for the first time on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetteiers), an original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by music by František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously adapted it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became part of the national anthem.
It remained one of seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Pragian public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into their ticketing system on Wednesday
On Wednesday 1st October 2008 will be inscribed in the history of the Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragian Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers, instead of having a paper ticket, will get into the metro, trams and buses will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers can purchase a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both have it registered on their smart card at the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the Muzeum, Městek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Latviany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
From yesterday there is also the possibility of buying coupons via the Internet on the Dopravní podnik web pages: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from the service during the morning.
Those who will start using the online store may definitely forget the counters in the metro stations, where they had to trample with impatience in long queues so far in order to obtain paper tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their coupon via the Internet and will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of the passengers a counter with trained staff, who will help the interested parties with the purchase via internet and, in addition, will register the coupon they have bought on their card," said the spokesperson for the Martin Opatrný project.
Besides the libraries, it will also be possible to record the electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compost the tickets and the passengers may have already noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today the city has five, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
Automate will check the coupon instead of the driver
The automatons that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply insert the Opencard chip card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
This is known in the peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the communes of Central Bohemia mainly use to reach the capital.
"In the integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transports from Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, using which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of the coupons;" explained the control of the Filip Drápal tickets of the Ropid organization, which designs the schedules of the public transports in Pragois.
The peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's cash register.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the indicated place on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the checked coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal added.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and do not remember the date of expiry of their coupon, can rejoin the vending machines, which were originally used to record coupons on the card.
This is where information about the validity of their document will be displayed on the camera screen.
The Sudetes were calling for a referendum in the USA
The Sudeten Germans asked in 1945 for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This is the result of a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of the Southern Bohemian).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly addressed the president of the US with such a desire.
This stems from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov pray in the letter to the US President not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is dear."
Given that the rallying to Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only of brutality, dishonest attitude, incomprehension, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would only have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether its inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of post-war history, appear somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it illustrates well the expectations of the Germans of the Sudeten of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted such a possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to obtain a certain type of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war he was, as a German from České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When, at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to consult him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war felt, according to him, that, following the Beneš decrees, he would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign to Attack Drivers
Action aimed at the most costly road safety in Czech history.
A way to characterize the emotional media campaign that intends to launch, on Wednesday, the Ministry of Transport.
Minister Aleš's office believes that it will discourage drivers from engaging in dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign costing 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and driving alcohol.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, she wants to reach out to young drivers, bikers and pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The sentence "You don't think" is printed in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay life for a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be seen commonly.
It believes that this will lead to a reduction in the accident rate and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The strategy of sugar and whipping against drivers
"What works with drivers is the system of sugar and whipping.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time, when they grill a red light.
The whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, the psychologist believes.
In his view, signs that signal the danger to drivers are already less effective.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably quickly merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would return in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, President of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"He who desires security in Jerusalem, and above all does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, when several people were killed and dozens of people injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historic places" located inside the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work," he said afterwards.
Retreat from Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed his support for Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which, in his view, is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts by Damascus.
"I am not proposing to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to obtain the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relations with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to give up their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (Terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance bus is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether the stewards and passengers can travel within the coach during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus's path.
The girl was at that time unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two more seats at her disposal.
However, the coach can have an accident or even a sudden brake, also when the steward serves coffee or distributes newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is under its technical data sheet equipped with standing or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, the passengers shall remain seated.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have standing places; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the director of the company Radim Jančura.
"This is a matter that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at first, it prohibits the movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that the passengers can go to the bathroom during the trip provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no single legal interpretation of the role of steward - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement also prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The law on road transport only knows the term "vehicle receiver"; it does not define its rights and duties," added Hanzelka, with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law adequately addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the coach has in its approval permission to propose standing places.
It's all in there," he said.
Buses are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, tolls with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long distance buses without standing places with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As on the plane, says an expert.
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"During regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
There, too, it is not sure when turbulence will occur and the air hostess can hit her head."
"But in the event that the bus would have braked abruptly, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
In the same way as on an urban bus or in a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the stewards by internal requirements," he says and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agency is the only coach carrier to offer stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their trade to be a trade at risk.
"However, as soon as I feel that this is a risky job, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper on boarding.
It would also reduce costs," he said.
The safety concern is the reason given by the director of Asiana Alexey Litvine for the absence of stewards in his vehicles, who, in comparison with SA, ensures a very small number of lines.
"We don't have a hostess. We've been opposing it from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, in Týden.cz.
A great tragedy has come
A young hostess from the region of Plzes, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a flasher and blocked the way to the bus.
The driver of the latter tried to avoid him by means of a sudden manoeuvre, but he approached him by his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved for the stewards' rest have been sold.
"In the case of long-distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the judgment of the court, but as regards the financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the Act?
Not in sight
An amendment to the Act, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could clarify the travel of stewards on board the bus.
"However, it did not reach any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones at the wheel," said expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, noting that the control of the safety of coaches is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois rest on Frankfurt.
The key words were not missing in the letter from the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive start to further mergers in the Länder banking sector.
This is what it looks like when an executive committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the injured WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Supervisory Authority of Financial Services which, only recently, made it clear to the Government of the Land of North Rhine-Westfalia that time was involved in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - there has been a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Of course, the head of Deta-Bank Franz Waas indicated at the presentation of the half-year figures at the end of August that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a Land bank, be it the Helaba or the WestLB.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the Länder banks and the savings banks, has instructed the steering committee to conduct discussions with WestLB for joint business activities.
This could be the flow of the financial market, or parts thereof.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial sphere.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, which, together with its 3000 employees, counts for one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre, comes into play when it comes to the consolidation of the savings banks sector.
In 2003 it was thought for a while that Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
Nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had barely been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse had voted against Hellaba's participation in them.
Subsequently, the other two houses did not join either.
The Land Bank of Rhineland Palatinate was attached to the Land Bank of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the consolidation of the Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, expressed his opposition to any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Bavarian Land Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land Bank could take shape first.
For the Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for further mergers is to increase, the potential partners are gradually escaping.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and credit union group, which owns 85 per cent of Helaba's capital, has, on the other hand, blocked any union with WestLB at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB would remain in the strictest position.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one aspect.
Another aspect raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, namely how the future capacity of Länder banks should be ensured, had not been resolved so far by the German savings and credit union group.
In the long run, a WestLb stripping could take place, which here is obviously not desired.
That is also what is referred to in the letter from the existing Executive Board: in any event, a "global solution" for the establishment would be envisaged.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena accompanies her as a girlfriend, so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 visitors of the beer festival what deep sounds its gossip can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure tonight at 11:45 pm, `destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6:30 am.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, on one of the buses only travel from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing from the back and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with large silver frames.
For the last five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three trips this year alone.
They go there by night, stay at the party all day, and come back at 10:30.
To spend the night there would involve unnecessary costs, Marco explains.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with the Bavarian law of purity, health insurance and a head of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already the buses drive in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything becomes quiet on the bus, the travellers sleep.
It's better this way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian license plates again take a break shortly before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning, Marco's group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking lot near Place Thérèse, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, to dress with the little yellow cap.
Above is written to the left 'Beer Festival', in gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: "When the doors of the beer tent open, we run," shouts Marco in the early morning.
`Run!' Run and reserve places at the bottom of the tent.
`Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to divide them in the room!'
The cup, Marco shouts, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the check-in!
`Show the security officers that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `Tonight, to have come back here at ten and a half hours!' Got it?
And that's it, it's off to the beer party.
On the way, someone takes yellow caps to the trees to find the way, to the signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the `Italian weekend'.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 people going through the Alps and falling down in the beer booth, 10 percent of the visitors would have come on purpose from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police force is reinforced by seven police officers from South Tirol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross, who compile statistics on the countries where Italians occupy the first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by Italians is the Hofbräu Brewery tent.
Nights of insomnia for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, insisted the Federal Minister of Finance only a few weeks ago.
How fortunate that the politician used the word 'relatively' and that he slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the side of the DAX, obtains from a consortium of German banks a credit of one billion to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter-society bears the losses.
The state financier had, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, the own capital rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions fell from the same period in the previous year to zero, profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities and the termination of provisions in credit transactions had fallen from over 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it was only thanks to the large profits from the repayment of downstream accounting costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern companies that the shortfall in earnings of about 16 percent turned out to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had first misspeculated on industrial real estate loans, which had then been wired to Aareal Bank.
Because conventional state financing was not profitable enough, Depfa then became more intensively involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, the Hypo Real Estate must carry out depreciations which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which nevertheless remains unclear.
The fact is that the dividends have been reduced.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor since the acquisition of Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market as it does not have any customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks has again become considerably more difficult, with banks accumulating their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs a short-term refinancing medium for a portion of Depfa's total credits - about EUR 50 billion - annually.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing requirement is covered with medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of working order.
Other sources say that refinancing would be ensured through the funds until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke explained, however, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Supervision of Financial Services (Bafin) assume that the Hypo Real Group's market capacity is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope so.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the fact that the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the gates of insolvency on Sunday late in the evening, this temporary rescue at least will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
The price of bonds, on the other hand, is particularly good.
While debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-rate loans are declining.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and of course those which have a lifespan beyond 2009.
The bonds of the bank Hypo Real Estate previously seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself which brought the crisis into the establishment by the acquisition of the bank Depfa.
As long as the issuing institutions, governments and less affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that arrears will be resorption over time.
Or it will happen what no one dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability that approached safety has now become a mere hope founded.
This should set aside nights of insomnia above all for long-term creditors on whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can still use what they have drawn a line from to represent a carry-over of losses for the next few years on the next tax on capital income from automatically deducted equity gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of Bento's box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is due for the first day at the Tachibana Highschool, girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Exchange Log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Highschool of Tachibana.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of the courses does not seem to be set as strict as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students appear one after the other from eight hours, until at nine hours minus twenty, a round table begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to like talking to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue up socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, I presented myself to the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all done low Masses, laughter and signs, and I have constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential for the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage".
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me gave me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assailed by the rules.
Everyone spoke to whom better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's quite difficult to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My host mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox to me - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, little sausages, a salad of cucumbers and seaweeds, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things have a weird appearance and a completely new taste.
What's for sure is that everything is really good.
All right, except maybe the candied salt plums, brunch!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento that she has prepared herself, and that is prepared especially carefully - in the hope of being able to get a little better acquainted with the boy during the break.
I read this in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could watch it here too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
Then I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what?"
In the end, reading mangas is what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the manga and the culture there, at one point I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we check that he feels the same way when he behaves in the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having so far been able to prove it just as one cannot prove that other human beings have a consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of the feeling or in general the consciousness, we enter into terrains that are difficult to practicable because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it kills, flees or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists deduce a comparable subjective experience.
However, I do not believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transposition of our subjective experience to that of animals difficult.
One aspect is that the circuits associated almost always with human consciousness include the prefrontal lateral Cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
So at least for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the Prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to anticipate and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant feature could lie in the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence being linked to language, it often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that the animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ a lot from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, as a result of this particular hardware, to be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses major problems for us.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
One could examine animal consciousness processes without considering their content, and that is exactly what happened in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nerve correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the Prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result then for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
What we designate as "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its sequels, such as the reactions of the body) grabs alive memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions that characterize primates and especially man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to impute them to others than to ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the cortex and cerebral trunk, just like Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations of any kind.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that is indisputable.
Pankseep argues that what appears as fear in both men and rats is likely to be felt as fear in both cases: how can we check whether rats and men feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach flees from danger, but if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviours are not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, the nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for humans: how can we demonstrate this in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?) have sensations.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations probably differ completely from ours (since the human consciousness rests on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, there is progress on the nervous plane, as the same is measured in rats and humans.
As I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It could be seen as short-term, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotion.
Platini, UEFA President: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in collaboration with Poland, the European championships," announced Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries."
In the timetable for the construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts run after the deadlines.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at maximum speed," declared the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent administrator.
The commission had met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a real danger that the PZPN will not be able to act properly," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"We assured the UEFA President in a letter that preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already convicted in the previous season for manipulating compulsory relegation; in the end, the League's beginning had to be staggered at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote for a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and is now in trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her ex-adulter Dennis Quaid.
It foams - and counter-attack.
A late Rose War for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are waging a disgracious battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of the marriage failure: "Dennis was me for a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have been aware of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adulterer.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband rating clearly fell: it would be "Monstrual," said this one at the 54-year-old New York Daily News, that "Meg re-strikes the history of our relationship and manipulates it."
It would also be "regrettable", that "the pain and upheavals of divorce for each child be revived in public" for their 16-year-old common son Jack."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and soon becomes the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the claw: "At least my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going best."
Airfares and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Hotel flights and nights would have become advantageous again - this is the result of a study by American Express's travel and financial services provider.
The company analysed its reservation data for the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, recorded a sharp decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices rose in 41 of the 48 European cities examined again by an average of 6.9 per cent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities examined.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low price of the dollar that led to a "descending travel desire of American tourists".
Financial centres such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by hotel prices falling than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices stand at 26.3 per cent, the highest in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were fuel-intensive, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, in business class and first class, however, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices had risen by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter, prices fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, declining economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand would fall in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition under the Open Sky Treaty, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the removal by the airlines of non-profitable routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies in Europe alone.
HSV beats Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes the first in the standings.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
Gladbach's player didn't get into the game until late and his raised shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, he had come out of his lips in a persuasive manner.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled in the hall of the Hamburg arena locker room.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, half-time was over and most of them had sat down in their place.
Rieger was for nearly three decades the physiotherapist of HSV, he enjoys a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at the strategic locations.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol acquiesced and raised his thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's chief coach Martin Jol.
Of which the orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
The practice has failed.
"It wasn't all very good to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "worried also to be more relaxed."
This 1:0 (1:0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a successful headstroke by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak Gladbach players could not hurt the weak Hamburg players.
"It's been a dirty victory," said Marin Jol.
The Hamburg SV will celebrate its 121th anniversary on Monday.
Already Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first in the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate result of the table reflects more the unpredictability of the first League than the domination of his HSV.
The team with its late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petric as well as Jansen debauched from FC Bayern – is certainly forming slowly, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day in history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little bit.
Around 8:30 p.m., the world's largest stock market index was at 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange Index was at 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The biggest losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express, which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could make any more profits.
The shares of the Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized to purchase what is called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum must not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in conjunction with the change in the price in order to reduce the burden on the public treasury.
Stock prices sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
Billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not pay off investors' concerns.
The course of action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax towards the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is collapsing despite the government's bailout of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank led to a deep deficit in the German index (Dax).
The action of Bavarian real estate financiers has lost three quarters of its value at the moment despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has recorded a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid well below the important psychological bar of 6,000 points and was at 5.839 points with a deficit of 3.7 per cent.
Worldwide, stock markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York City, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were concerned that the US Government's $700-billion heavy bailout plan could not be sufficient to re-start financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost 334 points or 3.3 per cent in the first hour of opening.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
The other European stock exchanges also experienced only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index fell by 3.2 per cent at the moment, and the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743.61 points after an increase from 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index derailed from 2.1 per cent to 18.286.90 points.
In India, the main Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 per cent and closed at 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to the 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist multinational also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers perplexed: dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
As a result of soon-frozen fuel conductions, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvring of space probes, by which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
Thus, the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the Ulysses solar probe.
This is what has surprised researchers for many years: flying objects do not always behave at 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravity.
More than that, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They baptized him with the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts were concerned that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter due to space curvature, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is called the dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have only known the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the scientists' calculations, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
Tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage-takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for the ransom would be already under way.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This was communicated in concert by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are checking their health," said Frattini.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are doing well and safe, announced the Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting before the hostages were released are still unclear: for example, the kidnappers would have been close to putting an end to the abduction, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
All we had to do was collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" happened.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The hostage takers had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a father-in-law who led to suicide
A court has been informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent charges.
The Truro High Court referred that he regularly bound his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confessional letter: "I feel responsible for his death".
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, 34 years old, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, Trerise had tied her up and bandaged her before forcing her into sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that National Trust volunteer Ms. Randle was haunted by the abuses she had been subjected to twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that friends had said that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had appeared since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the father-in-law of his daughter, who had also written a letter of confession which concluded: "I regularly tied her up and bandaged her."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must have been terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This unpleasant saga ended in the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is the fact that if she hadn't made this gesture, her story would certainly never be over in court."
He added: "In particular, as his father and mother describe, I stress the effects of your crime on Stephanie for years.
"Without these, she would no doubt be a happy, promising and successful young woman today."
Sentencing for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office ministerial officer who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June will be sentenced by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man from the Department of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents, on a train heading for Waterloo.
The documents passed into the hands of the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They thought this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of Section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause dealing with the safeguarding of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associate Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from his home to a secret place.
Building companies facing invoice B&B.
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of more than £80 million to cover the bailout of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect deposits of the 2.6 million savers of Bradford & Bingleys.
Interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that collect money from savers, including 59 building companies.
The general manager of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when the Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are released.
But the interest that will increase at the same time will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that harvest the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved prudently... now have to pay some of the institutions' bills that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is said that each company must pay a sum proportional to the deposits it holds, and that the intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the building companies trading committee, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved prudently when the real estate market is resumed now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
"We need to look at all aspects of this case in the coming weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent building companies and their members from paying this salt bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September of this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could double.
Since building companies are non-shareholder organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five penny a liter
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the wholesale price of her milk, by five pennys per litre, starting on Monday.
This is the second price increase that follows a two-penny increase in February, following research by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide whether to go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had been last varied in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh was denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a motion for bail to former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested upon his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to give him bail because of his indictment for extorting a businessman, 50 million Taka ($729.000.00) when she was PM.
This case is one of many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but her party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government first give her full freedom.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of her release were contradictory because, if allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's motion that she does not require bail since she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the elections in December.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October, said a former leader of the Awami party.
She was detained last year after the interim military government assumed power, but was released in June to take care of herself abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the accusations against them.
Concerns about the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN said.
Last week, the United Nations conducted a vaccination campaign in the six provinces.
However, she stated that she was unable to contact children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar, located in the south.
A United Nations spokesman said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its case following the Competition Commission's verdict, which would require it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV transmitter.
The Competition Appeal Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its shares of ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to unfairly influence ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now known as Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Bureau reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV's shares cast doubt on the effective independence of ITV, thereby encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and Ofcom regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just waived its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorneys' case.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special accuser to verify the dismissal of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
All this came from the record of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
Special Accused Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"Several allegations of potentially criminal conduct, unfounded, have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
One of his greatest recommendations was the appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify.
The dispute began with the de-listing in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had declared that prosecutors were dismissed because of poor benefits.
But then it emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to the dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others refused to investigate accusations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute the courts for the government.
It is certain that they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered him to be "first responsible" for these dismissals, and eventually "absorbing" his role as leader," remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including Bush's former collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of their failure to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honoured at the Q Awards for his epic Bat Out Of Hell song.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of Meat Loaf's 1977 album.
The award evening is presented by Coldplay, this year with a selection restricted to four categories.
Q magazine editor Paul Rees said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was put on the market in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, ranking 15th.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, by his real name- has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to cure his heartbeat that became irregular, after having collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngite forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Sombre Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon on Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents don't know how to give directions to get to Extra Place, because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks like a dusty alley rather than an active artery.
. No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repave Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbors, said they were charmed by this shortcut simply because there is one of the last and oldest blocks of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that runs the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the Neighbourhood Owners' Committees, representatives from city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal to allow the real estate builder to buy the street.
But the committee prefers that the street remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee #3.
"There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose to restore and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to repaint the small street and install seats there, some of them would be used by a café to which the builder would concede space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay's spokesperson, said that while the company wants to operate the street, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to re-look this abandoned alley, and make it public," she said, pointing out that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for the Preservation of the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing, moreover, that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colourful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after this since 1802, when the legacy of Philip Minthorne's many children's large farm was divided, leaving aside this little piece of land, which has since been abandoned.
The later entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, has re-opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo on the cover of the album of Ramones" Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the picture in November 1976.
It was full of scrap metal, rags, barrels, posters, sheets and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the evolution towards the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity- a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be ruined in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (titled "The Book of Contests: A Nostalgic Bitter Look at A City in the Extinction Process") tells the history of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small narrow cul-de-sac, dark day and night, bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and Persians, full of newspapers from last week that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agitation down the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffitis on the walls, a bottle of empty 22 ounces of beer, rests next to newspapers that have just been thrown away.
Some passers-by said they rarely think about Extra Place, and suggested its development.
Mr. Field, for his part, suggested that some underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its present state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English Language
In this part of the Education Supervision program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California Studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Thought it. Why Middle Classes Must Choose Their School."
Attracting favors from Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign points out that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a true fact.
To combat these differences, Obama's education programme supports among many other subjects, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, Obama's question is whether his desire to achieve a bilingual education that defends non-English language classroom instruction goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
Students at this school are largely Hispanic, and low-income.
More than a third of the students, made up of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the students of the CM1, 100% passed the state math exam of 2008, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students have passed the English-Language-Arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that put forward by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, constant capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Obama could copy," reports Linda Mikels, Sixth Street principal, "this school has introduced instruction in the English language "full immersion".
Total English immersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Shouldn't Obama take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in other schools made up mostly of Hispanic students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognosis of Obama's response.
Although immigrants are in favour of the fact learning English, Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop arguing about the wording of laws in English.
"On the contrary, he said, "you have to make sure your child speaks Spanish."
If Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than disdaining them or considering them insignificant.
Oil Nette falls as a result of the New Concerns of the World Economy
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, because people fear that the bailout plan for financial markets will succeed in bringing the economy back to life.
The futures of crude oil, fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Stock Exchange, at this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by more than $20 in the barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After an increase of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in view of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again worried despite the agreement on the rescue plan, the biggest in history, concluded this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be harsh.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster, Citygroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital have said that the frenzied negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement " seem to have failed to revive the market".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"Foresight of global equity, interest rates and market exchange, has become uncertain" wrote Deutsche Bank analysts in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
"With regard to raw materials, our most pressing concern is to understand how far the American virus would spread globally and in particular in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were forced to reduce oil and gas price forecasts by 20 percent for 2009.
The Feast of the Determining Second Time for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform with the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had been dirty playing under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a precursor sign of an afternoon during which their relationship made a leap forward.
Favre found Coles for another two touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from half time.
"I didn't get out of my area," Favre said about all his passes in Coles.
"he's a mediocre player."
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of the Bowens Balloon, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking an advantage of 34 to 0.
It was the best that the Jets could have scored in a while.
"Jets coach Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said "second or third?"
When he was told the two-the Jets passed 21 indisputable points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second time more than the third.
"A lot of points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpassing his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2:03:59 of an accommodative race on the flat, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2:04:26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35 years old, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance, from the 1600 metres of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps in an exaggerated way in today's eyes – that air pollution will increase her asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions- sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the finish- Gebrselassie won on Sunday, now an impressive average of a mile in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Track runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into cross-country runners, have contributed to the decline of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 .
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters, suffered cramps at the calf two weeks before, and missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best."
He was criticized - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia- for having too orchestrated his races, avoiding the world stars of the marathon, actually relying on the hares as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's abilities as a background runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. midway.
Two Kenyan elite riders, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the leaders disappeared.
A little over three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year obtaining the seventh time of 2:19:19.
Englishman Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko, surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
She ran by a skilful strategy, letting the group of Ethiopian and Kenyan riders take a nice advantage, then exceeding them about 18miles 1⁄2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city in Part, the Orgue and the trials of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sun, the brilliant and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to enter, the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to make nowadays."The city at five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guavas, two schools and no jail."
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Zora Festival, held each year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Renaissance Harlem.
And in various ways, the city it describes- has become touristic thanks to its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression-era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is as independent, worthy, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "knows us so little, doesn't know what he's losing".
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has indeed invoked an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious from the foreign perspective.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a resident of the city and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black takeover and a community of almost 2400 people with a poverty rate twice as high as the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of a black rural Southist culture - sometimes disdained, sometimes acclaimed - that recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
Interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere, dialectical books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida's guide transformed this city, located just off Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten centre of Florida, into a chapter of black history and human drama.
Audacious like a big box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"cross the road to the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its gardens and well-preserved playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he barely knows how to read and write.
She also mentioned Widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by people passing by.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government, but also with literacy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson's young girls that Hurston immortalized, citing the colourless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "some people didn't like it."
Hurston is always remembered as a lively and eccentric person who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair on the back patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some grave in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plaque for the general public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or legacy that she offered to the world," said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A crucial moment occurred in the 1980s.
Public officials in Orange County wanted to move a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, a two-lane main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the western corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville was just recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over race mixing led to hatred at the gates of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of young whites were throwing oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady has even died. "
They threw a watermelon out of their car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race".
Residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and weakened the confidence of young people.
"Black children used to be kissed--I remember well--we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as chief director of the Safeguard of the Eatonville Community, a nonprofit group.
It lasted, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white--I mean there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have made it possible to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a joyful self-confidence and guidelines such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a true best seller, reintroduced it to American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when the most famous daughter in Eatonville had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a savior.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the story rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Miss Boyd summed up the whole thing saying "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single-themed library (renamed of course Hurston) opened in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a posterior rear street on a summer rain day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(now 90 percent black)
The foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
You have to ask permission for most interviews, and some things- like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields- must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weakness for bright red, are still afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston Festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to view Eatonville as Hurston's entire race: beautiful, problematic and all, not better or worse, but as proud, creative, hardworking, crazy and mixed up as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is indeed the sincere civic affection that is heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years old, twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think: "Oh, this city hasn't compared anything to any other" Alondra Kenon said after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a beautiful city".
Here in New York, everyone is fluent in finance.
Still, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan kept away from the booth and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their head, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "workday in the office" since the 1929 crack.
The delivery people continue to sneak on the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
Latinos always drag between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanged on a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to queue to buy their morning sandwiches from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4pm and 7pm on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic narratives until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I was discovering at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, some 20 people in line.
Not in front of the cashiers' counters, nor to withdraw from the case or make a payment, but in front of the customer service counter, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked the management for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would later learn from Starr, my "authorized personal banker", all stood up for the same reason I did.
Not in the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They have withdrawn their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and that claim to treat customers as their family.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the past few days, Washington Mutual, a $327-dollar capital bank has resorted to the bankruptcy trustee, and while New Yorkers were coming home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, was desperately looking for a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees in front of me, scared of another potential break-up, transferred their money to a bank that they think is reliable, the one that makes the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I heard a lady at my local Chinese supermarket talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bank that went bankrupt, and her meagre general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed concierge of my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings into the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Muslim Tombs Desecrated as Austria oscillates to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization of the "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They wear road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
Police accuse extreme right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of extreme right-wing political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at the Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning; it is an organized action, according to the police.
The delinquents painted Jewish symbols such as David's Star on several graves; however, detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise the hatred of extremists towards Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said that he was "profoundly shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan, which was coming to an end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right during yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even viewed, according to critics, as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, led his campaign against wearing the scarf and burkas, and even expressed opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties try to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the far right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Courts have banned glamorous rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after expressing his intention to go to Spain via France to the authorities under his control.
The Kent Police issued this travel ban last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse of a child.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the Ashford Courts of Limited Jurisdiction hearing, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court spokesman said "Thursday, September 25th at the Ashford Court, Kent police asked for an application to prevent Mr.Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25th.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there at the time."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even though he was registered on the list of sexual abuse suspects.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his scheduled departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent's police stated that they would not discuss the specific cases or potential movements of Glitter in the story.
A Kent Police spokesman said, "The Kent police will do everything they can to protect our children as well as those from abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"Protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we closely monitor the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region, in order to minimize the potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, 10 and 11 respectively.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok from where he should have boarded a flight to London.
But he declared that he was not feeling well, and refused to go to London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from checking passports, and at the end he went to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore obliged to return to Bangkok; Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22, and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as required by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling in France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the stage to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no tight clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, liberated from all tensions to obtain the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these unknown moments of the general public, where we discover to intimate gestures and stolen looks artists who do not care to get on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of a few performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less well-known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer takes up the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy ... captivating the audience.
To capture moments of personality of these artists you must not make photos on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars."
Bauer began a long journey to photograph singers, guitarists, or dancers with a plaque camera with the "Popular Mining Song" festival in 1997.
They are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, reminisce of classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classical side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day".
It is not about dance or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captures the public with his art.
The search for the essentials and magic was the constant of this work which we present these days at the El Fotómata gallery.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book about the portraits exhibited at the gallery.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves to photograph people's portraits, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long moment.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You find yourself in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know or who just give you a few minutes to get them a picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (street parallel to the People's Garden of Hercules) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he is working, a novel that has as main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through the Amazon.
The favourite at the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Segovia festival, that the novel that currently occupies it "is a true audacity" and that "everything shows that it should not be written".
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people march in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award with the majority of the participants' voices, made a full room at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself confronted with a fascinate audience who did not see the time spent during which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great deal of humor, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "very methodical way" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less like," because writers have been asked "not to let go of frivolity" and to fulfill their vocation.
The bad weather is ruining the fair of Pozoblanco
The banderilla party that concluded the bull races at the Pozoblanco Fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse toreadors checked that the arena was impassable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad weather went hard on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was rain that prevented the celebration of the second bull race planned.
On the poster, there were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz y Juan Bautista, who should have faced each other in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and was worn in triumph, after having made arm movements facing the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two strips planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered stands applauded more than his fight in himself with the bull.
Even worse for El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the public.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five hours minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) on the border of the municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter begin the flight.
Its cargo, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police pursued them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to the information disclosed by the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government.
The arrested person was charged with drug trafficking and forgery of documents.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further down the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police officers finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The posterior part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish bales and then transferred to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one written on the grey card of the van, which is why they also charged the detainee with an offence of forgery of documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the provenance of the seized drug.
The inmate, A.A.J., aged 28, was taken into custody to carry out the various procedures and will be tried within the following hours.
The actress Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the influence of a medicine
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) for driving under the influence of a medicine.
A witness saw her do strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, based on what a spokesman for the California police patrol revealed to People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "weaned down on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses".
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first did not recognize the actress, saw Locklear stopping in the middle of the highway and leaving her vehicle.
This person, at that time, called the emergency department because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the agents took her to the drug and alcohol centre for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the police officers' observation at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of driving under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated around 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of Parliament for the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of performing preferential treatment to members of his family.
"In these cases, I am a very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation that will have to assume its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the behaviour of the political party that it will have to adopt within the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left called for investigations to show "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency".
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sing of Mayo", Garci's dared bet
Based on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "Sangre de mayo", which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage the many characters and to illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film, lasting more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in the cinema next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid of more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós's literature, José Luis Garci assures him of having made with this film "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him, three years ago, to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2nd Madrid, something that he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Commune of Madrid is a "one-off opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothing the atmosphere of "a Spain that was the wrong leader for the fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to rebellions during the reign of Ferdinand VII", he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not receive funding as for the films "Captain Alariste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost all of his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" influenced on his usual way of working, on the staging of the actors, with whom he is accustomed to repeat before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep informed".
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times a candidate for the Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo", "Seven tables de billiards français" and finally the winner, "The Blind Sunflowers", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "which would deserve to be better known", he declared.
With this movie Garci doesn't expect a prize.
"At first you think you're working for posterity, then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're just making an extra movie," Garci says after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the shoes of the sevillane dancer Tórtola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to an equally sevillane dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and at the age of three will live in London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and an oriental dancer.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the history of dance in Europe of the inter-war period, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to perform the sevillane dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers," she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La puerta abietta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with the one who was his pupil.
"Matilde transforms Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a part in my work and it honors me. "
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song by Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón, the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas".
This work also recounts, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it's these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and showcases her work," Bayón says.
The show will start at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope Theatre in Vega
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a newly married Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their death.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " are coming to an end with the reissue of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This poplar of light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling to the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia purchased eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most well-known Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them."
This sentence is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of malice", and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar.
He hasn't been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better because of its existence."
No one was afraid of making themselves ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of cinema and the homeland died during a particularly obscure period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightening, American esteem has fallen very low, desperately seeking grounds for dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, human beings have only admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He was an ideal of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the anti-drug fight created in honor of his deceased elder following an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled to impose itself against a suicidal food culture.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, Englishman Daniel Craig, found that none James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscarized Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was the highlight of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He has set us the high bar," said George Clooney, who is perhaps the only one today trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's the one trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful even if he did not lack opportunities to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he proudly attends the encounter of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been as proud as the dedicated husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and philanthropist," he says.
Madrid in the race to organise the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize the Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, it could be realized in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been to.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be scored as a playoff.
But let's look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the removal of the numbers, which obliges you to go in advance.
It's not bad, but if they make you move it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for shopping).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the bib (first mistake, move only for that) and (after a long queue) surprised!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and then cheaper?
Well, this is nothing about what happened on the day of the races.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we had not yet left our backpack at the entrance, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which rebellions and assaults of the barracks took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me which, I think, did not correctly mark the start.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympic Games.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft's Emerging Technologies conference, a new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented, a kind of Artificial Intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company's campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Through a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remembering what positions they occupy - and listening to and hearing the key words of their conversations.
But also group them into groups of conversation
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks her if she's here to visit someone and tells her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked about a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This is a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has continuously added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is Google's first step in competing with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the necessary basis for computer hardware and software to be understood.
He holds the same position as your wife or husband when you have to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but we must see the "death" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operational system but more and more to the Internet browser.
We only turn on the computer to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Which can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, congested month, less complex.
For now, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I am showing you an example.
The photo in this article was taken earlier this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage distributor, a poster shows their request to use their own search tool - "Your research. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 at the same time.
The phone, after all, is more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, so it will cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the holding of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we begin to enumerate all his appearances, we could also mention this mustachu costume that raised weights in a travelling circus.
It's not just a simple men's bodysuit made of cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel of Brussels stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as 'Marcel' - which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the most famous body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But she also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Garments designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it is a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
According to Monica, they're not just beautiful and famous girls who lend their names.
It was present at the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new head office but also at the presentation of the most important prices of fashion that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the ' Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 50s and 60s enchants us and we draw a lot from it for our collections.
I like to walk around town and watch women see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end everything is coming together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was very little, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's wardrobes and to see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes that's when you really get into the character's skin.
So it's all connected.
You were not long ago 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years are making me happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and savors life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was little and it has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to become a mom because my body asks me and, moreover, I want to become a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's go to the movies, you wait for the different movies you made last year to come out.
It's true, I can't wait for them to come out.
As a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the films 'La última hora' and 'En busca de la tumba de Cristo' to come out.
See what you think...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to do the model.
Quite simply, Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for quite a while, to invite me to participate in a charity parade in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I have exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
People that Naomi is a person with a tender heart.
They say so much about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, that good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for Third World women.
Recidivists from alcohol to the wheel will have to install the 'alcolock' system.
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative penalties for alcoholism, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of drunkenness, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project which will last a year.
Its aim is the rehabilitation of the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, as well as the Directorate General of Road Safety and the Foundation Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of drunkenness, take the car back.
Alcolock would avoid this because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not blow before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and is borne by the driver.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced infringements by up to 65% in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save the lives of 115 people every year.
This measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, but criminal reform requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 1740, the scheduled official time, the plane of the Spanish Air Force in which the Asturias Princes were travelling landed in the presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of sunset, but her rays still forced her to put her hand as a visor to see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours ago I asked the taxi driver in the street whether he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we can't go to the airport to pick up customers at this time... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I lived here thinking two years.
- Ah, all right...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the journey.
They are several to wait in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military row composed of 27 naval soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when to her, has her hair in the wind, is dressed very soberly and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop at the photographers before going to the hall where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a funny Mexican television journalist awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is certainly no more extraordinary and good living cartoonist living than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be rewarded with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's window at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she was almost weeping with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface area.
The first shop is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
As a table next to that of the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
By having big on her heart and making bad fortune good heart, because of her brother's recent death, Nati put on a Mango garment and some of ELAH's trimmings, which cut her breath, and arm on it, arm on it with her son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in her honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron of Rotchil ended the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who showed up at the store with pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner changed her clothes by wearing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the good old days, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big folded'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the palace outbuildings, but she showed us before on her cell phone pictures of her son.
The following morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another handsome man who travels by motorbike – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, towels and having asked beforehand, that there be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the stress reduction number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to top it all out, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to the booksellers on September 30th.
The waking-up almost saddens us when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think of the agitated rhythm that today's life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But well, 1001, neither one more nor one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to each one's taste and time.
The antistress work is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and will arrive at the booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquillity in places such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline doesn't run through your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talking while sleeping
Some kids talk at night.
I do not refer to those who wake up very awake by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but in reality it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep that is called somniloquia.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon can appear very sporadically (once in life for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often related to other changes in sleep such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (weeping in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fevers, situations of stress or overexcitation.
In any case, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, whispers or on the contrary with shouts, tears, long speeches ...
In the event that somniloquia becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another deterioration of sleep that can be treated (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, seek quiet games and avoid programmes or television series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who are struggling to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down inside.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will no longer remember what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and restes.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when he sleeps, he's not aware that he can organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, so pay attention to the way you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to know his secrets.
Not even joking.
It causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeuserrn finally regained the path of victory on his field after a long period of food shortages.
Without making a big game, the Yellows and Blacks created the largest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting where the attackers struggled to express themselves.
After a first attempt by visitor captain Kauffmann who was approaching the skylight on a shot from a distance, Illhaeusern would take slightly the ascendant and turn Fonderflick from a distance, then with Hirn above, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold would tickle Dannemarie's defense.
Oppositely, we would block in the middle of the field and just leave him stirring Riahi at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half was going to be decisive with two occasions signed first by Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well positioned to resume a ball repelled on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd').
But the Illhousian scorer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to enjoy it and will not pose any big problems to an Ilhousian Eleven who has just receded a little to "compact" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game where, after a big burglary, the ball passed very close to the cross-section.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of force of the fishermen who have severely disrupted on Monday the accesses of several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he "will come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general assembly of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the surge in gas oil prices, which reached a record at more than €1.14 per litre on average.
According to the spokesman for the Elysée David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected on a firm foot by the fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, resulting in traffic jams of nearly 10 km.
The pleasure port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not stopped.
A filter dam has been launched on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors have already shown on Monday their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic facade and the Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where the trawlers remained at dockside, or in Le Havre, where some 20 boats blocked the movement of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped in the evening the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must in fact decide on Tuesday the follow-up to be given to the movement and its participation in the interview planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go" and "do not want to travel to Paris", announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel fuel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre, but they estimate that a boat's profitability threshold is only reached with a diesel fuel of less than 0.30 euro per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable interpreter of "Butch Cassidy and Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes praised film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threat of recession that is hovering on the world economy.
The fourth global aeronautical manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes much of the Chinese market especially for its aircraft in the range of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divestment of more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed out, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and retirement activity in the United States, says the newspaper, which cites sources close to the file.
The board of directors of AIG met on Sunday evening to discuss possible divestitures, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp. air leasing subsidiary, its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these divestitures, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly make cash to repay the 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of the US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders to a due proportion.
Analysis Paris Session History Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange suffered a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank bailout plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching the 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dived from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the largest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index sold 199.61 points to 1.983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1.106.55 points, according to final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the bank bailout plan that was intended to restore some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives refused the Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this plan," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would come "too late".
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the relay will be quickly transferred to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and to the other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, Chief Economist at Global Insight.
And emphasizing the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings down a financial institution" in the United States, said Piegza.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities organized the takeover of Wachovia's banking business by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis," added FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill fell to 3.632%, compared to 3.827% on Friday night, and that of the 30-year-old at 4.161%, compared to 4.357% the previous day.
Obama, winner of the first television duel
In the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates succeeded another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign HQs have proclaimed their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honourable, has not been "glossy enough" to allow him to halt his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% vs. 44% in McCain), considers that it was the Democrat who pulled his pin out of the game.
Among the undecided voters, who mattered, Obama won for 39% of the polled, while 25% of them gave McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance Thursday with the good performance expected of his packager, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain has constantly highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "naïvety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he said.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican television advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembly, he was concise and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, so," said this weekend, a democratic spot accusing the Republican of not taking full measure of the impact of the crisis on the "street American".
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama, yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a beating rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers."The financial defeat clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a decisive turning point," said yesterday's influential Democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes by 95 per cent of the Americans despite the sobbing of Wall Street, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that achieving the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates avoided questions about the $700 billion financial rescue plan (€470 billion) adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "you noticed there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative elections.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations in the central square of Minsk closed in protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislatures.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit they didn't even vote: "What's the point, because they'll do what they want with my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good for foreign observers with the aim of resuming language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic turn.
Sanctions, including the ban on visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers to be clean.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept out of the election commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the recount," lamented Yuri Potemkin, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the voices, and in our country, the executive power.
If members of the opposition come into parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter into the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must be initiated.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, enters into crisis, and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process may recognize the validity of the election.
She pointed out that the turnout figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the door to all manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election, you?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five members of the opposition in parliament, those who are best suited to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood Back Safer
Hema-Québec celebrated the 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood providers in the world.
Above all, he regained the confidence of the public, who had been seriously shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, the National Blood Reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were contaminated with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this tragedy and public grunt, in February 1994, the Government of Canada instituted a public inquiry, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations that such a disaster should not happen again.
While Justice Krever was slow to table his report, some provinces set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee has fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec started operations, barely 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and field work in the years that followed, we regained public confidence," she said, proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile".
From its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, Europe was witnessing the outbreak of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, tells the story of the fort that has held since its foundation in 1998.
"And we did not know at all whether this disease could be transmitted by blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain inevitably leading to death, exclusion measures are introduced.
As a result, in April 1999, people who had stayed in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 were refused blood.
A few years ago, it was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has shown us that the precautionary principle that has been applied makes sense."
In 1999, a much more sensitive HIV screening technique appeared on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which allow the presence of the virus itself and not of antibodies against the virus to be directly detected in the blood of donors, on which the tests used so far were based.
The NATs have helped to shorten the silent period, which extends between the moment the person was infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This has substantially reduced the risk that some donors will be infected without knowledge and that they will not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, it means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission through a blood product occurs.
I believe that you can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover your health," said the Chief Executive Officer of Héma-Québec.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen will emerge in the system.
As soon as last year appeared on the island of Reunion the Chikungunya virus which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant," says Dr. Décary before pointing out that, in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient supplies.
"The need is increasing because the population is ageing.
Since cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need red blood cells or platelets to recharge.
The aging of the population also has consequences for the blood donor network, which has an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
However, any healthy person who is 18 years of age or older who meets the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have travelled to a malaria-affected country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With this 3%, we manage to maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But the members of this donor network must be renewed as they age and can no longer give blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to restrain them and encourage them to become regular donors.
Since today's life is so frantic, we rarely find time to spend an hour giving blood," says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only supplies blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered a biomedical waste is full of stem cell-rich blood that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago the banking of our thousandth cord blood sample and we plan to collect more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing for transplants early next year," says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed to be unable to access it," because Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - Impact in the semifinals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semi-final round of the playoffs in the first division of the USL, thanks to a 3-1 win (4-3 total goals) at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday, in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series in total goals, at the Saputo Stadium.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half without a goal on either side, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the other nets of the Montreal team.
Roger Levesque was the only one to defeat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that in the first game of the round-trip series on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at Starfire Complex in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will beat the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still won the 5-4 semifinal round in total.
The Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Victorious goal of Kovalev
The Canadian's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn moderated the attack in a 3-2 gain from the Canadian to the dam shots against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in that win, the fourth in the Habs in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable."
"He tried to do too much in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a good ovation."
Charest bet on the North
Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon in Quebec City yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to be elected in today's by-election.
"To push the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the main lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was projected a sort of image mill.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Major assets, as in an election period.
At the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would call the elections this fall, even though he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, merely explained why the North was "a gem with immense potential", but did not give a deadline, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydropower, the forest, but especially the mining sector, boosted by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "Territory twice as big as France", "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as if to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built much in its relationship with the North, he pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Québec has always claimed, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate this position on behalf of the government," he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Péquiste MP for Ungava), have already started consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "we will give ourselves a common vision".
The development of the North would be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerted, ordered and respectful of the environment," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of the Liberal prime minister who preceded it.
"Like the Liberals who preceded us, we thought differently to turn the challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of Jean Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Centrale en Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa who made James Bay, our party has been able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
As a press point, he invoked another reference, conservative that one, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest noted that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It stays between us there, but I plan to be there," he told his activists, praising their applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and no doubt not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting an election this fall, as the law allows him.
He points out, however, that his schedule is fulfilled, notably by a mission of the Council of the Federation in China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the outline of the North Plan was welcomed with skepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, emerged from the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, abandoned its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today" commented Ms Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that takes place today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ expressed support for the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from a holiday today.
Letters - A dishonored country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in Harper's cabinet, who allowed herself last summer to say to Louise Arbour that she was a "honest" for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has waged an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration says so much about the Prime Minister's entourage as about Stephen Harper himself.
We are in front of a government that is the only one among all the Western countries involved not to have repatriated its national locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and allows a child-soldier to croup in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to a fair trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not matter to him that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We don't realize it yet, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," a word that Harper keeps brandishing and sounds so hollow in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist anymore: one can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the will of a minority head of government until now (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, she's here, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice President of Canadian Barrick Gold Mining.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has brought a six million defamation suit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house with the aim of launching a "transparent public debate".
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely obscured by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to lead to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable money to prepare their defences and to fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost bottomless pockets of mining.
The tactic in these unequal struggles is, moreover, often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will gag the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in front of the public that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is being done in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada normally take place through the exchange of ideas and not by batons.
It was therefore enough for mining to open its books, its files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support to the authors of Black Canada from the back of the hand.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could both ask for a "public" debate and disregard the views of the same public.
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word refers only to heavily paid lawyers, not all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public that supports Black Canada's authors and publishers do so primarily because it rejects the brutal manner of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag pursuit (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a formal notice against the authors of Black Canada intimating them to stop using this term...).
Beyond Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under penalty of repeated prosecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Black Canada.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the academic world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US$700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months still needs to be endorsed by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it provides for better control by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, and a right of control over the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
The U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and the ordinary Americans from the ongoing Wall Street crisis," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, the trauma, chaos and disruptions on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had sprinted in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a new failure would cause on investors' mood.
The deadline that had been agreed was the opening of markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential election, who were late in the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, but they were not afraid of being forced to reach that end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama agreed with the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, such as the one to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the one on the salaries of executives of state-survived companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no reason to welcome them.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on American television.
Asked another channel about whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The broad lines I have read show that this is something that we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of not doing anything is simply not acceptable," he said.
The $700 billion plan is designed to buy back with taxpayers' money the doubtful, risky and unsold debts of U.S. financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis triggered by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of mortgage loans at risk (subprime) before extending to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and leading to a liquidity freeze and the debandad of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who had overturned the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that this impasse has emerged since the Democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty should only be insured by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round out the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to assume losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its bet.
The new plan provides for a first instalment of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion may be added if deemed necessary by the President.
The payment of another $350 billion is expected to be endorsed by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get stakes in the rescued companies that will pay him dividends in the event of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure procedures for housing related to the real property loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on compensation and severance payments to the management of the affected companies.
The plan's architects would like to see it put to the vote of the House of Representatives today, and of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Votes continued yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic sides.
"Evidently, Washington does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, at the address of his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one of profiting from taxpayers."
Speaker of a small group in Congress known as the "sceptic caucus", Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize laureates, wrote to us to tell us: Congress is being asked not to rush and to look carefully at the way ahead," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was refusing to acquire its competitor in the midst of a shipwreck since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion US) in the crisis of risk mortgages in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savers and households now appreciate that times are forecast to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed to be nationalizing another bank that had been undermined by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of the loans under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to be nationalized by the British government since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his asset card, some will say his weakness.
Had he released himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensibility, and a talent that flowed from the source have also removed him from the register of power that brings forth the true sacred monsters.
But what a great racer in the background!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at the age of 83, from lung cancer in his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the fat years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and of which he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and bursting of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without disproportionate ego, the ultimate quality brand.
For in him there was a whole country fond of the self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific War, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied drama at Yale and then attended the New York Actor's Studio, before triumphing at the theatre, on television, soon at the cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who placed second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, coupled with a sex symbol, albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappear with him the shadow zones of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the brilliance of the show business, whose enigma we will not quite have pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's disappearance brought vertigo to the cinematographers this weekend, as his great roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of an ever-changing seventh American art unfolds through it.
The charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a fire roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958, came back in memory.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all of his promises.
So many more Paul Newman have moved on to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This friendly brawl in the brilliant The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar for Best Film in 1973.
A bitter billiard player and avenger in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he took over the character on Martin Scorsese's return to The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the ages, it was him.
He's still here.
The epochs are shoving through his path.
Young people know him mostly through George Roy Hill's cult Slap Shot (1977), Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as sponsor of the Irish mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
Against several film legends who left the trade early enough, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its fascists and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to "underplaying" considering his performances too supported.
The profession was not always tender for the handsome Paul Newman to whom the roles fell long cooked in the beak.
However, he played less often the young first than the marginal: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the drifts and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed poorly known facets of his true modesty sensitivity.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a fine female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the rain of tributes yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former companion of arms Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating features of the disappeared actor.
Beyond his legendary career, he also wipes out a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protestor of Hollywood's drifts.
We've seen a lot of his binocular sitting on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of quite bad taste, though gag at the beginning.
However, the profits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter with these phrases: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to have followed the journey of an American artist so lucid and generous.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company manufacture well in their invoicing factory?
In the near future, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are charged with fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, which has caused particularly serious damage, and other charges have been brought against them, such as false charges and the use of false charges.
According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and the municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand in the caisses of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, which was also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect the money from the grants obtained by issuing invoices for costs, behind which no actual services were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they obtained invoice books at the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that would appear on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours to the northern province of Lake Balaton, conducted by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he was to locate boarding houses and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices which they would introduce, among other things, from the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as from the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András 的ri, who, according to our information, was mainly responsible for drafting the files necessary for obtaining the grants.
During a "tracking circuit", one of Lados' choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up on behalf of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will later bear the name of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three bedrooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
The issuers of over-imagined invoices also fell into excess when they mentioned Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. In their accounts, neither Jobb Jövőért nor Hoppá's name appeared, according to the information given to the prosecution.
Győző Farkas, the company's manager, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecution summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond the form, the fact that, according to the bill, a hundred people lived there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much room.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The issuers of zealous invoices also did not inquire about Budapest's travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but only organized trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on invoices to be paid in cash, which also runs counter to the Agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the survey, they also added VAT on these documents, while the services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices drawn up in the name of Hotel Revfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services did not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Moreover, the hotel's employees only issue printed invoices, while the false ones were written by hand.
The investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes by mentioning as a service the transport of goods by road, which the company issuing invoices could not exercise, since its profile was the investment advice.
Moreover, it is also for defects of form, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved to be false.
Just as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehertó's sports internship, both of which deny being the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The counterfeiters also paid no attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to have a meal at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Invoices drawn up deliberately
Another category of invoice issuers is that composed of those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The foundation Esély Budapestért Alapítvány, at the request of the group of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, has drawn up an invoice to the order of the foundation Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the manager of Collab Kft. was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, it cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány Foundation, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyő Egyesület, for an amount of approximately HUF 5 million, but after which no benefits were actually provided.
There was no financial movement either, since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the organizations avoided mentioning them in their accounts.
The following category of companies issuing invoices is that of companies directly linked to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the managing director of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the business of fuel and motor vehicles, whose head office was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of IT equipment amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov also sent documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he seized their value.
It is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies were operating, which the accused explained because they were not getting work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused and editor of the founding documents of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, at the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov has given organizations a total of 15 invoices issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution thought that 10% of the sums shown on the invoices as well as VAT went into Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to draw up fictitious invoices that were used in the context of Biztos Pont's grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted a grant application to the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They received this grant for an amount of twice HUF 500,000, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search in the office of Árpád Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of making the invoices, as she had already done before before before the prosecution.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil over the whole story.
So far, his confessions are not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the least details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or if so, the Socialists would have reached an agreement that in return for the repayment of a large part of the HUF 50 million, Zusi would be the sole one.
Today, the latter is probably upset, as applications for his house arrest, based on a reduction in his conditions of detention, continually fall into the ears of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unrepairable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the proceedings. He does not have this possibility.
The psychology of the overbidding: why are we spending more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the goods.
Neurology and economics researchers at the University of New York have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distracted in this type of competition, such as an eBay auction, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, while the other group took part in a play auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which was the overbidding of a third, the whole under the brain stem, called striatum, moved intensively during the loss of the game.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "self-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
That is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers have pursued financial surveillance analyses.
In these cases, three groups were outbid by a partner in various circumstances.
They simply informed the group about the real value of the product in question, and thus made their payment.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they would win the game, then they would receive an additional $15 as a reward.
While the third group received the $15 before the auction, the group members also lost the money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was on victory in one group, while in the other, on failure.
By proving the neurologists' hypothesis, the players' team members "against failure" were willing to bets higher than those made by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
Indeed, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade in front of the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by leading, now, to a third explanation." - found Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred miles of the hepatitis virus-carrying patients in Hungary, but only seven miles are being treated. This is due to the fact that often patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to liver infections caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogenic genes, are spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g., contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended that they be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no C vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by poor general condition, weakness, stomach aches and nausea.
Then a visible yellowness develops on the skin and on the white of the eye, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die of the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients is receiving medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogen causes a sneezing destruction of the liver cells. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
As a result, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users, and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million patients with chronic hepatitis C worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating physician immediately upon observation of symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, in this way the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to chronic liver cirrhosis, caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience by analysing the degree to which belief in God could influence tolerance to human pain.
As part of this strange experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshocks, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a technique of palpation of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academicians, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment takes place in the following way: an instrument emitting sparks and disseminating electroshocks is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look in a sustained way at two paintings, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady with Hermine painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers at the origin of this experiment hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary would evoke a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four parts succeeding each other, while looking at either the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics declared that, in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt like "safe", like someone who was "cared for" and they "calmed, and peace invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious theme, they reported 12% less pain than when they looked at Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, believes that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided that the appropriate photo is found.
"We should find an image against which they react very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, praised the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually changes our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if we showed believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary lead to better results?
You're what you're divulging about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found at the bottom of people's pockets just like the sky over their heads. It knows where they spent their vacations, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
Yet it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While with regard to the skeptics establishing a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to be able to meet their original objective, which was to: "Let's collect in a system all the information in the world!".
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global sham work, they are still only at the beginning of their goals to be able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be there in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would best fit me?". However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, on the day when they know enough about the users.
It is not perfectly clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer launching the search, and the pages then viewed by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can consult what they've been looking for, what they've clicked on. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services to us on the basis of our previous declarations and registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he looks at what my job is? Ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can generate fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly revolt against power that can provoke counter-reaction among Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that the terms sought are not only registered, but in justified cases, they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases, nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most resounding example of recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google transmitted to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights-conscious Internet users were able to sigh a sigh of relief last May, when Google, with the electronic legal protection agency EFF, proved its right to court in front of the FBI. According to the ruling, in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the constitutional issues to disclose information about the FBI's secret request, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But ultimately, it fails to obtain the search lists of private users, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is falsified by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their private sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational companies proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, American geek culture and its "wildlife" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the "wired body," as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, who is catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for ID code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continually refreshed, has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, faced with the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that geeks see very accurately the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what the web 2.0, the most widely proclaimed key word of recent years, draws right behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, than the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind us, and that we use the channels of communication at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential thing remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can keep a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, which are related to his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can see many examples, such as the one of the girlfriend who easily understands in view of the morning photos taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or the one of the company that fired one of her employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be sure of one thing: the term privacy is totally to reconsider nowadays.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how one can define the principle hiding behind the behaviour of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to bypass Google's monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but, at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not least. Google's online services, including word processing, image processing, reading information, can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge servers and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed to date.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its present value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threaten advertising agencies' revenues, while services introduced at an ever-increasing rate are causing serious migraines not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, besides all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management refused, in its entirety, the employees' protests, after it doubled the price of business kindergarten and after the company considered the daily multiple restoration to be too expensive, taken at any time. All this seems derisory in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project takes on such important dimensions that society will soon find itself facing the US Supreme Court, others tremble in front of its Health system, because in this one, we can build a complete medical benefit from our results of previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian half-tons, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google's data.
Two miners helped remove traces of Ózd's double homicide
"The police summoned two minors to interrogate them in the case of Ózd's double homicide. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of the Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the charges against them, and for the moment they are accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect of Ózd's double homicide, a 23-year-old local boy, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed with premeditation and out of interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt and it was for this reason that he drew his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as the girl of this man, 9 years old.
According to MTI's information, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his crimes hidden at the crime scene is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Proposal to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kronor, for the acquisition of 100% of the stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish made despite the fact that previously the Czechs excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among the interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good new owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market specialists to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the papers would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with about 25 percent stakes, followed by 14.7 percent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their Tuesday's comments on the international financial crisis, which are growing daily, the leading newspapers in the European press are already referring to a "second 11 September".
"The global financial catastrophe, we owe it to the American president" - accuses the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The president was not even able to block with his own party behind a bill of law, improvised in the rush, aimed at helping a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11th.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the shortcomings of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system increased every day, and the whole world was going to pay the price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the congressional vote, there is a real danger, that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the vacuum, just as one of the greatest transformations takes place in the history of capitalism.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - underlines the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can still attach a lifeline to their titubant financial organizations, and with their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long run, we need the states of the European Union to ignore their national selfishness and centralize control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros - recalled the daily Viennese, Der Standard, who adds that the fears that European taxpayers too will have to hand in the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is passing through the old continent.
"Sauveurs" should not immediately brandish EUR 100 billion, but it would be wise if they noted in which case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Smart car mimics bumblebee theft
What method would be better for developing technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle, other than the imitation of an obstacle detector already existing in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at the CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave the strategic idea of starting the engineers at Nissan, to inspire them on how they should design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built a mini robot car, a bio-inspired self-robot control system, of type BR23C, which it has equipped with the qualities of bees, the ultimate aim being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own oval-shaped space, which in reality looks very much like our secure protective hull - explained, during the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the research and development department and public technological relations of the brand.
The faceted eye of the bee plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the faceted eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
He identifies the obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 meters in front of the BR23C, he evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which turns him into an avoidance manoeuvre right away.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it at an angle sufficient to avoid the collision.
Unlike any existing system at present, this avoidance manoeuvre takes place entirely instinctively.
"If this were not the case, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the time being collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in the blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can turn.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that the bees have to avoid the other bees, in our case, we could only use the rotary movement, the acceleration and the slow down as maneuvers at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses Lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentrate, making their lifespan longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should process and react to only a few incoming signals per second.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby a name out of price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout plan, designed to buy out the banks' doubtful loans, and to use them in several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of that money is going to be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of further debates going on until after midnight, Saturday, local East Coast time, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversies that have existed for days and days around the $700 billion rescue plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, according to which all that remains is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, commented on the compromise results that the program will work and be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here of the rescue of Wall Street, but of turning the workings of the economy in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets, Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., depending on Central European local time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in the name of the 2008 emergency economic stabilization law. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
In addition, the programme diverges from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which stated that the $700 billion had to be spent on a one-time basis for the purchase of securities for doubtful credits.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be delivered immediately after Congress passes the law, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Secretary of the Treasury to buy bad debts from banks, while the use of the extra $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The program will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase doubtful debts, securities relating to mortgages and doubtful mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The appropriate departmental officials stated that the buybacks may take place as part of an auction, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools at the origin of the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provides the necessary tools to spend $700 billion for the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the vast buyback of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of the system leading to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready for the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders in poor positions and waiting for state aid can expect their severance benefits, simply referred to as the Atlantic golden parachute, to be capped by the government.
Wage capping is mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat provides support to the company.
The principle of capping means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys back in an auction, they will levy an excess tax on the gilded parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly following the redemption of doubtful debts, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not overstated.
In order for the image to be complete, it is necessary to add that the existing gilded parachutes are not changed. The ceiling applies only to new contracts, thus motivating participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal limits will be in force regarding the support of the Directors General - commented the chairman of the commission in charge of financial benefits of the Chamber of Deputies, Democratic Barney Frank.
In addition, the State acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks involved in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even win in the business as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved fall on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit a proposal to Congress that will decide how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed doubts about this plan.
That's not why the U.S. citizens have mandated us, it doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, believes that they are the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise

The higher price levels of plastics and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in the petroleum processing sectors (1.4 per cent), manufacturing of electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other processing industry sectors recorded an increase of between 0.2 percent and 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which account for a significant share of domestic industrial production, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing prices showed the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices rose by 11 per cent.
Price reductions occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other processing industries, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the whole processing industry, prices have risen by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and according to the allocation of sectors, in August it was the sectors initiators of profit-on-investment that showed the most significant monthly price increase (0.7%).
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, while prices in the energy and materials-producing sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, there was the largest increase in the energy and material production sectors for further processing (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was estimated at 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-producing sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Export prices for the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent against the euro and 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that by 12 January the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force. That is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to the Commission, "now everything depends only on when the electronic entry and control systems across the Atlantic will be put into operation".
However, she pointed out that in the new system there will be no entry visas, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Cross of Commander with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of the presidential candidates, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support bank bailout plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major US parties, assured their support of the $700 billion government's bailout plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary of Treasury.
After marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, Congress representatives and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded agreements in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as more fit than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama again managed to secure a little advance. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a package maker just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote on the 700 billion bailout bill.
He stressed that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now that we must act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but not doing anything is not a possible way".
The Republican senator stated that the proposal referred to the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the capping of the severance benefits of senior leaders, and that he was personally very attached to those points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill on Monday.
Press review of the German linguistic territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only at the heart of the party that voters have become more conscious - this is how the Der Spiegel, the CSU's low score in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to govern Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this recognized political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took up his duties.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now it is these same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of era is at the same time the problem of the entire Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday came to an end a process that was likely of that, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU picked up at 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is to say at the time of the so much mentioned Stoiber.
The cause of this can be attributed to the modernization "despite one's parents", set up in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
The sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans from the north and east in the growing Bavarian region, could not remain without consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it is precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, the artisans, the holders of the baccalaureate and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, support for CSU fell below 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The party presidents stand on the reserve in the face of coalition questions", the Austrian conservative daily deals with the situation of the confused domestic politics that arose after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of SPÖ want to discuss with the ÖVP Conservatives.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The populist party BZÖ is open for negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during the debates organized on public television, party leaders barely let their cards see.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed his desire to discuss with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP President, as Vice-Chancellor, remains open on the part of Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the reds' proposals.
As he has already said, collaboration will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is momentarily a completely open question, which must be debated in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of the BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons for the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to the segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that most affects Roma children and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the people invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka warned that alongside the distinctions found during the hirings, the Roma disappear from the labour market, in the first place, as a result of their low qualification.
"An overwhelming majority of Roma young people do not have secondary diplomas, and as a result of poor quality elementary education, only a tiny part of them have the opportunity to obtain a higher education diploma."
Járóka also stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investment in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economies of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in as wide a circle as possible, also between Roma and non-Roms.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he/she increases his/her chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his/her income and consumption, he/she participates in the State budget.
"By virtue of their European Union nationality, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and be protected from low quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, an objective-oriented and action-oriented European Union collaboration is needed for an immediate acceleration of the school desegregation process. To this end, compliance with existing and in preparation anti-discrimination directives is of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and the unemployed must be broken and the opportunities provided by democracy must be given to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of their own right in the future of Europe" - Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit for Equal Opportunities in Europe, which has been held every year since the Berlin Summit last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination, both at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a Transition Period
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been adjourned.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still retain their place. The question is how long will grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic loss of 17 per cent of votes, will be on the agenda of the congress of the exceptional party, held the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair have, in any case, made it felt that they did not particularly care about their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the angry members of the fraction and the base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - that's true, still under Edmund Stoiber's leadership, at the top of his career - the social-Christian union won 60.7 percent, while today, a year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria's "single sovereign" giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still have a strong stake in this southern region, which is of key importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganisation of the party, the vice-president and the federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates discussions with the liberals of the FDP, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the government of Munich.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a possible putsch perpetrated by the Huber-Beckstein duo, entered into the legislation, and then treated without care the very ambitious municipal politician.
Now, the leaders of the CSU are putting all their energy into stabilizing, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far pulled the strings behind the scenes, will also be given an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some acerbic remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have deserved much more support from the brotherly party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel can once again be Chancellor only if they re-establish in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, hiding his disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of land of the CSU will not negatively influence the great Berlin coalition.
This, however, is relative because it will not be easier to manage the wounded CSU, and the crisis of the socio-democrats continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivals : 110 - 0
No opposition MPs joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is due to a country led by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is due to illegalities committed during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislative system in this country with 10 million inhabitants has been in very good opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in questionable elections, would "allow" this time the presence of a few opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, more and more economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order called anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive an entry visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit because of the shrinking imports of Russian natural gas, which is increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the company Beltransgaz, owner of the gas conduits crossing the country, passed into the hands of the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, in the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on one-third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday was already challenging the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present during the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. Russia, with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has already considered the two independent territories for a month.
"We took two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has begun between Belarus and the EU" - said Alexander Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this parliament which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent".
The opposition does not foresee any protest actions in view of the results, but rather tries to send its message on the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to have our opposing newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities put sticks in our hands in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of elderly people" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in Lukashenko's current regime, which considers social security as its main outcome, the most officially supported pensioner layer no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time," Milinkevich believes.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, leader of the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of the opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work".
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, did not have any rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But from today on, this new measure is in effect against the clever little ones, against who points and then goes to drink the coffee at the bar during the working hours.
The anti-waining novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The turning doors- says Brunetta- are an instrument to better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," says Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is complete with the Palace Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, says the Secretary General: "it is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or growing.
Promesse de Brunetta, which suggests with a smile, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution".
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
"In three months, the absence of sickness of public employees has decreased by 50%, i.e. 60 thousand more workers in one year".
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, " whose wage dynamics- explains the minister- over the last 8-10 years have doubled compared to the private sector, and well in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees, united to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using Codacons.
"while the Minister of the Public Service today spreads the data concerning the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace due to illness- writes the association of consumers- the people of the "active lazy" continues to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration, gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in the Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of the sick worker's permanent residence, during which the check visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions requested by the Minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirm that white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To get the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, the Anmil is celebrating today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Workers' Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the topic of prevention in the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, during a message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Invalid Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continuing efforts of associations to promote prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the raising of public awareness.
"naturally indignant, everyone has punched with a fist to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, arouse the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and obliges all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly".
The accident data on work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths being impressive," stressed the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli later.
"We do not want this "trend to discount" to be reflected in fact, in a minor attention, for it is precisely when attention relaxes, that tragedy happens.
"we believe that, in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be achieved through multiple actions."
"According to us- pointed Mercandelli- more checks and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on worker training, and this, from school onwards."
- He added that there is still a need to make an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Merandelli then denounced "the gradual deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for the victims of work" and the "disadvantage of assistance towards which the system has been moving in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give back to the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 reader pointed at, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which, in a press release in Brussels, quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"from this scientific report- let us read in the note- it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and week, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who frequently use mobile music devices and full-volume mobile phones can unknowingly damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data- continues the person in charge- this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the Ue Executive- confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now discuss with the Member States and other interested parties what possible measures could be adopted to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100Db, but there is growing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to effectively limit these data using solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music devices, who listen to full volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the limits currently in force for the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for prolonged periods of time risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
In Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, at the new seat, behind the Thermes of Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission components will finalize the Rome Directives.
In March, when they are completed, the Committee and the Communal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, with a view to presenting in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there- would like to underline Alemanno- it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome for use by the political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No role superimposition, but only the desire to have a corner where to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her duties and then disappear, as this experience must have a precise time duration.
In June-announce the mayor- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the management of daily life and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see from the front, and further, towards a deeper foresight, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome wishes to stress that "this Commission is not a useless body or a bureaucratic whole: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the Roman city dwellers a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the Capital.
For Alemanno, "there is a need for a strategic outline, neither firm nor motionless, in order to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit. "
A future which, the Mayor of Rome says, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital, but also" in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, as a result of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on a website: "This person is ambitious."
Obama is really excited: he believes he will win the highest position of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In reality, these are attacks that do not say much; they are obviously attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have the polls, which all state that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the entrails of the southern United States, wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know well to whom the American patriot will give his vote.
This is the embodiment of an aspect of the American mentality kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things never revealed so far, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 per cent said: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back home.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take George W's place will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for the suppressions. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of newsprint.
Five hundred American journalists were arrested by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly say to the information workers, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a destroyed economic model crisis.
In addition, deletions in the newsroom, in the room where editors work on the assembly of newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that, according to the journalists interviewed, must be solved if traditional journalism as the general public hears is to be reduced significantly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong track.
Locally, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast publication.
Journalists don't have a hard time seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses were moving towards the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of newsprint.
The "economic pressure" that journalists feel is increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest jump in American journalism lies between those who run newsrooms-that is, directors-and reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is linked to "work safety".
Directors who think they are losing their jobs in the space of 3 years are 47% at the national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going at 30%.
That of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn 10 thousand dollars a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days in total, spent a number of years.
But according to their revelations, American journalists are often "bad" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL:TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTE IN GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second criminal section of the Rome court, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the case of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the Unipol-Bnl climbing instruction.
During his trial last week, he obtained the house release, which was converted into a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked the real estate agent to travel from the province city to a home in the capital.
According to the court, such movements (which the PM did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and to have access to the evidence that accused him.
The elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms it to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate soul East Coast, favourable to federal institutions as well as to business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington ones" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, which made itself felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, the great changes that the current economic earthquake is pre-announced or is already letting go: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not just here.
In both the United States and Europe, the crisis seems to speed up the incubated phenomena for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the revival, the extraordinary revival, of the two-tier sovereign state, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with foreigners, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families who live in a single country, in a single state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it governs: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears economically global but politically, it is almost only here national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of the question or has little to say: the obvious proof is given to us by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is unable to decide on any common political line.
And so, it is the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all an affection of credits: when we go through a difficult period, there is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources that can try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and legitimization to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements which no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose of in a similar way.
This new phase of the state-nation crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with the rather unmaterial things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but that are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more maps than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Which says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shadows.
And in addition, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of distance that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
Thus further increases the conviction of the various classes, before actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of the majorities.
In short, The demand for leadership, feeds underground, a powerful and ramified movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised "revolts" of elections or, in the collective moods of recent times, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, the fall of Labour in Britain, the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy has not happened by chance).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have ever more difficulty, which does not date today, in understanding and thus representing the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is strengthening, increasing and potentially agitating.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said, keeping eyes wide open, that is not without reason.
The superstick to walk on the walls.
Overcoming the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walking on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring only 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to hold a 100-kilogram body on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY- The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a pile of spaghetti." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have drawn inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal a perfect adherent.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "detachs easily from the wall" explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
WALK ON MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers are thinking of a much less fascinating use such as connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may involve aerospace engineering.
For now, no superhero.
THE OTHER RESEARCH- The University of Berkeley, California, is also dedicated to looking for a new adhesive.
In an article by the American Chemical Society, Californian researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibres like hair, which self-cleansing dust during movement on an area to ensure a perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Pay attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are thirsty and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter the absorbing amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, so associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he is launching a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized as being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological medicinal products to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - It was the Italian Medicine Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year newsletter, alerting doctors and patients not to under-estimate the danger of this mix and to pay attention to what is being drunk, if you are taking medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit drugs.
Long is the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are in general, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies who will have to change the information notes of the medicines if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines that are taken, and if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist," the expert pointed out to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times editorialist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A forecast that sparked many polemics, and which was criticized by the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom, disappeared from the attention of the public," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive divulgator, particularly critical of the excesses of liberalism in the Bush administration.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
This is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year's work by voluntary developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various new features: from the welcome screen, and the interface revised and less austere, to other more important ones, such as the compatibility created for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and the support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard ISO version.
Open Office paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some features specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduces the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphics module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that unite the typical chart of Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or text maker.
Collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts over changes, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some of OpenOffice's functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to deliver the final result.
The Italian version can be unloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also as usual available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be shipped to the home or to the workplace.
And if the theme of free can be a way to spread it in the houses, it is precisely in the business, that Open Office tries the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up towards business foresights.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the equivalent writing video of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the competing presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, like the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reach 5 million download, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, we can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, this is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity in the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the site of the daily L'Equipe that reports the news.
At 26 years old, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in the Cera, the third generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests carried out on Kohl's test pieces are among those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity of the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to expect two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the Austrian authorities of the positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed himself on the podium behind the Spanish rider Carlos Sastre and the American rider Cadel Evans, taking the polka dot jersey of the best climber.
IMMIGRES:NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS IF ITALY IS RACISTED?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reluctance.
Would that turn the Beau pays into a nation of racists? That is what the New York Times dedicated to a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, a native of Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are both those where there is "more integration and more work", but also "an anti-immigrant feeling the strongest in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not just.
Even the new legislature intended by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as proof of the change of climate in Italy.
Trend underlined by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Student victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market is not in crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support- explains the head of Sunia's study office, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the high demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of general increase has even begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: open-source contracts, unregistered contracts, rent limits, sub-rents.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax review are needed to calm prices.
Reading the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it ranges from 650 euros minimum (Nere Bande zone), to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, and 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), we ask about 600 euros for a single, 450 for a bed in a double.
Slightly lower values (€550 for a simple one) for areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
We can save only if we move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a simple one in the area Predestina, Centocelle or similar.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300/400 euros, for a simple one, one spends 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the areas Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, it is necessary to count 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, in which rents are often taken by extra-community students, there is a subsequent anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is increased by 25/30% compared to that applied to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, cities elect historic halls.
Historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplexes.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image presented by the director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-salles, and the death of consumption of mono-salles in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places and filled with memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of road and so much emotion" observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living cinema, may be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: over the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and it is the rooms of the main cities that have paid the costs: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Romaine Emilia is in the lead with 82 single theatre cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that confirms that the first person responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-room cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagna.
"Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way," observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but we should still guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, these frequenters are not necessarily all willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the failed deliberation of credit in favour of traders: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not comply with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city which, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the single cinemas of the historic centres and on the outskirts.
Among the planned standards, there are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking spaces.
"It's an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that to contrast the super power of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that for me, has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New cinema Paradiso" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have experienced so much shared emotions, I turn on the other side not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and ‘ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the City Council's choices to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
Heavy charges have been laid against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiaione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external competition for mafia association.
The controllers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, homonymous to the boss, already sentenced for association of mafia-type criminals, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to enter officially within the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration"
The president of the Calabria regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andrangheta, heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, the communal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of the alleged conditioning between organized crime and the local administration, the local politicians had been discharged from their function of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a right center coalition, after the slamming of May 2006.
He cried out to scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating everything for a political question, but in view of the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromalli clan had even managed to ask for the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is emerging "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromalli, standardizing the choices of the public administration to the interests of the clan.
When the energy is born from the waves, now the bigs are launched.
This is a huge deposit that occupies more than 70% of the world's surface area and now the world's major energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colossals like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now are trying to get their hands on them.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea has now been studied for a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil give a big boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the global electricity requirement could be covered by sea swell systems.
This amount would be twice the amount produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colossus to attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy was the Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an installation in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years from this, more and more candidates among these companies have always devoted to traditional energy rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying technologies on ocean energy- said the spokesman of a company associated with the American oil colossus, the economic daily Wall Street Journal- and she is assessing the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question concerns the obtaining of a deliberate permit by the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that precisely in Alaska, the Usa continue to extract oil, and recently President Bush has set up a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which travel the way of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate, according to observers, an increasing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts are talking about a technology that is still in its early stages, because marine energy does not dispel fears about environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create a major problem for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, it is necessary to use technologies with a higher environmental impact.
" And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The thrust of the waves, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine which, in turn, supplies a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
At this time, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing energy for a mall and a parking lot using six underwater turbines from the East River in New York.
The movement of the water during the tides, rotates the blades of the turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, deserves the potential of tides at the moment.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from wind, sun, or waves, and thus more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others, look to the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are planning investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
