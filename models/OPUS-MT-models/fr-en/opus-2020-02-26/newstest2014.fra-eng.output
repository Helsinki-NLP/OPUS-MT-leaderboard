Spectacular "wingsuit" jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination of wings), it went up to 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 metres above sea level, where many bastards had gathered to observe its exploit.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners find it difficult to find the money to repair the decrepitude of the highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that attaches itself above your car's dashboard.
The aircraft, which records all the miles travelled by a motorist and transmits information to officials, is at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and the government planning offices to overhaul the obsolete system of financing the major American roads.
The generally uninterested sector of the planning of the main axes has suddenly provoked a very lively debate and heated alliances.
The libertarians have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you are travelling, and possibly the road you are travelling on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party is sore.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while Congressional members are unable to agree on whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they will be able to move on to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental trip.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we have a choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state will start recording the miles travelled by each Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to increase the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a payment system at the mile.
"It turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative," he said.
Wonks calls this a user charge for mileage.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the urban liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state's ambitious laws on global warming.
But the representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
Fans of the free market of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of charging drivers a mile.
"It's not just a tax rushing into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transport Secretaries who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move towards payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have covered approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are making progress.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state kilometric charges instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one.
Illinois is trying a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with an aircraft, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their every move.
"The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who heads strategic performance management in Nevada's Transport Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full location devices."
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's daily goings and goings.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact place and time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company did not intend to assist motorists who pay taxes to the states.
It sought to break into the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have pleased the planners of the main axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in pilot programmes in some States.
There are far less expensive means and much less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experiment by offering different choices to motorists.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide "driving payment" insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits of the system," said a document on urban development.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate on payment in the mile is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes.
An additional one-off or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs at the commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unreleased Listening
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he has produced a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new David Bowie album had left everyone pantois.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he had said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last album, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few appearances in public, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to re-release this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he concocted a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, new studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five specially unveiled songs for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pouches, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with the lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new track Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very forward guitars and cleverly controlled rock electricity.
Unpublished ones already in tune
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a light cavalcade slows down gradually to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The bewitching guitar riffs make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man aboard a rocket, potential Martian...
He hides and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, by the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and noted that a transition process was followed by all soldiers prior to their return to civilian life.
Attacked by Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the "universal service" rule of the army requiring that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by La Presse canadienne, including that of a soldier who was released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before being ready because he did not meet the universal service rule.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that it was totally different than wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was any way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine how much latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not capable of fighting.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
The Liberal spokesman for veterans, Jim Karygiannis, on Wednesday called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice."
Disney bets on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney decided to focus on tablets over its own TV channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its worldwide launch on Disney's channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children aged 2 to 7, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she makes order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the life of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under the age of 2 have already used a tablet or telephone, and 72% of children under the age of 8, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the US intelligence services, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he has the right to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has obviously been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the US Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
Relations between the United States and Germany have been strained by complaints that the NSA has tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign intelligence services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it would have to be enjoyed.
Mr Ströbele, a German Green MP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele stated that, according to counsel for the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden testified in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, the Member said.
Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter makes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in a future that doesn't seem so distant.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options," said Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable follows suit with its competitors, like Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients do not currently have access to.
The telecom giant Rogers has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussion with some major cable companies to make its service available via their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the Harper Government's announcement in its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy large channel packages doesn't work," Audet said.
It hopes, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) will lead to interesting recommendations.
"These discussions will require a new kind of frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco p.d.g.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ per share.
This is a decline compared to net earnings of $44.9 million, or 83¢ per share, for the same period last year.
The Montréal-based company explains this decline in depreciation costs associated with new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, Montreal also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco's revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about the number of clients fluctuating in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change of trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
Horse in beef products
Horse meat has been detected in cans of beef products, sold by two small British retail brands at low prices, the agency responsible for food hygiene announced today.
Routine testing revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save chains, contained horse DNA of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the UK agency explained.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four injuries, early Friday, on Highway 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4am, a motorist driving north at Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and struck a car that was coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6:00 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for hand baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 to passengers carrying hand baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the descent of the aircraft.
The new hand luggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would charge $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to charge this price," she explained.
The airlines started charging the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as many things as they could in hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These charges are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley said these new fees won't really be used to raise money.
The aim is to make the most loyal Frontier clients understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their ticket from the airline's website will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger in queue at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag free of charge, while the next person in line might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and registration procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier's hand baggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Travellers often ruppet about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people in Wall Street view the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them did not pay for baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the surcharge charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand baggage costs were $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate when passengers discovered the company's unusual baggage charges.
"I had never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career," he said.
I expected to see a gnashing of teeth and a fight burst at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers boarded at the speed of lightning."
Frontier also acts as Spirit and charges $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier has indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be re-worked free of charge.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and no other major airline followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is his final effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors such as Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of from an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it started offering only half miles of loyalty to customers who purchased their ticket via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she reduced miles premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make it possible to earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home town, Denver, but his business is shrinking and she loses money.
Revenues declined by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results published on Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA is calling into question an "internal error" and not hackers for the failure of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that caused its public site to fail for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed on-line.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," said the spy agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the breakdown was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the failure of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
The cyber-tactical is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The once ultra-secret NSA, a time nicknamed the "No Such Agency", has found itself in the spotlight and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and international communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former disillusioned NSA consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has led to a lot of speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber-operation.
The Delta City Centre now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who would turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees down.
Employers came to meet with employees directly on site, and individual employees were interviewed to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Felix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he was selling it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for seniors.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens procurement project starts with zero employee"
After throwing the sponge in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site in North Amiens promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tirematician Titan, today declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the factory counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the plant's purchase project in January, you come back today.
You had pronounced violent attacks and insults, speaking of so-called workers, who "work three hours" a day, of "foul" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that volte-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr Montebourg is a charming young man who is trying to save some of the best paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when in other countries we work eight hours handicaps France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that manufactures good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with a correct price and skilled workers, it's worth trying.
What kind of deal do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered the employees a good severance pay, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buying the closed factory from Goodyear.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other EU country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
He wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan commitment before trying to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to secure an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were prepared to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he wants a four-year guarantee.
But, as I said, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant's purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr Montebourg succeeds in having the CGT and Goodyear agree and Titan buy the plant, we intend to stay in North Amiens for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit in decline, as aircraft deliveries and orders decline
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aviation and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and from contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not provide flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide any information to determine whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule by September of this year.
After the first flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
Results were not up to forecast and stock prices fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for stock market growth in the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the drop in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will register new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential savings of the new airline.
Currently, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft is put into commercial operation.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were planned during the aircraft's stopping time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and plan for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will occur throughout the flight schedule.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, while the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first client can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it was in the process of evaluating the entry-into-service schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slow flight testing – although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net earnings fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted share income remained unchanged at 9 cents.

Two speleologists of 23 and 27 years of age were reported missing in a gulf under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, we learned Friday from the Speleo Sauvement de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one experienced practice and the other not, had left underground on Thursday at around 9:30 p.m. to cross the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo rescue in charge of the organisation of the rescue.
Dozens of people on the spot
About 20 first aid workers, 10 civilians from the French Relief Spéléo, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information on to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted but not injured".
They got lost in the network, went back on their feet while waiting for help, said the prefecture.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of the first aiders in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
On Thursday, the German journalists' union invited its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google's and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice," she said in a press release.
It considers the Washington Post's information that the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected massive amounts of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two companies to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union, who claims 38,000 members.
Repainted lights: MP requests resignation of Brigitte Gruwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels to "relift" the poles of signal lights in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, Brussels' Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of painting 16 poles of signal lights from the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "the Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long term, to paint all the Brussels signal lights, at an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who speaks of "flamandisation" of the capital and demands the "designation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brussels people madly in relifting the signal poles in the colours of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations of Flemishization of the Capital", says De Bock in a press release.
After her yellow-mangue-black taxis, she finally repainted the Brussels poles herself in dark blue yellow-black.
According to the honourable Member, there is no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels.
The Brussels people deserve better than their money being wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels people," concludes De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis disassembled
The Pont-de-Buis ecotax portal, around which a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on site shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national was hijacked in the wake.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomuv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three ecotax portals in operation in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google-signed connected glasses.
They can purchase a headphone, a charger or a storage case.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of microfibers or an intra-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model with correction lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn't know how I would continue to "receive it".
There is no recipe, no instructions for using it to pass the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle awakening in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, placed on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his body empty, cramped on that hospital bed with cracked sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small day or night apparitions, a little shy, a little erased, it quickly returned to my mind, evolving as it resumed its place in the landscape of my thought that thought it was in mourning.
And then, it revealed itself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had in no way lost my mother's person but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her stay in life.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and liberated the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "in and out" sounds like.
I've always been told.
I never believed it back then.
I had a hard relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I quit smoking, when I was scared, when I was hurt...
He spoke to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, lending him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me alone.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I don't know who said dead people are not forgotten people but invisible people.
My parents are no longer but I feel them constantly close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said ? what would they have thought ? what would they have done ?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week is certain.
I often dream of the last moments I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me on the contrary and fit into my story and actually they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound, where I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamed I was waking up, I was hivin' out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he smiled at me and rejoiced that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, he was a little boy in my stomach.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in telling this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor who I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially in times when I find myself in difficulty, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested me in the Middle East, to the point of mastering it in a large school, have not been, with hindsight, anodizing choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would want me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a caring soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes standing on me.
My mother died 19 years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I went through all the phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, tears that trigger alone, anywhere, at any time, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed the pain.
Only the lack, the emptiness without answer, the need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the hollow of her sweetness.
Yet she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her anxious eyes resting on me, I see the dark circles weighing up her eyes, the lines around her lips that cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and saying his name is no longer taboo but comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little reached.
We feel carried and protected in difficult times, the retreat of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay on the path she had set for us.
If a being has loved you very much, absence cannot take it from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
In fact, I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep, and I always wonder what he'll think.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he'll always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk between us.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It is almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course diminished but it is still close to me.
Very often he "disembarks" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to see that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with such a real voice that I woke up in a rush, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and I turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a profession of responsibility, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was Iraq's deadliest month since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day on which the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to stand by us and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will expand, and what is happening in Syria will also expand.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They held signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocainoman's lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court
A great defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after having compromised himself because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by the criminals to be a "major case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32 years old, dropping three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a bar dinner with confreres.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this Class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
At the time, the four suspects were being monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for £1.5 million, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would be revealed in the open.
Today, at Liverpool's Assize Court, Ditta, who works in Blackburn's Forbes Solicitors law firm, fell into disrepute after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine in a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the depot, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drugs, and they phoned nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this Class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied use of cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the suspected drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from him.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that clients sometimes called him at home on legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he called major players in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of having abused his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we're talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this has gone far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He has been too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and has allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I had wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done so immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has moved from criminal to criminal as soon as he has begun to obtain drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has forever compromised him and made him vulnerable to the ulterior thoughts of the leading members of organized criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and build confidence in the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this confidence and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The serious and organized crime unit in Lancashire conducted the investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last guest at dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be back on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin began recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness from which she suffered, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on 16 October that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas illuminations
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers by sea covered with a coat of light: one could approach the hot blow in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice which, unlike many municipalities, is also paid by taxpayers, not by trade associations.
To alleviate its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at the Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, there were at least two injured.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the perpetrator of the shots.
The incident would have occurred at Terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or to the tarmac.
Very quickly the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of a parking lot at the airport.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynetes imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will come back with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room full at the Pulperie of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities, the Lyric Apéro, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a benefit activity, along with the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as a bat's air.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is well established, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"Finance is running high and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operator, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would even say beyond," said Hélène Gaudreault, Executive Director, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons for a dangerous purpose, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet in a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for class action against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for class action was filed against the St. Croix brothers, concerning sexual assaults that took place this time at the St. Joseph's Oratory, as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the applicant's testimony, identified as "J.J.", which was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Submitted, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint Joseph Oratory, where he was serving as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first remedy was for only three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both cases.
The particular feature of the class action that has just been filed is the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been committed by members of the St. Croix congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together complaints from 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the St. Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Sainte-Croix Congregation and the Saint-Joseph Oratory, which is a separate entity, "have allowed sexual abuse to be perpetrated against children", that they "have exercised moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims", that they "were aware of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless suffocated them", and that they "scientively and consciously chose to ignore the problem".
These latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer of the St. Croix brothers, Me Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on research in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix, who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage, the hearings on the merits, is carried out.
In the case of the first recourse, the congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle the matter amicably before hearings were conducted on the merits.
Significant fire in a trade
A fire severely damaged a trade in the district of LaSalle, in Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescue was called around 1am on Friday because of a fire that had declared itself in the basement of an Indian cooking restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
About 30 firefighters who were sent to the scene took almost an hour to control the fireworks.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the Chief of Operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly 20 units, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may need to be accommodated temporarily, the SIM said.
Much opposition to medical aid in dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Palliative Care Congress, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to ease their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokesperson for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
With a focus on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would become minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, felt that the service would be useless anyway.
They never ask us, "I want to die, give me an injection."
Rick Firth, Director of the Association of Hospice Palliative Care in Ontario, believes that Quebec's bill disorients the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will follow suit.
For her part, the Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of end of life would have to be clarified before the bill was passed.
Kenyan press outrages controversial media law
"It is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" the newspaper said by contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent news and radio stations.
He said that the new media court "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the Speaker will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and refer it back to parliamentarians," he added.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will allow the government to "take control of the media." The Standard said that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had been hit hard" and slammed the bill calling it "draconian."
The passage of the bill comes along with a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate mall last September.
The Kenyan media have aroused the anger of the authorities by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly hijacked the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to interrogate them, although the summons was withdrawn following the lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media will be liable to fines of up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "de-registered" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid the fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere".
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at The Nation, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Delivered to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission in charge of wages and restored their mirrobolizing wages of about 532,000 shillings per month tax-exempt – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a great deal of emotion to the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé during 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself seriously understaffed.
Almost 30% of the required staff was missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
Troubleshooting was not used, Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the level establishment have been streamlined or reduced, as long as things are moving in.
We certainly worked hard to interest our young [pharmaceutical residents] to come and stay here.
There's a contest of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 will be much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Three pharmacists have already returned to work after their maternity leave and three more pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain were successful, as the four students currently residing in Laval also decided to remain employed with the CSSS.
Now it's going much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will therefore fill our departures from last year.
Still growing needs
However, the situation remains difficult.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as those experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is still precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancy, we almost always go to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to do replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career at the cinema by the door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), erotic memories of a quadrennial who has been addicted to sex since her teens.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her elder is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on icy paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he had recourse to professionals of the X for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing her actresses into their last cuts, always for the best.
Stacy Martin's not done making her talk.
A room of the Narbonne RMC evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling at the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the manager of the facility had the room evacuated and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
About 70 people came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on a tear gas jet background?
Or involuntary incident?
Still it is that the management of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything came in order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween Day, a woman tried to bring in two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins on Thursday morning at Montréal-Trudeau Airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's baggage that the drug was detected.
Cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had previously been emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman came from when she was intercepted.
It's part of the investigation," said Jacqueline Roby, the CBSA's spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau Airport have conducted 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1653 seizures of narcotics.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 ground-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances almost identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont ground-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation that Washington was revealing the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", falling into the category of speculative investments.
It is accompanied by a negative perspective, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again within a year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign currency to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the repayment of foreign credits.
These reserves, which the authorities rely heavily on to support the local currency, the hryvnia, falling, the agency finds increasingly likely a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious about Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had experienced its fifth quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, with a budget deficit, has been seeking assistance from the International Monetary Fund for months, which granted it a credit of $15.3 billion in 2010 and has released only $3.4 billion for the time being.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by raising gas prices to the population.
Following a new unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF noted this week that "important external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability", while noting "signs of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect a short-term improvement".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections being scheduled for 2015, notes the expert, interviewed at the AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of opponent Yulia Timoshenko.
"Singing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, who fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for one quarter of Ukraine's exports, warned that if a free trade area between the EU and Kiev is established, it should strengthen border controls on imported goods.
United States green light for Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group today announced the expiry of the review period for the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announced the two groups in a press release.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period laid down by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary to carry out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on obtaining other regulatory authorizations and the approval of shareholders in both groups," they added.
Congolese army chases M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would hunt down the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven from the localities of the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which it had controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We will sue the M23 and accuse him wherever he hides because they are criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman, to Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa Government and the M23.
Squads are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, and in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the flight of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff has been redesigned and the army has moved on to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end", predicts a Congolese affairs expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
That would be historic - this would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group allied with Rwanda is present in the eastern DRC.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which strongly denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, made up of mutiny former Congolese soldiers.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali referred to the possibility of military reprisals following the shells that had fallen in Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be once liberated by the army," says a resident of this locality bordering Uganda.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," he added.
The tests carried out by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have been negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date".
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient was suspected of being affected, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed some 50 people.
Chevron, the second largest oil company in the United States, reported a fall in its quarterly profit on Friday due to the decline in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining down from the group's targets.
Its net income in the third quarter fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged $2.71 per share.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Because of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Thus the main competitor of Chevron, Exxon Mobil reported on Thursday a net profit in decline, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: the claim considered admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (SRSC) has been charging $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who are on school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is in a position to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contributions were claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," explained Ms Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and asked for additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, to talk to each other and to find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (SRSC) did not wish to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closing of the emergency room of the Hôtel-Dieu
Faced with the sling led by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, decided on July 10 to "decelerate the timetable for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies which will not be possible on November 4".
A formal request made "not to run any risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of the winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign a few months away from the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Even if, at the APHP, the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of 4 November, firefighters who provided approximately a quarter of the 40,000 annual emergency passes at the Hôtel-Dieu will all have been instructed to take 30 serious cases per day to the emergencies of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4th also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, the interns specializing in emergencies will leave room on Monday for five interns of general medicine.
As for the transfer of internal medical beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The emergency reception service of the Hôtel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is on November 4", assures straight away Loïc Capron, the chairman of the Medical Commission of Establishment (CME) of the APHP, who supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirmed Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to accommodate patients in emergency," he tempers, arguing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain on site, he also assures.
But it is the responsibility of the SRA to decide the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are being done gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or he was lied to," deplores the emergency doctor Gérald Kierzek.
Dismissed from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the sling against the reorganization project, he defined himself as a "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynic" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
"They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other emergency services in Paris could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly engulfed.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting at the Lariboisière emergency room.
At ARS, it is argued that 30 patients "dispatched" at several sites are unlikely to represent an "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both at the ARS and at the APHP, the "new hospital model" which has been in operation since 7 October and is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year is defended.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in setting up a "permanence of ambulatory care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnose," questions Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for the level 3 maternity wards.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the minister doesn't take any action by Monday, we're going to change the pitch, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet's team, Vincent Roger, a UMP adviser from Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Paris UMP were for the maintenance of emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we were to return to responsibility".
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, reminded France Inter on Monday morning that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would express her clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, her spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to the other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop the wiretapping of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to take over the NSA wiretapping affair after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the surveillance of the IMF and the World Bank by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
When asked about the subject, an official of the US administration replied: "The US does not conduct electronic surveillance of the headquarters of the World Bank and IMF in Washington".
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, he did not specify whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had ordered the cessation of these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at approximately the same time as the one ending the listening at UN headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved on Thursday a strengthening of controls over government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
United Nations welcomes new goals for poverty reduction
The United Nations will now begin work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been set up 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the previous day in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to "overstep national interests".
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to initiate and appropriate the process of setting universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, touring them, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a t-shirt marked "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered on the Place de l'Indépendance de la capitale on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
The Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by the Rhodesia governed by whites and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall back into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italie and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo have mutually rejected the responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo bastion, on 17 October.
Attacks on former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo's spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government makes Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But the concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that the Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease the tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"It's two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open university and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes won by the Renamo has been declining steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," Mazanga said.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the Renamo is, but it has carried out disturbing flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after the Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustrations about the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of abductions.
"People think that the people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and it's up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "models of lifestyle," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "the brute force does not weigh in the face of subtle tricks," while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases, far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated "a careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's great that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that authors and teachers are "overtly didactic" means that children "receive completely", messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything needs to be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a history rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and don't say.
One fighter from Hamas' armed wing was killed tonight and another was wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, which was learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were shot at by an Israeli armoured vehicle.
NSA Espionage: the United States is "too far away", admits Kerry
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the field of espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington confession in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I agree with you, as the President did, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this does not happen again in the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London where he was participating from Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his retransmission, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has at length justified intelligence and information-gathering practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled many plans for attacks, through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have effectively prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects ahead," the boss of American diplomacy argued.
And, said John Kerry to the Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak about this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
On Thursday evening he assured that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel deceived".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to swell this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR" and conducted with the British NSA homologue, the GHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from optical fibers used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has intercepted massively data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the American press claimed that the US President was not aware of such listenings, Barack Obama refused to speak on this subject, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services, which allegedly seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where NATO's allies cooperate with the United States and would not be aimed at Europe at all," said General Alexander.
And the controversy extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the Australian Ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of an extensive international spying network that has also sparked China's anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient Friday without its master asset, Swede Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is wounded, announces the Ligue 1 club in a press release.
The PSG, leader of the championship ahead of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this game of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker on it.
The press release simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he was suffering from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the deceased crematized
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 o'clock, a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris City Hall, is to attend and then explain her funeral proposals at a press conference.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in Ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, insists on the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence made to the loved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompani the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Approving Death.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
Approving cremation is for François Michaud-Nérard, general director of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to plan for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with an burial.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a strong attachment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one for their loved ones, whether they are religious (53%) or civil (24%).
73% of those who have chosen a cremation now want a ceremony to be organised.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For the past ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ash shed," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now propose masters of ceremonies, who proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to connect him to others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of Father Lachaise, since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have been reconverted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that Father Lachaise's crematorium has organized, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who were crematized during the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing of rats turns into a polemic
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
Given the urgency of the situation, the Director of the South Habitat Lands Office, proposed, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to relocate the couple and their three children to a new T4.
However, the family refused "for financial reasons" and the situation was blocked.
The case has grown in excess, says Joël Canapa, the Director of the Office.
Rats, they've always been in cities.
The deratization company carries out two trips a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, 64 interventions have been carried out.
The neighborhood isn't left behind, and the rats don't jump into the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a kid.
"We didn't invite the rats to our house," the father defends himself, who left his house to move to the hotel.
We are soon without money and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange ends in decline by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended in decline on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the decline of the dollar against the yen, damaging export values and the warning on its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix sold 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped by more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house preyed on by the flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-storey house located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
One might say that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the public, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the headliners emerged in Carolines, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," said Hirsch.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", an evening of comedy and music for veterans at the Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, just like the world of comedy.
Many of the actors participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional channels, such as shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of FXX's cheerfully lascif football fantasy) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the casting of the "Parks and Recreation" series, but she is better known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of this year's festival will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up actor, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land program called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the Town Hall in central Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that, when he was here, sometimes he would walk down an alley between two buildings and think to himself, well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come and live here.
Oil prices continue to fall and close to $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, while concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's electricity-intensive manufacturing sector is growing.
The price of the US reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in late morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that U.S. supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arriving on Friday, which show an increase in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, following a decline that had not been seen in the previous two decades.
The Brent crude, a reference for the international crude already used by American refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Denial of the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal reintroduced certain restrictions in Texas on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in this state which largely challenges the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who practice IVG will have to have an "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
Admission privilege is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a hospital health care member, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
Advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, almost 22,000 women would be denied access to these facilities.
On Monday, on the eve of the Act's entry into force, a trial judge had ruled that the provisions dealing with admission privilege were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who was running for governor, asked the Court of Appeal to set aside the trial judgement that was blocking the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has succeeded in a return to power, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show on the date?
Some 10,000 candidates ran to the hearings of this 10th season to face the jury: Maurane, the villain Sinclair, Perche André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favourite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored on this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows stir up a wide selection of budding singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Fortunately, some of them have found their account.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind the TV screens, the vocations of successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make people laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD control and search policy
On Thursday, a federal court of appeal blocked the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's screening and search program and dropped it.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the outcome of the City's appeal.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interview citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments regarding the application for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be removed from the file because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which it publicly responded to the court's criticisms.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search programme.
She appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered a pilot program to test cameras worn on the body in the areas where the greatest number of checks are taking place.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of those rejected after police control.
The hearing of the City's appeal is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This system of control and search has been in existence for decades in some form, but the number of recorded checks increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that mainly concerned black and Hispanic men.
A legal action was initiated in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a collective action.
Supporters of changes in the NYPD's monitoring and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and will be able to change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say that these changes undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the police force has been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the constitutional control and search practices, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Tenants must vote because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes into taxes at the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We have to raise the rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to make a difference in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 fireworks anymore, $4 to $5 million worth of land in case...
Go and vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say that's enough.
End of service for chef de l'Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all levels until he became a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande by way of Nicolas Sarkozy, including at their holiday places, and nourished an innumerable number of great people in this world in an almost anonymous manner, which he only breaks at the time of retirement at 60 years old.
The man with an open face, a degarni skull and intellectual goggles, born on October 24, 1953 at La Ferté-Saint-Aubin is the holder of a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from one castle to the other!" said Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has officiated, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the head of state or his companion or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
Don't dislike heads of state who displayed a relative indifference to earthly foods, "they're all greedy," gently denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "he's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current Head of State, who returned to the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: one must serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night ahead is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there are mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchens of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday night with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart".François Hollande came to greet me".
He said praises.
"His human side has come out," he says.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been at the Elysée for 17 years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the prey of flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was subjected to three alarms with the fire department.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are constructed in a close manner.
The burning house housed four housing units, but no tenant was on site at the time of the fire.
All in all, the damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have ruled out the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese released a few images of his next film, whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, was played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and take out your tickets.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to defy you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "long island stockbroker, who refuses to collaborate with the authorities in a vast corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man keeps parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excesses of any kind are the main words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
Looks like the movie lasts 2:45.
In the hall on 25 December, he will be able to participate in the Oscar race.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus pipe on an affair involving the then-executing Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, with hacking Pawlby's voicemail and "permanently planting in front of his door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man to love presenting history to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate the issues: telephone piracy, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says the opposite, but we say "Of course we do."
The rumours about an affair involving Clarke were first picked up by NotW's editorial office when a source, sexually attracted to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, which recorded pirated voice messages on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls where they were asked for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the oversight of Miss Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former interior minister David Blunkett.
The board heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was with co-defender Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks denied having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted having carried out telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraq's Prime Minister, in the midst of an upsurge of violence
The US President was scheduled to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of US assistance to combat the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in October in five and a half years, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, November 1.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations has a higher record with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences are increasingly deadly despite heightened security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shiite-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people were killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of US troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new outbreak while neighbouring Syria was in the throes of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men were shot in the street or even at home, and the security forces were also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has led to this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
Violence is at the centre of the talks in the United States with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end military engagement in that country, had provided an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased the number of meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectarian and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
China's head of internal security accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists on Friday of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, ran into the crowd on the famous Chinese capital square, a symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic East Turkestan movement of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by independent demands.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organized and premeditated," said Meng to the Hong Kong channel Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of Eastern Turkestan," he added, his comments being taken up by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighur origin and specified that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken to conduct a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with instructions to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide on the appropriate way to survey the parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: Army attacks last rebel fief
The M23's irreducibles, some hundreds of fighters, were cut off at an altitude of nearly 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and Jomba, two localities about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," told AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by phone around 12:30, according to whom a girl was shot and wounded in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have repelled the rebels a little."
According to this witness wishing to remain anonymous, the soldiers "done the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "sweeping operation".
There was a clear sense behind him of small arms-fed crackling.
From Bunagana, a political fiefdom and last strong spot of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting entered "a final phase", with FARDC "circumcling the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption on Friday of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army, the Monusco has not participated directly in the fighting, but it provides government troops with decisive support in the areas of intelligence, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, went up towards the front line.
They were armed with kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
Earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers assisted by civilians were loading a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over another machine pounding the M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila once again called on the rebels on Wednesday evening to "demobilize voluntarily" or to be disarmed "by force", but left open the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December with no results yet.
On the spot, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have concluded the talks, it remains only for Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed on the government side.
The M23 was born from a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, who joined the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated areas of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where approximately 5000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the UN, the movement back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo that had started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," told AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
It feels like the shots are getting closer to the people.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: French-style music stands out as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts were bound to be ridiculous.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the aureole of mystery.
Jean-Luc Choplin's arrival at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the deal.
Today, these two scenes handle titles like hit tubes.
The first takes over, this Christmas, its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle et la Bête" may well be one of the season's successes.
On the other stages, musical shows such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are in tune with success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Historys of musicals" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for success so hard conquered.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical spectacles" which evolve according to the producers' wishes...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a real story like in 1789, Les Amants de la Bastille.
Others are leaping back fifteen years on the pretext that you can serve almost anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
After that, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us relive the Golden Age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Awakening of Spring" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway to sing, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musicals, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these occupations in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, tours, Broadway, off-roadway...
The pool of talent is as large as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre intended for adults and not young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Proposing beautiful young men (often talented) at the forefront of a musical show is the assurance of a craze of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are cleverly maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very much expected when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise went up to Paris and was tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at about 5:30 a.m., in the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeileaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9:00 a.m., at the site of the accident, until the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause traffic jams as the accident occurred at the Hœyeaart exit.
Traffic could therefore be diverted by this exit/input of the ring.
A seriously injured child at an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares new assault
Children play on a carbonised tank belonging to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on 31 October 2013 in eastern DRC.
On Friday, the Congolese army was preparing for a new assault against the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the eastern DRC.
The objective is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, overlooking the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
All that remains is the hill of Runyonyi.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," the governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku, told AFP.
Mr Paluku plans to travel to Bunagana on Saturday.
It is a political centre and the last stronghold of the rebellion and is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23's unreducibles have been cut off at an altitude of nearly 2,000 metres on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation had been "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were injured, including one seriously evacuated by FARDC, adding this witness called by the AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not given any record of the loss of life.
NSA revelations increase company paranoia towards state surveillance
On a fine day in late August, a German police helicopter flew at low altitude over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Intelligence Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening stations and that the operation generated an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the Director of U.S. Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant who became a whistleblower, began to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia for state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that made the vase overflow.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and businesses transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data could be used for their mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, who represents German IT SMEs.
German companies believe that the United States is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to an investigation published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all of the documents revealed by Mr. Snowden, there is to date no indication that the United States has passed on industrial secrets of foreign companies to U.S. companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is not the right way to do it," said Hasso Plattner, president of the German software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let her die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock to some companies that previously thought that China was the biggest surveillance risk.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States are governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US members have renounced their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after revelations about the U.S. Prism Data Exploration Program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: "Our clients are asking us today a question they weren't asking us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been.
"It's been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of BASF's chemical producer company.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Company managers are generally reluctant to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been hammering the message that it is at least imprudent to recover a free USB drive during a professional living room or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board of directors, states that collecting mobile phones prior to board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its managers to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of harm to the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises may remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access," said the BfV in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to the economic spying activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) produced in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of having carried out acts of piracy of economic intelligence, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company felt that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French internal intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled in the gymnasium of his high school, believe that their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January stuck in a carpet standing behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
The investigators of the sheriff of the County of Lowndes concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old challenged these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think that it defies all logic, the laws of physics and the common sense," Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a bag and they were returned to them in a mortuary bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several important questions remained unanswered.
What's the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of "positional asphyxiation."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"A number of questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he discovers any evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to hand over all video surveillance recordings that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents stated that they hoped that the video images would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC issues advice on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the American Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government is publishing, as the number of school-aged children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States now suffers from food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness of child food allergies among faculty and staff, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine – the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used – to respond quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like something is stinging my tongue", "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tingling on my tongue".
The NSA case highlights the total absence of intelligence debate
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends in public by summoning the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and on the other hand prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande telephones Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the scale of American surveillance on all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart on the one hand the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and on the other hand a condemnation of the listenings of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on American diplomacy's analysis of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the eyes of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignant us of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Did France benefit from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The introduction of technological tools for very powerful interception by the United States, but also by France, for almost ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area France and the United States in particular have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information which are almost daily and which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the NSA's resources.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and in return - as has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French about other parts of the world.
So the fundamental issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope of theirs, and, ultimately, the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the real risk for the United States? A deterioration of its image?
I don't know how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have become tense.
Another effect can be more economical: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to American suppliers subject to American laws, and thus to the control of the NSA.
Finally, the vast movement of revelations by media around the world, which is helping to initiate a debate on the surveillance practices of intelligence services that had hitherto been virtually non-existent, could prompt legislators, including the United States, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "undetermined sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be attributed rigidly to them at birth.
Under the new Act, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter an "undetermined" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersex person reportedly said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that doctors have created, bruised and swept away.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersexuality being part of the group of the 60 diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovars or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersexed.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is best to use the best available information to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York psychiatrist and sexual identification specialist, said the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious illnesses that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without operation, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very specific.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is in general both at the same time and not clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in employment, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice-motivated crimes.
Non-compliant young boys now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or "third sex" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allowed her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will include a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for "gender theory" to be removed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
"The parenting role is stressful enough without additional restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's sex," she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And just a decade ago, the medical community considered the genre to be a slate, one that can be erased and on which one can re-design.
But now there are many who question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these children were born, the psychiatrist was not called, the surgeon was called.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He dedicated the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a sloppy circumcision to castrate him completely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him like a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn't," said Drescher.
At the age of about 15, he returned to be a boy and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some physicians "still repeat this model."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say "that they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors could not really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (SDD) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
Surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based not-for-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an "undetermined" sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we haven't seen what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal type," she added.
The German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should wage at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will "responsibility" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
"The law gives parents some latitude so they don't have to make hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This gives them time to do some tests and understand them, and a delay before registering "male" or "female".
Thus, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with which sex he/she feels the most comfortable – and that is something wonderful.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the ruling coalition as the Senate's vote approaches to derail Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader says he "closely intends" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, pronounces its removal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Security Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of gunfire.
Firefighters at the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call for "multiple injuries".
"The security forces are on site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while TV footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," a spokesman for the American Transport Security Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second one carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at approximately 9:30 a.m. local (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that Teminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The ASD spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately whether one of his employees was injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport were suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas operative in Gaza-sces
On Thursday, Israeli tank fire killed a Palestinian Islamist Hamas activist and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, after having been learned from health services sources.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army simply referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, which was dug at the border and whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's Campaign Considered Dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event in Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's highly anticipated 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday evening that the president's close collaborators had conducted "in-depth group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama in his re-election as his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of the Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, the former Secretary General of the Bill Daley White House, in order to assess how the replacement of the Vice-President by former Secretary of State Clinton might affect the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been kept fiercely within the Chicago Field HQ and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's close advisers – including Daley, Obama Jim Messina's former campaign leader and former White House councillors David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time the president was not in shape, and so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley referred to the examination as "cooperative," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a lot in finding out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on surveys and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was examining the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of any reshuffle.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President "was aware" of the possible change, the former Secretary General admitted that it was "possible" that Obama had known.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not answer definitively the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama did not know that Biden's eviction from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something incredible but we're still in the early stages in terms of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've created because the luminescence of jellyfish is worth four times as much as gold.
So every ball costs me about £140.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream fragrances such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation promises to be even more ambitious.
He added: "I really want to develop an invisible ice."
It's inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I'll find a way to do it.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed on Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning as he looked at the trees and carried out the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his musician hands that were cracking the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and to take him to their home in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we are city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many people the tremendous joy of living he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become a bit more sloppy.
Over the last two years, I haven't distributed a single candy and I certainly won't do it any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallant sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is the trends.
Costumes are expected to be $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk's space men will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most wanted disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my astonishment, they were not the only dogs.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed up in hotdogs.
When it comes to sweets, you don't smack.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion in candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's great news for the 41 million kids who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell us stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Manufacturers Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to figure out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They bear the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States, which generate about $500 million in recipes, according to America Haunts, and this includes these wonderful photos of you pissing off that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "beautiful head" style.
I mean, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to La Grosse Citrouille when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby pumpkin trend" started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these pumpkins and didn't have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend approximately $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that wilt gently on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more attention, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will internally create a bad bank with 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relationship with London and accelerate its resumption.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleansed it within three years.
RBS also stated that it would include a provision for the depreciation of the additional doubtful debts of £4 to £4.5 billion over the quarter, an entry related to the constitution of the cantonment structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would free up from £10 billion to £11 billion, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line on the past, with the government being accused in particular of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and 90% of the assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and the UK," Ross McEwan told the press.
Land Rover announces sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features seat packs and 6-point harnesses, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, the general manager of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The fans of rallying that join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are confident that this will be a new way to try different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is really going to be exciting."
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters came down as a reminder along the cliff to recover the bitch and save her from a certain death
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firemen were called to safely recover it while it was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable protruding of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately sought out their lost bitch and made a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following a serious accident.
At around 1415 on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and went down as a reminder to save Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical Relief Specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She absolutely did not move during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies later.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical Relief Specialist Peter Lau said: " Ruby was very lucky to get away with it unharmed."
She could have been seriously hurt or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified when I watched the rescue."
First I didn't think she was up there.
It was surprising to have him back in your arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
Firefighters have been amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall, but she didn't move."
Firefighters have been great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never hit Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He hit me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he " categorically denies having made advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who made an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, "Prism", landed in the first place of the charts this week.
Beijing challenges Turkmen Islamic movement
"The backstage support for the attack came from the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the boss of Chinese security agencies to a Hong Kong TV channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has identified a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of the same family in the predominantly Muslim Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, drove their car loaded with fuel cans against the entrance of the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40 others.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 as a member organization of Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic disturbances in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be obliged to join the European free movement zone in order to be able to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control at Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's wall.
Although Strathclyde's newspaper has indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the headlines (and this was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continued non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from Scots.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet, one has forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why exchange the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the major post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the Europe Project is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and released the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has been a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the straitjacket on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has imposed on its members exchange rates favourable to German exporters – which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are faced with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-à-vis Germany.
The only way to do this is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidise French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is an adversarial disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is rumbling, particularly in France, one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy in jeopardy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's far right party, the Anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, turning the socialists back to power in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single, anti-European anti-currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties make a good appearance in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-currency sentiment unique in Europe will become unified and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something more like the free "Europe of Nations" favoured by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope that it will make the eyes soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a small England area (mainly).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer Europe agreement provided that we retain our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – and should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the Labour League, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative/liberal-democratic coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging Earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's breasts and pubic hair start growing at 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr.Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring the parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," said Kaplowitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age was 12 and a half years, compared to 12 years three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has started to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual appearance of puberty, but it is considered "early" when the development of the chest is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something that a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution may justify testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first period and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can hinder growth and small size in adulthood.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with drugs but recognizes that "controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioural problems and the feeling for girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their menstruation.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period at the age of 10.
Even if there were signs and we had talked about the rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual media messages are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9 that links the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty appear to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," said Kaplowitz.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls with early puberty must be reassured that, even when this happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that was just beginning to resonate, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the French Cinematheque, had taken the Palme d'Or to Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have set their sights on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac turns out to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan's rich attire in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less relishing clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the juron pulled by the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He takes back replacements at the stand in the studios.
Without accommodation, he toured the sofas of his friends who would still like to receive him.
A documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrity, with self-destructive behaviour," said to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel with several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicentre of the development of folk music that would generate international stars" as wrote by journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then took on a documentary look, from the dusty 33T unsold music label inhabited by an impeccable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafés where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still operates by integrating a funny character who constantly crosses the film: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, a makeshift companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "grown up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country".
"My first lessons in music were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to "be considered good", "random can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves".
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He's never known the word retreat.
A phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times dedicated it as "the author of spy novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he moved on this trip with a walker.
Before Afghanistan, he had also returned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SASs published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 and 150 million all countries," he advanced last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Foch Avenue close to the Arc de Triomphe, the malignant eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 countries surveyed to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with a advantageous chest, carrying a pistol or assault rifle.
Inside, his serene altesse (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, an Austrian aristocrat and CIA contractual agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launched himself to the kits of all the villains of the earth, communists of the 1970s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few hard sex scenes, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never claimed to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, of the type Albert London, who went there and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS's father said "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of the AFP, diplomats, and service people I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonitory: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Damascus Way".
In "The Fools of Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command centre in this city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Cairo Conspiracy", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists who were based on the Malian capital.
I am not guessing, Gérard de Villiers defended myself, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he moved for a month behind his IBM daisy typewriter dating back to 1976 "all the pieces have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
On the walls of his office are AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machoism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have a great many readers.
Gérard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is no age."
He won't die and he won't retire.
No more than I do.
Aeroplaners quarrel over seat width while large controls are at stake
The dispute is raging between the major airframers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights, paving the way for bitter confrontation at the month-long Dubai Air Show.
The conflict concerns the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but whose space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its great American rival Boeing says it should be the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their two-engined long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders at the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The manner in which seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
The giants of aeronautics often exchange blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X should take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We recently realized what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?".
"Boine offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Airbus's commercial manager.
As eating habits change, people are growing, but seats on planes have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American weight from 40 to 49 years of age increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American size of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the aircraft freshly called "jet set" was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing challenges Airbus's figures regarding seat width and states that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also said that the study showed that the experience in the cabin did not depend solely on the width of the seats.
"It's really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business," said Kent Craver, who is responsible for passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more a question of having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft at an estimated price of at least $700 billion at market prices in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a per-seat performance in their latest long-haul dual-engine models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the aircraft configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boine is doing this to be able to set up more seats and make its aircraft more competitive in relation to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Director of Confort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft manufacturer.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial perspective, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors who travel around the world even take with them a meter to check the competing configurations.
While venturing to offer comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater cabin customization by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, experts say that it is unlikely that his call to the aviation industry to put in place a size standard for seats would be successful, but that he would be able to forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle's shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted against the compensation proposal on Thursday for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it tarnishes the image of Larry Ellison, the third-largest world fortune that has just been crowned by the victory of his boat at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group that he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May because of the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
In the 2013 financial year as a whole, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the stock market price jumped by 27.5%, overperforming the S&P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
New Nicotin Vaccine Could Eliminate Smoking Pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further tests are needed before starting the human trials, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothed," the researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines proved ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine for human use was completely safe, it could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the anti-nicotine vaccine, and that can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interesting but pointed out that much more in-depth research was needed.
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a strike by an American drone on Friday in Pakistan, which was learned from the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army and the militant movement claimed this time that he had lost his life in this strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security officer.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had begun with the Pakistani Taliban movement Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP).
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied that he had changed the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid have two restaurants and a café, after their expiry in August 2005, without a tender.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony from Mr. Tripodi's former Assistant Secretary General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government pressured for leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's businesses, which accounted for approximately $2.5 million per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of calls for tenders.
But he denied that he had changed his policy at the request of Mr.Obeid, who, Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to ICA showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr.Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Department of Ports after working under Mr.Obeid's direction at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheaty to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but anyway, it wasn't about that.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says official
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirms a military official in Fox News.
The person in charge did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has conducted air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authentic" test
The Government is currently considering the possibility of introducing a "authentic" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa while considering extending enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used in unskilled positions or as a hijacked means of bringing his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying that it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The overwhelming statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the line" and "jobs for Australians first" are an unpleasant return at a time when unions were asking for a protected labour market," she said to the Australian India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white people's work had to be protected – and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo to this historic artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be checked for "whether the job offer is genuine if the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Companies could also be required to report the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's terrified 9-year-old son went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said the project would "bring the UK together".
Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown said he was "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of constructing the London-North England high-speed link from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are facing a problem of capacity of our rail network.
But it is also a matter of developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "clearly" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to explore options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will decide together on the next steps."
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease the regulation of electronics.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but noted that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is regulated by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to expand the use of her entertainment system on board using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but stated that she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that she was currently in compliance with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, hand baggage programs and passenger instructions.
"As soon as an airline has checked its fleet's tolerance, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a rixe involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries are reported to be unfortunate.
The gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore's pawnshops take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
At a pawnshop at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga deposits a bracelet, a ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay her daughters' tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," said Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, became this week the third-largest pawnshop to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Pawning jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it is almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pawnshop lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawn lenders have the advantage of not asking for a credit check or proof of salary, and can release loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and low-cost credit fuelled by too lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to bridge the gap while their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing indebtedness of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest debt-to-gross domestic product ratio in Asia.
Malaysia is top of the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with rising costs, people at the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] seek to supplement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have led people to be quick to pawn their personal belongings to gain the cash value of their jewellery.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the goods pawned in the 200 pawnshops in the city state are gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn on Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has registered a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the pawnshop sector that ValueMax, an operator of the shop in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its Managing Director.
The company will finance them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million raised this week when it introduced itself to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have been criticized for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Miss Yeah indicates that pawning not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers mortgage property they already own, and monetizing their personal property does not increase household debt," she says.
Pawning is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed short-term financing.
The people who go to pawnshops are not only those who have financial problems.
Singapore's wealthy people also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see clients from all levels of society.
"It can be affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for business activities or investments, or small businesses that have cash needs to get through a difficult course," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth minister in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is accused of child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and at the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicated that Mr. Hudgins had resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, they must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and must not access the Internet.
He will appear in the provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred with a armband with the sgammy cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, as customers complained to the management of the institution that called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time it arrived, it had already left without a slash," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouthless.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you want to get attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to disguise as a monster, but it was difficult to know whether it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I have been wearing a black SS armband twice a week at Asda's for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining that I suffer from "mental problems".
$325M bailout plan for Tasmania's health care system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout for the valiant health care system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the government will not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent measures" to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, expected over four years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Parliament for Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgery.
2,600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataracts, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for non-reservation clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical executives, mental health services, and deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," said Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The government will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on areas where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the government provides services in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much "unless it is followed by a genuine reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
However, he congratulated the government for responding to his urgent request for assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal assistance plan will make a significant contribution to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," said Wilkie.
According to the state government, these additional non-emergency procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But Health Opposition Spokesman Peter Dutton believes that today's announcement is "a makeshift solution."
"The reason we're here is that the state's Labour government has removed $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
We can't have a state government that rips off almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in 300 million dollars, and pretending it's a happy day.
Mr Dutton visited Ms Plibersek to ensure that no dollar of the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel boasts a remarkable artistic direction and a careful reconstruction of the period, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced the boundless cruelty of one Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says surveillance agency
Syria destroyed equipment essential for the production of chemical weapons and toxic gas-filled munitions, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline of
1 November set by the Hague-based organization ordering Damascus to destroy or "make unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machines for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial destruction phase is an important step in the ambitious timetable to destroy the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights based in Great Britain.
The militant group, which follows the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, of whom 6,365 were children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad were killed, of which 18,678 were fighters of pro-government forces and 187 were militants of Lebanese Hezbollah.
Among the deaths, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country as a result of the conflict.
Al-Assad's troops have been fighting against the rebels, many of whom have been linked to Al-Qaeda groups in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not provide any details.
The fighting underlined the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission of ridding Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A OPCW statement, working closely with the UN, indicated that his team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and seen destroyed – all the declared critical production and mixing and filling machines."
She added that "no other inspection activities were planned at this time."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained were moved to other declared sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the organization Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the government of al-Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory said that there had been a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentencing of one of the Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the Bali attacks in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by a firing squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was yesterday sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass killing for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors applied for a life sentence, yet they could have asked that the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the manufacture of bombs, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the firing squad," Corteen told the PAA.
I have to live every day without having any other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11:00 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He sank into a coma in the aftermath of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "dead" three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have had the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where American forces will kill former Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bin Laden in order to re-establish links between the terrorist groups in South-East Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender," Corteen added.
Until recently, he laughed at the grief he might have caused others.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Ms. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal against his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not talk on their mobile phone – under the new, much-awaited directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the crew member training manuals and the rules for the storage of aircraft to be in compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronics on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Based on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices in the near future," the FAA stated in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not expected to turn them back on until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commanding officer gives his green light.
Passengers are expected to turn off their aircraft when the aircraft descends before landing and not turn them on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground bearings, the FAA said.
Most of the new airline and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said he was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we're going to work closely with the carriers for it – it will benefit everyone," said Glading in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room overseers" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and text messages or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was evicted loudly from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his aircraft while the aircraft was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
FAA can lift ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, stated that mobile phones were still considered to be at risk.
"Mobile phones are a real problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee established by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government authorize the wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo, argue that there are no valid security reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply as the use of devices has become pervasive.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of that time.
New airline aircraft depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
e-book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those who are pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's management loaded a Kindle e-book reader airliner and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has led to mixed feelings among members of the FAA Advisory Committee as to whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he thought the interferences from the aircraft were real, even though the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots indicating that aircraft may interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings in low visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling for common sense arrangements for travellers equipped with technology.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopter bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, which was found to be exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rail was mounted on a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was set back on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rattle was probably a wintering migratory who came from northern Europe and found himself caught in the midst of strong winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil rig.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water scoundrel was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring companies together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British entrepreneurs and asked them what they thought about Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 entrepreneurs, broadly representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions in Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional archanes.
When asked for their views on specific policy issues – ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key competences should go back to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area – 40% of the larger companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and even more so, our survey of entrepreneurs revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade and not policy.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that gives power back to the UK.
The stakes are high – to achieve a change in the treaty and better represent Britain's interests would make it possible to see a shift of 16% of the votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that renegotiation will be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means re-emphasising the emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama has not derogated from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of guest children in the White House Gardens in Washington.
Last year, the Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the partyers caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people took part in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" neighbourhood.
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I finally got to wear the suit I planned last year.
We're having fun, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the gas pipeline in Bulgaria inaugurates a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom's director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," explained Alexei Miller, General Manager of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, a country through which most of Russia's gas is transported to Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional channels, adds the Director.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into service in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
The island of Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, taking up information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode of the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their incomes depend 95% on London's generosity.
The Island Council unanimously voted in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the British Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would enable the United Kingdom to sanctify those 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it had the means to monitor them, which was not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to surveillance of the area, and there is no port where military surveillance vessels can be placed.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the ZEE of French Polynesia, neighbouring Pitcairn.
The FAA eases restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft – but it will still be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former Deputy Governor of Jilin Province in northeastern China was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million yuan of bribes, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Vice-Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and officials to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon posed a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intractable with the powerful "tigres" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former head of the CCP in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life imprisonment in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest positions in the state.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, an independent body of the party.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the New South Wales YMCA were charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: one YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel for the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but was not aware of the second case.
He also admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA was incorrect by pointing out, "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA was informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions during an audit of the quality of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management failed Lord's recruitment and failed to verify that employees were aware of their obligation to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum prison term of 6 years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings in children's safety.
Staff testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including Lord's staying alone with the children, keeping them in private, sitting on his knees, telling them that he loved them and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and who had requested training in child protection because she was concerned about her behaviour, indicated that she had YMCA Caringbah's head of children's services, Jacqui Barnat, who led Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General stated that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord blurred their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views before the council of the YMCA of New South Wales saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not relate to "reporting" by staff, and the board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA's Director General for Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excessive zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual abuse of children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University to the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, monitoring, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20th.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledged that his return was unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his opinion known on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the position of Prime Minister, Blair would have replied, according to the Evening Standard in London: "Yes, of course, but it may likely happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew that the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old child, win.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted during the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Standing against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a bit on the side in a casual way to scroll his 2-year-old pony Toffee around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural qualities of unusual dressage for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good ratings for her presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for her third birthday last March and has since trained with her Pony Shetland every day.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee are making an excellent duet."
They presented themselves to and against all, but both took the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in southern Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded it."
He ran all the length of the track and even though it seemed to be very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, he will surely soon participate in the manifestation of the Horse of the Year – and I'm sure he will make a beautiful performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they marched on the track.
They are looking for effective team work between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he really looked great.
A Chinese newspaper that issued a call "will be reworked"
A Chinese newspaper that issued a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is going to be redesigned, says a press regulator.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now, the New Express is going to undergo a "full overhaul," the regulator said.
The order of "redesign" emanates from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles about the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The drafting of New Express was disorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into those responsible at New Express and immediately reinvigorate the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a construction vehicle manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television station where he admitted to having published false stories for money.
"In this case, I harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told CCTV's public television network.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express issued his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several prominent suspects have recently made TV confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier in the year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate himself.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in dock.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of the two Charles de Gaulle nuclear boilers in mid-October, while the ship was at sea, was "safe for the sailors", but was not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, specialist in the naval defence, assures that its teams and those of Areva, sent to the Var for the occasion, "are currently intervening on the carrier plane".
For them, among other things, it is a question of changing a pump on the failed boiler room.
"Everything is being done to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle will be able to deploy at the end of 2013," DCNS explains.
And the National Navy certifies that "it does not in any way call into question the programme of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
Remember that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier came out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, in order to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small damage", confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the flagship ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great discontent on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a deluge of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to be completed.
Anyway, we've got no limit on our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to allow taxation to be very respectful of those who pay.
Any money taken away by force from taxpayers diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with sumptuous spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: a deficit cultural centre, a strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are unprofitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also unfortunate to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention to the transformation of the former Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such enterprises, but in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that fishing lakes and piles will continue to supply the city with clean water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large decline in the population, water use has declined considerably throughout the territory.
Not to waste it, the city will never lack water and the strict regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We've been run for over 40 years by a bunch of brawls with great degrees for most of them, and I don't think a sheep breeder is doing any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The American authorities described the 4-foot-by-three tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzaging on a length equivalent to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, United States.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They shall be sentenced to imprisonment from 10 years to life imprisonment if convicted.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth major passage in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the harvest of marijuana in central Mexico in October, challenging drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railway lines from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "notice of surrender" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden as a result of allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible remedies under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Embassy of Ecuador in London on 19 June, asking that country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asks him to report to a police station on the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
He continues to violate the conditions of bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, having unveiled more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
No more passwords to type to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho , even believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a universe as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and France alone, the National Commission for Information Technology and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified anywhere and at any time," said Justin Brookman, responsible for consumer privacy at the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques that will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are fingerprints, the contour of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people working on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
It is both a security - one cannot capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has been multiplied tenfold over the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we're doing research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
A unique and falsifiable marker, DNA also gives rise to hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, director of studies, innovation and foresight at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers the criminal investigation services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in one hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensure that the person is the person they claim to be).
The identification so far concerned the issuance of identity papers: biometric elements (prints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has about all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or store.
"We collect images from surveillance cameras and compare them to pictures of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, who is responsible for commercial development for biometric identification solutions at NEC France.
Other use: take a photo of a quidam standing in line in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another", explains Cyrille Bataller, from Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the keystroke of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and retail brands: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French merchants.
Tracks to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in the cash register for thirty seconds less, it is appreciable," explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure enclosure, which blocks if we try to move it," says Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, for lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts continue to be concerned.
"The advances in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," predicted Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was given a 1,000-pound almond
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink set in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree in Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without due care and attention.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a six-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay a fee of £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners to break the London bubble
The Consolidated Revenue Fund has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in Budget 2012 recorded a 7% stamp duty on properties that cost more than £2 million and an annual fee for buyers who choose to own properties in a corporation rather than as an individual.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 million in fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "Following the increase in the stamp duty on high value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high value properties are underimposed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous area southwest of London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show a steady year-to-year growth of 5.6% but were overshadowed by a growing "domestic market", with the city's south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies have shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs move more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was happening in other species.
He added that as in humans, the right side of the brain in dogs was responsible for movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disorderly tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we have been able to trade the tail movement and present it as going more left or right."
When the animals saw a dog with no expression moving the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail that deviated mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog moving the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he didn't think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know from experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs several times and if you notice that, most of the time, the movement from their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at Bristol University's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were easier to go to a robot dog when its tail moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements from different mammals indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after Laryngitis was diagnosed with her singer.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform on Friday in the downtown The Hydro concert hall.
However, his laryngite forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the band was forced to postpone a concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys said: "Following the decision to postpone the concert at the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show at the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1st."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets not being able to perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on November 21.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.

Pope Francis to Name His First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will name new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest churchmen placed in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – it is therefore a group of 120 "cardinal voters".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops would be elevated to the dignity of Cardinal, known as the Consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal voters will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope usually named as many cardinals as needed for the number of cardinal voters to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The Consistory of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope Francis in March of this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe, and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"From now on, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "almost possible" that François would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises – so we don't know who he will name".
GM reminds some of its new pickups in the United States to repair seat back
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to solve a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a statement by the US vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, records do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) report.
The recalled models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first U.S. car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to the owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's share price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday morning in Montreal.
The drama occurred at approximately 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on there for some time.
A adjoining foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred at the time the victim had just arrived at the site in order to recover his tools.
I was driving by and I saw the wall collapsing with a big cloud of smoke," said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the construction site.
I disembarked and went to remove the big bricks that covered it.
You only saw a part of her back, it's so unhappy.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his 50s who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his grave wounds.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
Obama's Voter's Cry of Desperation
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change
He says Obama made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican party obstructionism.
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Faculty of Medicine.
I'm reading an awfully sad book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me during the morosity of the second year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's about memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical reports in the evening and went to bed, this book takes me back to the time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and newscasters took the time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was moving towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period prior to his assumption of office in 2008, he had 82% favourable views.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, it is like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of our army from Iraq, the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer explain.
I am on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the government's misdeeds.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the escape of public funding and the overexpenditure allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unsophisticated alternative that did not seem to allow for the determination of his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that had been heard for so long.
Yet, while the favourable opinion index fell below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He makes me desire the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania Primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We have to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The rider, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid emergency response, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billion MP Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The mining magnate, which challenges the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out issues of potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be eliminated.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were prepared to benefit personally from these policies.
"There will be a significant conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the Electoral Commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of reshaping the ballot box system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your contact information on a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark the ballot papers.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission had explored options for electronic voting and had recently published a joint concept paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, stated that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We are not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Mission Officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Environments (OCEAMM) returns for L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin?
It's good news, but I'm not surprised.
While in the past species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification science.
It is not impossible, moreover, that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or belonging of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
At the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged due to advances in genetics.
Similarly, two very morphologically close species were distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as the Wildlife Conservation Society has stated?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and thus its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by the researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if there is a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture in the region, we could be dealing with extinction of a species, rather than local extinction of a population of a species that is more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the potential for recovery from neighbouring stocks.
For the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has emerged, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
On the other hand, more closed ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known.
We'd rather send robots to Mars than know what lives in the Mariana pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money in the search for life on other planets than in marine research and it is high time that this change.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the record, again showing that the global regulator's investigation into suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations on the world's largest financial market, where 5.3 trillion US dollars change hands every day.
Both traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the widening of the survey that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from the regulators.
"The ongoing investigation into this matter is continuing and we are fully cooperating with the CFA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had transmitted e-mail and instant message folders, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European spot trading manager for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European cash exchange manager at Citi, was put on leave this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had brought an action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma stated that it was investigating suspicions of foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who would have agreed to manipulate rates on the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks peel instant messages and emails sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News about these surveys has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment bank trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the deal by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost."
The news arrived the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had returned a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after it caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the business was controlled," said a representative of Crédit Suisse.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford has been sloppy, says a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had got hold of a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an investigation that was "so sloppy."
Ruby said she believed in La Presse canadien that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's 35-year-old friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering parcels to Rob Ford, indicating new court documents.
Ruby described the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, claiming that Chief Bill Blair had consciously chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman, Mark Pugash, described Mr. Ruby's words as "obvious and desperate attempt" to be used by the media in a case that does not concern him.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges in decline at mid-meeting, except London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are on a downward trend on Friday at midday, with some news from disappointing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious because they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could unravel its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of inflation at 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
Wall Street's futures are predicting an opening up of U.S. stocks, after two consecutive retreats.
Renault (-4.63%) recorded the CAC 40's strongest fall, with a warning on the result of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) scored the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after having also published declining results this morning and announced the creation in-house of a bad bank with 38 billion pounds of riskiest assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to press reports that AT&T is considering a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is well underway, as demonstrated by John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and in session reached a lower of two weeks at $1.3517.
The same assumptions support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court Validates Obama's Health System Reform Law
Great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today declared that Obama's bill to reform the health system was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared it constitutional under the government's tax power.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Act by 2,700 pages and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered under the penalty of losing all federal funding for the programme, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the presidential election in the 2012 primary elections, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
At the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Wreaths were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by MP Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli occupation on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday evening, October 31, 2013, during a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, 1 November, after its fuel supplies were exhausted, the Palestinian Enclave Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another cadre of Hamas' armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a tank shell fire during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Yunes in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigade officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a Palestinian-drilled tunnel
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made a 100-metre incursion into the territory and then withdrew.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had died during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell by defending the territory during a incursion of the Zionist occupier into Khan Yunes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug into Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, stating that the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and injured 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said the spokesman for the Peter Lerner army.
In addition, Israel struck an air military base in north-western Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the satellite channel Al-Arabiya.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details of the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi capital chain stated that "the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of medical activists and sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents to Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by Henri Michaux's inks and poems, the second infused by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies by Satie.
An evening that allows to see all the prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and black ink to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, of profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a Henri Michaux ink is projected.
The body, simple trait, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole piece: a thread of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, entirely dressed in black, only the hands and face discovered, wait on either side of the playground, rush when the next screen appears, incarnate it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux takes place as a relay of solos, as a group in unison (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
One thinks of "morning gloire", where, solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, placed online at the forestage.
That's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, microphone in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotonous in the cry, and continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This energetic sound discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a strength at Chouinard - such as those hairs that grow swollen or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, has established herself, with her tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's inks, like Gestalt forms, open up a broader and giboyous imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by a strobe light and the white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches the magic.
The public liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after intermission, are richer.
The scene is partly draped with grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their awkward music, touching, gives a real fragility.
On stage, pass couples, in love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choruses, writing is less binary.
Buffoons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, with a red nose, in highly polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivals, runaways or players.
The gesture, the laughter and the little cries beautifully transpose the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the coitus bodies, the beings that melt.
But the room takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back to the scene when the audience leaves.
Here, everything becomes possible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the dancers cabotine, descend among the spectators, gloose, smoke, short-circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness sweat, and it is Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, began an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that it combed at the post auction of patents that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the US Assize Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to search terms on the Internet, indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, finally offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel patents against Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, it has violated and continues to violate the said patents," said the trial's conclusions.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater causing the explosion
The grandmother reportedly lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a leak of gas from a defective water heater, said Friday evening the Deputy Attorney of the King.
The expert sent to the scene by the prosecutor's office ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a build-up of gas.
The life-threatening prognosis of both victims is still engaged.
The grandmother was projected by the explosion and is seriously burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was by his side and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and at length conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairway that remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the neighbouring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of the CPAS.
The firemen of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police intervened.
Crisnea's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take the oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of investiture, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of investiture in the presidency, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of State of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the 18 judges in black robe of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to acclaim the new president and, standing out from the presidential fascist of Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the uncharismatic "relief wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has considerably strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech in which he tried to run as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against President Mubarak's authority.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the room decorated with woodwork where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he delivered his inaugural speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military band that played the national anthem as he stood at your attention.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
When he arrived, he was greeted by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand...", by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from where the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year left, and swore to recover the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the former ousted president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The U.S. shutdown slowed the rise in the car market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal administrations affected the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing figures published by manufacturers on Friday, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit's three major manufacturers have double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was estimated at 15.3 million by Morgan Stanley's analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight slowdown is primarily due to "the government's 'shutdown' and its impact on the consumer's feelings during the first half of the month".
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands have seen their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit, among other things, from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have sales below consensus, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share earned 1.4% at 4:35 p.m. GMT, while Ford lost 1.1%.
Renault on the Stock Exchange by Nissan's warning
Renault is on Friday the fastest fall in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it has decreased its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reorganization of its management.
Several traders reported that Renault's share was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," said a Parisian broker's trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two dead in a shooting near a neo-Nazi party building
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by shots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing a room of the late Neonazi Golden Dawn party in the western suburb of Athens, it was learned from a police source.
The police were currently unable to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards on their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist officers rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of New Iraq, where the incident took place and closed the area.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six Golden Dawn MPs, including the party leader and founder, for participating in "a criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an antifascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, captain of the Celtic Glasgow, saw his appeal dismissed and will be suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Exulsed against the Barça for having sent a blow to Neymar, the Scottish community saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a press release, his club said it was "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after noon on Friday, due to strong winds affecting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area also has its share of power outages with nearly 7,000 private power households in the city and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and hopes for record results thanks to holidaymakers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The Executive Director, Graham Turner, said Flight Centre had made 8% profits in the first half of the year and that the second half of the year had started in strength, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results throughout the year before deducting interest and taxes," he said.
This applies to Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the leisure travel sector at Flight Centre has performed well, while business customers have spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year, where seasonal demand was lower, and was expected to reap a profit for the third consecutive year as a whole.
Flight Centre's shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown people shoot at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids
Unaccompanied people opened fire this Friday at a hotel near the Cairo pyramids in Egypt without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees.
The assailants fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, General Abdel Latif.
This attack occurred while Egypt received almost no tourist since the army dismissed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and condemned in blood the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the course of English literature, students will have to study at least one Shakespeare play, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other key areas next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Examinations Regulatory Office, will unveil a reshaping of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking over the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," emphasizing that GCSEs would be "more challenging, ambitious and rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students offer approximately 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of in-depth math – as well as the greater emphasis on subjects in international rankings – will likely encourage schools to provide more teaching hours.
The programme will focus more on "real world problems", including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that State which largely undermines the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octagenary welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Minors aged 9 and 13 were door-to-door asking for candy on Halloween night.
One of the residents of the Muy neighbourhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years old, explained to the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The ex-head of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever finding his trace, was in fact buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller did not survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte in 1945", he provided daily mass circulation on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great puzzles of the Afterwar.
In the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando," according to Mr. Tuchel.
He was wearing a general's uniform.
"In the left inner pocket were his service records with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district town hall of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, expressed shock at this revelation.
May one of the most brutal Nazi sadists be buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled on," he insured himself in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller was one of the prominent personalities of the Third Reich who had never been captured.
He took part in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr Georges Bwelle provides free health care in Cameroon's villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect the "CNN Hero of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma whose sequelae he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years with his father in crowded clinics and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," Bwelle adds.
You can leave the house at 5:00 a.m., run into the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By comparison, the U.S. ratio is 1 physician per 413 population.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country's health expenditure is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgical procedures free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they choke in vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and crossing difficult terrain to reach the villages most in need of assistance.
Chance doesn't always follow them.
They had to push the vehicles many times to cross muddy rivers or tracks.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr.Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
"We get 500 people on each visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this mobile hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate – a document necessary to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical acts under local anaesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the procedure, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a gruelling rhythm, but the musicians in the villages usually help the team stay motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sundays, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge over the last year, and it knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free surgery he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," the man said.
In addition to living this mobile hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr.Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of its association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student from Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteered with Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's still in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help with the blood or to pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
It's not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you're a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their boarding, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not close to extinction.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons that make me do that.

The two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Undoubtedly, but stressing its weakness for the cross-roads, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Études.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heir of the armchair held by Fontenelle at the Académie française?
Of course again, but knowing that such a sacre cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis, which happened.
They readily recognized him as a great awakener, animator and federator of their work, but pointed out that he was reluctant to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Memory places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The wicked tongues could see there a huge flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, endowed with a sharp glance and erudition lest, but incurably dilettante.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who did not write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet, once again, we find the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagrancy, jubilation set to jump as if at feet joined from one subject to another.
But we quickly understand that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the brocantor back to one and the same passion: to discover the constitutive node of French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it is a concern of the time.
Not long ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition of it.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was necessary only to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora hunts is quite different.
He does not arise as an heir of eternal frankness, he refuses to define himself.
An analyst worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped every step by an object in the form of a rebus, tormented by irritating questions.
Of which this one, which is born of the enterprise itself: why, in a country so long-termly settled within its borders, so oldly carpented and solidly masonized, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are so pressing, Pierre Nora suggests, only to conjure up the disorder born from the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the divisional forces here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that splits national history.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not manage to deny it; on the contrary, anxious to regain its sacrality and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility, since it had cut its head off from the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invinciblely binary nation, shared between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity feel, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora's American getaway might well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, intended to found a new society.
But American cousinship only better emphasizes what we own.
There, men who had left their former regime in England and had no more to worry about.
Here, men congested with an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here it sow the drama and confides it.
There are still honored founding fathers, and here there are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who have killed each other.
Here an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, as many mistakes to catch up with and attempts to resume.
France is leaving, France is coming
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could put on the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this third republic, a central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a great deal of interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who then tried to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in the old France obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity only had a time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France that is leaving and the circumspect sketch of France that is coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
We find out that the chemineau was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities turned, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker was located in the centre of the centre.
And the one who had deposited, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had escaped the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually have done it.
Certainly in a form less stiff, more broken and more subtle.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Removed in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team of "Antenne 2" who came to film a demonstration of Hezbollah, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the association "Otages du monde", which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective: to obtain the possibility for hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage takers to the International Criminal Court.
In detention for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to return to their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" questioned 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the night of your release, you were on the stage of the 20h of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your liberation today?
In Beirut, in particular.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says, "We're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but we're very tense, too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're taking us to the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible hustle and bust.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three television channels.
I'll be right back and there's plenty.
The descent from the stairs of the plane, the reunion with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers are pulling themselves to make pictures and following me to my home where I have to do a little police to prevent some from going up.
Media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and suddenly we're in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to deal with.
But we did the hardest thing.
That night, I'm at 8:00, and the next day, I'm on TV.
Then begins a kind of rehabilitation to life, very slowly, for a month or two that are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I had been given a first medical examination in Corsica.
The rest was done at Val-de-Grâce the following days I returned: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
That made sense.
I didn't mind.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what you're saying.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things make me angry, others less.
I try to do the part between the questions about my past as a hostage and my cap as president of the association "Otages du monde" which allows me to distance myself, and seems much more interesting to me to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight with others for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
The hostage-taking of hostages must be described as "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow hostages to have access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostage-takers to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might also have access to justice?
That's what a court in The Hague is for.
Why don't we tell the hostage takers "you've flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me to be well-founded, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and it shockes me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger roars in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the fallen President Mohamed Morsi began, they went down the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial highlights this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet with him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a joke.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial, a pro-Morsi, is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres in Rabaa, the massacres in Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Confrontations broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, and 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 American states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses are entitled to an identity card from the Department of Defense and to the benefits that come with it," recalled the minister in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League against Anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard", he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their shops.
The Secretary of Defence said that he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that the federal law was implemented.
The nine-state sling began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the premises of the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between the Texas Law and the Federal Law on Homosexual Marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to be around 5,600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2nd at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registrations are taken on-site on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and qualification phases will begin at 10 a.m. before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young hyerois prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year and he doesn't like anything but to show up to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Mayor of Toronto hunts journalists to interrogate him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugs, according to several media reports.
A video handed to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he chased from his property several journalists who had come to interrogate him.
We also believe that sometimes images do not need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on 25 October in Argenteuil and died on 28 October.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Institut Pasteur.
"An epidemiological investigation was initiated to identify and care for those who might have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October included," says the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, given after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," said the press release.
The ministries now call people who have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or on skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal was in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been rabies free since 2001, this kitten or the mother has been imported from another country, not unscathed", according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "indigenous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
One case of rabies on a bitch illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a life-threatening disease if not treated in time", recalls the ministries and is transmitted for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama reverses his health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama yesterday came back to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health care system, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people have received notices of termination from their claimants, the Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days by accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with appropriate health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an effervescence in the news" about terminations, President Obama has urged Americans who receive these notices to seek new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-suited health plans for the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll be a winner," he said.
The Authority announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who contract their own insurance were forced to change their plan because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me speak directly to these Americans: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony before the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, indicated that the launch of the online market in October had failed "unfortunately."
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone," she added.
I can't wait to regain your confidence.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who spoke this sentence, while she believed her microphone cut, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly meeting following an exchange of contentious points of view with Billy Long, the Republican representative of Missouri, to see if she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long continued to ask Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts of millions of Americans.
Vettel holds a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky elected, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colours of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the level of the track.
The German Sebastian Vettel, quadruple Formula 1 World Champion, strenghtened for free practice at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, from his stable.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see closely the German champion, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, on the test.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
Inhabitant of Aubervilliers launches his Suburb Party
Let us not be deceived.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the Suburb" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his native commune of Aubervilliers, was born out of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great melting pot cultural that characterizes above all neighborhoods.
My proposal number one is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, claims today as "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
It's only to extremist parties that I don't talk.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme -consultable on the Internet - based on many themes supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, this may be fair," he admits.
It's a matter of time and money.
The Suburb Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune assures that he already has seven heads of list in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support e-mails I've been receiving since yesterday don't all come from the suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedented fact, that American espionage "had gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programs by admitting, made unprecedented, that on several occasions, espionage "had gone too far inappropriately."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on "autopilot" when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA's spying activities came into being.
The leaks put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have learned some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first senior member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had gone beyond limits, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry stressed, however, that the NSA was an active force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US spying affair and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, said Thursday the Chair of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken to the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had made regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration of the National Security Agency's oversight.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay with us in the mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chair of the US Senate's European Affairs Sub-Committee, in an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to combat terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has undermined relations with some US allies, but the director of the agency said this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Other revelations referred to documents disclosed by Snowden according to which the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the allied espionage by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this atmosphere of tumult, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a congressional trip, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of the other participating legislators should be revealed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show "loving firmness."
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the kind of spying programmes they have been implementing for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by US strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by US surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, pinned by Shell's poor performance and the day after the Fed announced that it would continue to support the economy, as planned.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgement and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had attacked her early on Sunday, 10 June.
However, video surveillance recordings later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the whole story.
She was detained in a cell in the local police station before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days' imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Rugby League Australian player Peter Tunks, who called on Canberra's Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"Of course we've had a moment of anxiety, but we hope to get her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgement and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that, in the meantime, it was on holiday in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of an Australian travel agent, Michelle Smith, in Phuket, Thailand could also seek to re-enact her deteriorating image among tourists, which could lead to an acquittal.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters who came in other than with the RSCA buses.
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed Tuesday, said Marie Verbeke, the spokesperson of the Brussels-Midi police zone, Friday.
Belgian supporters of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will have to use the displacement system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokesman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"While other supporters had an intention of travelling to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even police custody," said Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
A year ago, this prompted a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to consider ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just revealed its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision Diversity has been walking around schools for the past year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are native or come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"Thus, projects are created so that they identify with all this," says Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, of the Institut du Nouveau Monde, has identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support of staff in the transformations we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he lists.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the Université de Montréal will be its Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different pedagogical strategies are the real need," she says.
The research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
