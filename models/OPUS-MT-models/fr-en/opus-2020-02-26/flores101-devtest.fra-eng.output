This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as color and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but show other characteristics specific to feathers – beards and beards – researchers have concluded that rachis is probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they are not used in flight but rather for regulating or displaying temperature. The researchers suggested that, even if the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists say it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not a young one.

The effect the team was seeking would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's black matter and the Milky Way's black matter.
Just as the moon exerts traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other black matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting is traditionally an experiment of low technicality: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the agents have checked his identity, the elector throws the envelope in the ballot box and signs his voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except for those of the electors duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, according to specific procedures.

She first took part in the slalom, where she got a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of 116 competitors got the same result in this race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in tenth place in the women's group sitting with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, finish first, and 1:09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, finish ninth.
In the women's ski-sitting category, four skiers were unable to complete their course; in the giant slalom category, 45 skiers out of a total of 117 in this race failed to rank.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for violating the Swiss national, and we recovered her phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutana Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, police commissioner, said that the accused persons had their faces hidden when they appeared in court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit him, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow the rescue services to extract the driver from the Red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of her son by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody pending trial and trial, but eyewitnesses could be compromised as her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has told journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the flight, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics included the future state of Jerusalem, which was sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority consents only for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Manager of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly inducted yesterday a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to engage the country in new elections.
This commission was the response of Martelly to the vast protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of defective iPods overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious".
The department responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Mariana at 7.19 a.m. local time (21.19 a.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Alert Centre stated that there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by diverting their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the death of at least six of them has been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Philippine photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins worked in the hospital, he began investigating premature deliveries during his spare time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone is administered, it will accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and I'm going to miss her... I hope she's resting in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8% since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of respondents share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule over Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, as they were prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number known to date.
Several people checked the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described rumours as "talking and political nonsense."
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technologies, not on ground radar systems used previously, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transportation has created the possibility that the game can be played behind closed doors, without the team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pine tree, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-billed immigrant pine tree, Geospiza conirostris.
One can shape gold in many ways. It can be rolled into tiny pieces
It can be drawn in fine thread, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled in sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The cabbage juice changes colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into one ball with the hands clean and moist.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with a flush in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and sends it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 meters high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The greatest advantage it has brought is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
This has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized felines that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelope and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including wild pet cats) that eat much more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and lions.
Women are usually very close to each other, with a large number of sisters and girls in their families.
Lion troops act as packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big felines) in their behaviour, and also very deadly to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and tow five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genre Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones able to roar.
The roaring of the tiger does not resemble the wide roaring of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be shouting and rumbling.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
According to the scientists, the ocelots hunt and find the animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their way on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and they also travel very furtively. Ocelots hunt their prey by basing themselves in their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it used to be.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a powerful competitor to what it used to need.
The population of origin has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered as belonging to the same species.
We call this process "speciation", which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses and our plant-based clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without the plants, the animals would not survive.
The mosaur was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing, except the other mosaur.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional series of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We are not sure, but he may have had the forked tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaurs, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no size against him.
Although the Romans consumed food we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the loir, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they were eating.
The Roman meals of ancient times could not include those foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no former Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramid towers, the ziggourats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was in the open air.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
Since there were no large forests in Canaan's land, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland — and named it so — traveling further west.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian", there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Treasure of the Templars, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776" could be read. The text is at the bottom of the document, backwards.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (which measures about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of facing it.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in the south of France, an invasion called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and headed for Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis", which means civil and which is related to the Latin words "civis", which means citizen, and "civitas", which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-States are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a sustainable cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government — Congress being its only component — under the articles of Confederation.
Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the State authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its group of islands, Japan is often referred to from a geographical point of view as an archipelago.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through it mentioned it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of native grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–95), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it surrendered Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the room of the three windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better overview of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analog film age.
It's still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera photographic sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually, and it's pretty confusing, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
It is therefore said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integer numbers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, heavily abused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that stimulates dynamism while offering protection to the image.
It indicates that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was called into question.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has linked European states to each other despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than 1000 years and this concentration of power and money led many people to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved to be effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters in order to prevent ships from ventureping into entire maritime areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic generated only a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction to its boundless underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a penchant for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of the war during the First World War, the nations wished to prevent such a situation from reoccurring in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a poetry book and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; every stage of China or every family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the time of the Three Kingdoms which took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest times in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the grand palace of XI'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution has also inspired many other repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond the framework of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous under the name "Hira" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists.
Above it is possible to contemplate nothing other than the bright and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave you can only see or hear very few things from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many giant structures erected in honour of the deceased Pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, or "Giza necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, consists of several pyramids (the great pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol resembles a V and the "pull" symbol resembles a staple or square whose lower side is missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow to the top usually produces a softer sound, while a bow down is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to put your own marks in pencil, but remember that the printed bow marks are for a musical reason, and that it is therefore generally necessary to respect them.
On 6 Oct. 1789 King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4,) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who scream and shout threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the super-profits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages – period of history in Europe during the 11th to 13th centuries (1000-1300).
The Middle Central Ages was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from technological push or imperative to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on societies conditioned inherently rather than socially.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also leads to a greater impact of road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care technologies to treat bodily injuries.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered to be that of feudal Europe.
His reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders took care of gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western modes could be between 25 and 30 years behind schedule.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons for the closure of clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture that produces enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system, using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnic origin, class, location and/or sex of the limbs.
Criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often report their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "violent" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully raised by non-human species, wild children display behaviour (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that reared them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
Supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the small man trombone of Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to interview, guide and explain procedures that could have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to extortion to abuse.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to usages and gratuities.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered to be major factors in the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, i.e. facial expressions for a few milliseconds.
One claim is that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The Speaker's Speech, described how people who cannot understand the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
It even suggests that such ability to interpret human behaviour can be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research of the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins at each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (formis, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" a little in the same way as the chimpanzees of savannah do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and sleep soon after (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The weaker the tension, the more positive the present vital force is. Each person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (light energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is thanks to the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the activated chakras, and the awakening consciousness created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, the deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, be they bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most effective way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-Boots, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagro Mountains of Iran.
The ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that wandered on the hills or other pasture areas, often treated by chevriers who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more known term shepherds. These pastoral methods always take place today.
The "carways" were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although car tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses who pulled them to achieve higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The cruises were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it was gradually realized that the runways would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first way of locomotion was walking: humans started walking up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopitheques, did not walk as usual.
Biped specializations are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become more important because of the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten project signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to a few streets from there, to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on 8 July.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, which had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs being given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and with claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic drugs or domestic chemicals.
Consult the label for the specific first aid instructions for this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects very suitable for parasitizing humans.
The reduvs, as well as the bed bugs, are nested, that is, adapted to live in the nest or the habitat of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, composed of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may very well feel that it is not in their or the child's interest to care for the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
As part of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method guides most scientific research.
It is not, however, the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but which also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline in knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not merely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA in a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can result in cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
One can for example go to see, photograph and discover the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural towns by car to get to their workplace and meet other people who will work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on passenger cars.
Science now shows that this massively carbon-based economy has dislodged the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they break down on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be mathematically approximated.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragon flies and ephemerals.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water from the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, peoples have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, for they are found in nature in raw form and are quite simple to mine using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also issued the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
Alloys are also found that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new forms of writing has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to more rare uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil waistband.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty arrives.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
A bit like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, and then releasing a little of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon consists of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust thickness is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what makes people feel good or attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates some people to want the things they do and what in their environment motivates them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factors theory.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the head of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being to try to stay "the right boyfriend" (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one turns into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she has to change everything that the group has created until then and do things his/her way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behaviour often leads to dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to impose on itself the tedious process of creating a learning structure? One of the objectives of implementing organizational concepts of learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the client's need.
Before an organization is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own learning culture.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition study, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, injury, tumours and brain trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often highly connoted as science fiction, it represents a very important part of the computer sciences that study the behaviour, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is automation by task machines requiring an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focusing on the contribution of solutions to the problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been planted in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can look at the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Virtually participating in an excursion is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is beginning to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "makes students better aware of the world around them." The need for public interest encourages students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When we make good use of it, blogs "can enable students to strengthen their analytical skills and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their views with that of others and present their own views on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings that have a virgin natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider to be Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent of its own, in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs have also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion has spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Town road linking Europe with India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
To women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a wedding ring (which should not seem too valuable.
Women must realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men's advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the tenth century B.C.E., and was used by Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after destroying it had rebuilt it and named Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajins, pottery, leather goods, nargile and tumblers of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the extreme east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably sure, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo Volcano as well as for treks tracking mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (moto taxi) to move around Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites at risk due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World" on the PBS.
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, divided into 14 ecozones, each containing a specific wildlife.
It is one of the most well-known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entry and conservation fees for the park.
It may be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card that provides access to some parks in South Africa, as well as to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main focus of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings that draw the Hong Kong horizon was compared to a glittering bar graph, which reveals itself by reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful panoramas of Hong Kong, leave the island and reach the Kowloon seafront opposite.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is concentrated on the north shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarban National Park.
The forests, however, do not consist solely of mangrove marshes: they also contain some of the last remains of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered with water/trapping areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 tigers from the Royal Bengal and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coasters, which are comfortable and robust.
Collective taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a hauban bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock in Guyana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters; it is 378 meters long and has two tracks of 3.50 m wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence farming.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly by fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of India", was born from the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a commonly accepted currency throughout the islands, while in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if the UK and US currencies may be accepted. Talk in advance with the owners to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Falklands outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo being located in the south of Ecuador, the winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical area and summer temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than the thermometer says.
There are no really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is approximately constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are nevertheless wildlife; please do not feed them or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, it is necessary to be at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, bison, elk, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year dozens of visitors are injured because they have not kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, know that odours attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking smelly foods and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful gathering held in the city during the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, because Auckland is riding on two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay north to Devonport south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow for safe bathing, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburbs of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
These beaches, sometimes very frequented by families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One", a fairly ordinary beer, but tasty and refreshing. There is also another local beer, the "Manta".
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink water from the local tap safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "creme coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso", cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the canister jellyfish arrive near the beaches and river estuaries. They can also be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would depart from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking gives the traveller peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book through travel agencies other types of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast, transportation from/to the airport or even packages combining flight and accommodation.
They can also retain the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or to obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed campground.
Don't forget that even if the musical shows are finished on the main stages, other musical shows can continue until late in the night on other festival sites.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the north of the Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed cabins.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make many efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. There are rarely windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment in order to maintain the good mood of the guests and keep them there.
On some sites, it is the locals that offer free alcoholic drinks. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone travelling by car at high latitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
On ice and snowy roads, the friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on the bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in very short time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powdering or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, the presence of ice and snow is normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari are perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and the most significant moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, especially in the savannah, with the aim of attending the striking spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you will see them better with binoculars.
A safari on foot (also called "walking in the bush", "walking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing approximately 7,000 yen.
By ironing wet clothes, they can be dried more easily. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be lent, even if there are none in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you find one.
Avoid not letting the tissue overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, boil water for one minute; in others, boil water for several minutes.
The efficiency of the filters varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter harmful animals they do not know in their region of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some communities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limits displayed are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and cooked in pastry all year round, while cherries and plums point at the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often marry especially well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish made of herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid" depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands and Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without any other qualifier, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of dishes simply seasoned, the predominant flavours that Javanese prefer are peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The calipers are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a security problem: in fact, the user's feet can remain stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot in the caliper, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and narrow sole.
Then, some saddles, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a stretcher to fall from the saddle if it is pulled backwards by a falling rider.
Valley of Cochamó – The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the mountain peaks, the panoramas on the mountains are stunning. Mountain climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are unlimited.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down a snow-covered track with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums", which organize their entire holidays according to the ski in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 years BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the seventeenth century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Ski trekking: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine-style skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which take place on rugged terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than on foot – but you will rarely reach cross-country skiing speeds without a heavy backpack on groomed slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. In classical circumstances, travelling across several countries therefore involves having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross the borders without crossing through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the member countries of the space, saving time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition to determine whether a manufactured object is an antique. Some tax agencies define goods over 100 years of age as antiques.
The criteria vary depending on where one is located; in some parts of the world, as in North America, the age limit may be lower than that in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be considered antiques, even if they are less old than similar industrial products.
Reindeer rearing is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding, they were engaged in fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as trait animals.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roms, the term "Gitan" is often considered pejorative because of its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country in which you visit is the subject of a warning to travellers issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also use the advice of other governments than yours, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
As an example, American citizens in the Middle East could face situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that could cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of many kinds, depending on geographical, topographic and atmospheric characteristics.
Violent winds, hail, excessive precipitation and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, marine trombs and cyclones.
Extreme, regional and seasonal weather events include cold storms, snow storms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their region of destination, knowing that this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone considering visiting a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search of "Courses in the Hostile Environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents in their possession for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports whose sex is not indicated (X) or documents updated to match the name and gender desired varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not expect to pass scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The pull-out currents are the currents that come back from the waves that break on the beach, often on a pitfall or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid current to deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion resulting from an attempt to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, the return to swimming is no more difficult than usual.
Try to aim for a place where you will not be caught again. It is also possible, whether depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
The reintegration shock occurs earlier than the cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travellers who have struggled to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you go home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country had to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also necessary for travellers returning home.
One of the region's most interesting attractions for children is the light and sound show at the pyramid.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, were claimed by several nations and had the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples are Livingston Island and Deception, where the caldeira flooded with an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbour.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains melted into the plateau and then reappeared to form the 360-km-long mountain range of Ellsworth, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote locations, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have an unobstructed view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions with remote data and telephone needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those planning a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn while traveling, and more and more of them choose this possibility.
This approach is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school, as it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
Often, having taken sabbatical courses abroad can actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a general rule, registration fees must be paid to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a destination of choice for pleasure boating. The "Country of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, this is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go to shore with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, in Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
We must not be ashamed of it: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people feel about other things.
For some, understanding something about how the aircraft works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Transport companies are well remunerated for quick deliveries. Often, in the context of urgent repairs, the issue of deadlines is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own planes, but on other roads and for small businesses, there was a problem.
Had they sent goods by air freight, on certain routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to get it more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send luggage without a passenger, and that's where you intervene.
The most obvious way to travel first class or business class is to pay a large sum of money for this privilege (or, better still, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek reductions for business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of passengers who are willing to pay very much for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares with knowledge of the matter.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no member country of the United Nations.
The economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent connecting platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, developed and lively shopping centre, set around an immense bay surrounded by mountains.
Large boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red roofs, the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

On your way to the north, do not miss visiting the superb shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (temple), a place known worldwide for Mary's apparitions.
Remember that you visit essentially a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, Jews or non-Jewish alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan only, as the law establishes that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are only made in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have the reputation of being self-centered, rude and arrogant.

When visiting a monastery, women must wear skirts covering their knees and have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide stoles to women who arrive without anything, but if you bring yours, and besides it has bright colors, you will have a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
Just as men must wear trousers covering their knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the stock at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts. A unique size for men!
Majorquin cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.

Premodern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plumflowers were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first feasts of flowering cherry trees were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one".
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, the collection of "species" will also cause you to evict without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to move, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive on site.

All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming or floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance between them and the mainland, mammals were unable to reach the end of the voyage, making the giant turtle the main pasture animal of the Galapagos.
