Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers the latter to be a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments enacted new laws from 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon became more widespread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the addition of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require electors to present a photo ID and proof of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day and remove the right to vote from citizens with legal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID card.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they had sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID card.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than a hundred dollars to obtain the required ID card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, who are considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID card issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use the cards issued by these clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no State required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to make such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored laws in 2011 abolishing voter registration on polling day in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of Hispanics.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In return, the whites who made up 76% of the voters represented only 46% of the electors voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID card.
Nevertheless, the new rules introduced will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed and see it as a clear objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to state with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively influence the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the ABS test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which result in unnecessary medical interventions.
This makes men who are already reluctant to take screening tests even more hesitant.
Do you want to take the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also demonstrated, with follow-up after 12 years, that between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if not detected.
So I recommend the test from age 50, or from age 40 if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
We really need to make the patient understand the degree of risk of cancer, by offering them the options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and instead by opting, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest they do active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
Increasingly, criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated are being determined with precision.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether we should do it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the ABS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of harm.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one else smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Many also remain totally unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is related to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is a major damage to people's health.
"Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," laments spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that the regular practice of physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it says.
Food
The body also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too many cases, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
Charcuteries too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can result in the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," one explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
Their research, however, is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"To take a screening test doesn't give cancer."
Higgs' boson shelled
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole stir last summer, and for cause.
We believe that this boson is involved in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely sure.
Let us assume, however, that it is the Higgs, since the chances of being wrong seem slim, and let us see what this is about.
There is, in this world, a inevitably inevitable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break this rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even if the physics of particles is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly of some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In a corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other one the bosons, a dirty gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons are then divided into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not approach here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosoms, it must be pointed out here, are not all as exotic as one might think.
In fact, if you can read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light" which is the "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disturbs" the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a bit like a rock thrown into a pond.
From this "derangement" arises an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "carriers of force".
More stable field
It is the same with the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond whose only very large rock could ride the surface.
This is why it takes a huge particle accelerator like that of CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
It is not all particles, nor all materials, that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, it is not all particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while others (like the photon, here) do not.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, this is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any discrepancies between MS observations and predictions.
In fact, there are a number of people who are eager to find them, because the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and close some of the holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, offering no explanation for gravity (ops!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-ops!).
But we haven't found any such deviations at CERN so far.
Impacts
The impact of this research on the daily lives of Mr. and Mrs. All-the-World is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
At the very beginning of the 1960s, laser pioneers in the Bell Laboratories had no suspicion of the revolution that their work was about to start.
They could see scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we have already told us the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed), in 1962 - the laser was initially seen as a "lab gadget".
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as an "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and has earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC activities will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, you never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...
With its Commission dying in dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to resume shortly as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The Devoir tried to take a closer look at it.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that gnawed him had left him with a two-year respite.
"They had given me five years to live, I had seven years," he said, half-raisin fig, lying in his bed at Victor Gadbois Palliative Care House in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease is doing its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even from eating alone.
Attacked in front of an appetizing lunch, he agreed to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even manages to smile, speaks to strangers who work around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is pissing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing to the child's stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to accept regression," he says.
For, in the opinion of many people working in palliative care, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life prognosis of three months.
At this point, the "team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provide so - called "curative care. "
For 89-year-old Mrs. A., the worst fear is to die "conscious and suffocated".
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she said, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting, in the next few days, for a last visit by her son from Italy.
With a group of volunteers, Victor Gadbois provides body care and food aid.
It's palliative care, which you give when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know that you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions," explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether in physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
If you die, you will be willing to give mouth care to the brandy or Pepsi, as required.
Diabetes patients will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the feet of the deceased.
" We help loved ones as much as patients, " says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
At Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow but don't look alike.
Along with an old 93 - year - old man who savors his last family meeting in the courtyard, well settled in his pillows while he is being trined in his honour, a 36 - year - old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, after trying everything to survive.
" For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45, " says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois home arrive from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Problems of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e., care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal phase of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And many organizations, such as the Victor Gadbois House and the Society for Palliative Home Care in Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec health care that makes several palliative care physicians fear the adoption of legislation to regulate euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, of the leaders of palliative care, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not effective enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to quality palliative care before they agree to euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spend 14 days in the emergency, in great pain, without doing anything to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only ask to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, several oncologists hound on their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she gave up trying chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she said.
But she told me I was done!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not accepting their request after they have been relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Society of Palliative Home Care in Greater Montreal, patients would be resistant to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to sleeping the patient until his death, either sporadically or permanently.
You can't pretend you don't hear that part of the suffering anymore.
More and more, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die. "
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a Journalism Award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate Scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell daily what they know of a formidable "system", mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has collapsed since we took the big steps," said Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former chief of police in Montreal.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a fundamental investigation into the misappropriation of road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, the hidden financing of parties and the corruption of civil servants.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he points out, the only ministry of transport would have saved a billion dollars on contracts," some re-engaging their instincts to get a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will manage to "demonstrate the ploys behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the police officers of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led the Montreal "sewer cartel" to put the pedal soft on the swellings of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and laid charges of fraud and corruption against municipal elected officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third city.
He is suspected of repeated bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Also formally accused are engineers at the Montreal road and Italian entrepreneurs, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambiato.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
For years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a Mafia-related intermediary who gave the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr.Zambito sowed at all winds in the 2000s, giving more than C$88,000 (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals then in power.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraiser for the former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts, which he inflated the costs of
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working smoothly.
Gilles Surprising, a former public works engineer, gave him a detailed presentation to the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewer contracts, the costs of which he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to having their feet greased by inflating from 30% to 40% bills, by fake extras.
Then, an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his caisses with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, to the east of the island, it insurges in 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to developers, in the middle of a real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will eventually be put in place, she says that she "shoots on a wire to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the culprits".
The process, she says, is "doulorous but positive".
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montreal-specific investigation unit and a watch, not to see suspicious practices come back.
Just like we're cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars", but is especially concerned about the role of "elected in the knowledge of the ploy", when they did not drows into the ploy!
Estimating 70% of the amount of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to $100, but that will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as election expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "We cannot go further; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a more solid basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look in their own courtyard...
"The PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
It can be explained by an individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GMP.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I progress next to them.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not inflaming myself.
From my debut at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced in steps.
You are therefore taking advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
Moreover, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He was supported by assistants such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man in the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he is not equal in Ligue 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with puppy clubs.
He's been with great players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting discussion with him.
Then I came out of a series of wounds.
The trust he gives me also explains my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the season of the PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as leader.
But we're still ambushing.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th final with the way.
What is the club's objective in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, so we can receive in the 8th final return.
Can the PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and register for the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the MTP is empowering itself to implement this project.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to put on this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be a champion...
But another team, Montpellier, achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think she's the one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from the PSG?
It's normal that we expect a lot of us in the light of what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's certainly a little frustrating.
We wonder what more people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We've proven in the Champions League that we can answer present.
Watch Manchester City, which hasn't been able to qualify for the 8th final for two seasons, they've also made huge spending!
In view of the sums invested, you were imagined 15 points ahead of the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's good to say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and puts a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves he's the star of League One.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did was really exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to make progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I was very interested in participating in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with playing time.
I saw things over there and I got out reinforced.
Today, I manage to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since I was baptized with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine and today we must have exemplary behaviour.
How do you look at Didier Deschamps' first months at the head of the Blues?
He's got the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualifying group for the World.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the winner.
Like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) ripped off in Spain on October 16 a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of peer-to-peer files.
Some 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The price of the bitcoin, after reaching a high of 30 dollars (23 euros) in June 2011, dropped to 2 dollars, five months later, before returning today around 10 dollars (the prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currency such as "credits", used to advance in a video game that you win while playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But each time, a central authority controls and deals with trade.
With Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are both custodians of the books of accounts, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses as an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronically signed by a dual-key encryption system.
The network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public account book, distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers, and whose winner, kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege of adding this extra line.
This is a file hash phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacher" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, to fraud, one user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, leaving some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also addressed with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," said Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this defect.
Actors of weight like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of the bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
They just need to communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who ensures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicted.
The ECB's report also envisages re-evaluation of the various risks, which are now considered high, in the event of the currency's success.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without waiting for anything from us.
It is above all the Afghan peasants that we have punished as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign army presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be so when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was done in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured personnel reached Kabul without being attacked, overflew by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban raid on Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country with fire and blood as a result of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants who had been overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahidin, Afghan government and current Taliban join in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, seizing government land to sell it in building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They have lost sight of themselves, and most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of the American widths: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They came to the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, and they appreciated the benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
Work will have to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
Former anti-Soviet commanders are already concerned about rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, like the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, in particular during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
No industry has been restarted, no dams are in condition, no major irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There has been widespread noise that Afghanistan has vast mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to take it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the vast Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, which depend heavily on imports and exports, will also have to re-establish normal relations.
The departure of French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: high school for girls, boys, French department at the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of bringing together aid and offensive actions, a service of "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, carried out, and carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, greedy with local labour, was able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase the area of cultivation.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at an altitude of more than 2,000 metres.
The Embassy received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural projects from local communities in Kapisa province.
In order for them to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers have said I wish, a small, well-controlled and directly affected civil aid should be maintained for them.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a new poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its all-out.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House an additional two months to finish its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the President perseveres in his "autocratic delirium", continuing to "trap his word" and "push the law".
On the part of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy while the challenge is raging throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Especially since this resort to a hasty vote is based on the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Or you vote for my text, either I keep the full powers", those supposedly to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large Islamist majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had slammed the door, considering that they could not make their views known.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, alternate members, were added hastily yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators also had fun because one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum of the Constituent was not well settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
The object of all attention, article 2 remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a major demand, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," the liberals replied, who saw it as a mere communication.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the first fruits of a theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals are also stirred up by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the moment, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the Civil Status.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" Tempère Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that "there may be an ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used use religious vocabulary.
It refers to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, edlr].
And the question may arise in the future to what extent civilian judges are competent to rule on it."
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced in comparison to what they were under the former regime.
Another contentious point is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, consideration of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as requested by human rights associations.
The latter also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, there are no more articles echoing the protection of women, says Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was supposed to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The head of state's supporters will march on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the grandeur of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argumenty i Fakty has chosen five main reasons to visit Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
Make yourself inevitable: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone entering these "baptismal lands" will be touched by divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of Jesus' miracles: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It was in this precise place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The believers travel through the Rue de la Sufferance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the pretoire), where the trial was held, then led by the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, then to that of the Stone of the Anointing and the burial.
Here lies the Christian center of the world, symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to Christian legend, the monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 B.C.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave small words with prayers, which are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineering enthusiasts can get there by their own means.
For others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m above sea level, there is the Mont Hermont ski resort, which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are 45 km long in total.
Old beliefs want pagan gods to have once lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country is home to nearly 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth the detour.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It houses the ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Judea Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to be seen: the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are exhibited.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of casts of visitors and overseers of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin's sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars are sparkling.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and welfare
Israel's three major seaside resorts are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and you can bathe there all year round.
By the way, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Azur-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains bathers, even those who can't swim.
The landscapes surrounding it are surreal beauty.
We come here to perform a treatment based on salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the secrets of antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris which connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists especially like to walk in narrow alleys that bear the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you will be able to meet newlyweds who come to take photos of all Israel and even other countries.
At Caesarea, King Herod's city, you can walk around the Roman theatre, "capture " the Crusader's Fortress.
During the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you're going to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
In terms of urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition is to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturdays.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturdays, markets, shops and public transport cease their activity.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes consisting of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts based on coconut milk, but also hummus, traditional Jewish paste, different sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafels, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are many well-nourished cats that walk the haughty air.
We can see them sleeping at night on the roofs of parked cars.
These felines love places passing by and don't refuse to enjoy them.
The rental of a car varies according to the brand from $37 for 24 hours (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of the numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists travelled to the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
As MPs and human rights activists argue about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "false" certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families stay at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force and stipulated that every migrant worker would have to pass a Russian examination.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, over time, the Federal Migration Service promises, testing will become mandatory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also that of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
You will need to validate your language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian has official language status are exempt.
Persons who obtained education certificates or diplomas prior to the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law comes into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly asked the question in the press: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service reply, this will help to reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work".
Many speak of defending the rights of migrant workers, explains Victor Sebelev, director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
Protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, on the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "travel" in an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellows will be tormented for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"In them, one thing is promised, and when they arrive, they are deceived, their passports are taken, and they do not receive the expected salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for Work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don't argue with me, policeman!
However, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to come and earn money in Russia entrust that they do not only know the language of the country they wish to visit, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to attend even a fair primary education.
Indeed, their families do not even have enough to feed their children, not to mention to dress them properly and equip them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's difficult when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and diminished."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants who have legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal examination or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defend from entering"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain an official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and still these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then, you can get a fake record quickly for only 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
"They ask us 100, 200 rubles, enough to buy cigarettes, tea," said journalists Oumed Khushkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.
"Make it quick, don't squeak and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art"
From the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that migrants' registration papers were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
Falsified papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners did not have them for nothing: every migrant who hoped thus to facilitate the task of the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of power and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "paper bits".
The authorities can give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination at first time the time to take language courses.
Moreover, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian arms carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it was the shooting at the weddings or the killing organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to prohibit the wearing of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a licence to carry a weapon from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced in the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "squeezing the screw".
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centres, demanded to abandon "this senseless hardening".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, told the Russian service Vasily Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from purchasing from the black market.
According to them, today we can find in Moscow any weapon for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior claims that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is supplied via several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served 10 years at the Ministry of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot taken from a site taking command of weapons
The first is "the military trace", i.e. the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," says Baranets.
The second type of black market weapons are those stolen from law enforcement by criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and weapons stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal pistols go for sale from the military warehouses.
Many of these have often experienced explosions.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires have been deliberately triggered to cover up the deficit," explains the former member.
For Baranets, the gun manufacturers are doing something about it.
"There are private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says one expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has formed and organizes the supply," the former soldier adds.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was established in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analysed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, the criminal files and the public data of the arms portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "by fault of the employees whose work is related to weapons", the report explains.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "smuggling".
A seller and consultant of an armory who asked to remain anonymous ensures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these underground search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will pick up new goods in military warehouses.
The person buys a unit through a sign, e.g. a TT gun.
We deliver it to him by means of a grill.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for 900 € by the unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be solved, they make a check purchase from the illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
" As in a Luxury Shop "
The seller and the buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to the Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "coin" to bargain.
The price of the gun, they gave it to me on the spot
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has contact, says the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are salespeople in the markets, but there you have to come too by saying, for example, "On the part of such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth".
Now I even buy a pair of American fists using a person I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give it.
The little new ones are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The diagrams, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a luxury store," the soldier remembers.
There is no secret for the buyer, says Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we go with the seller in the forest and set up a target.
"They let me shoot and when I'm convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating," says the expert.
A shop from his couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
To do so, no documents and no one to meet.
"All you have to do is have a precise amount of money," is the advertisement on the website "Buying a gun or a combat machine gun".
Users leave their request and ask questions.
And we sell to miners?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Ivan" (spelling retained).
"Achète TT. Moscow", writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcasted a huge network of fake sites and shovels people who want to buy combat weapons.
People run on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia

I have heard about this type of schematic: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take over.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the association "Right to a weapon", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by applying on the site, you can find yourself without a weapon and behind bars.

A Makarov for 100 dollars
The purchase of an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the association "Right to a weapon", you can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was removed from long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the Ministry's official data, compared to the period January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia has generally decreased by 7% to 22.9 miles, while the reported cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs have decreased by 7.8%.
United States: fast food and supermarket employees on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teens go through a cashier's job at McDonald's
In the last few days, a wave of protests has been taking place against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict if this wave is going to grow or get out of breath quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In addition to the modest increases in salaries for basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at a time when a pouring rain of sales grabbing millions of people fell on America and sometimes triggering esclandres.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs around the world 2.2 million people, left their jobs to organize strike pickets with left-wing trade unions and activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle classes.
Walmart markets everything: from diapers to shotguns to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many poorly paid employees at Walmart shop only in their workplace.
The price and choice of products have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its cheap products, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests asked for a salary increase, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who receives $9.5 per hour, it is a sum that he cannot afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average salary to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
It is 1.1% more of what it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred the entire wage increase on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would be 46 cents more.
They'll spend only $12.39 more in a year than now.
Walmart's supporters noted with satisfaction that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the shops from 8am in the evening to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items to the second.
His caisses made a total of 100 million transactions for the "Black Friday".
In an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post, Dan Fogleman's spokesman assured that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com' operation among many" on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York, and they were not about Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not much appreciated, which is why they are not yet located) but about McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food increases them over time, but on average, its basic employees earn $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one touches less than they do in this city.
For me it's inconceivable to live with that money in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the newspaper Wall Street Journal we find comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashiers and fast-food cooks be paid a minimum of $15 per hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters through harassment or dismissal.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, grabbing fast food remains a difficult task, and this, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous events were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the mid-day rally near Times Square's McDonald's with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of portions and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other prominent New York democrats, notably the candidate for Mayor Bill De Blasio who said that "we all have to support the fast food workers to get a fair salary and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food sector in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not to mention that not all were fast-food workers, who employed tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is currently difficult to tell whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"For the moment, we only manage to mislead the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to seeing augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google that unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
For the time being, humanity as a whole has remained at flat screen pixels and sometimes at touch level.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in control by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us?
- Although the Kinect has made physical interaction, a lot of things happen on flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The capture of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but performance, for now, not really.
We're trying to change that and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems running on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space around him.
Thus, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discreet, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a hand-held bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you that can?
You would do it with the word and with the gestures.
- Usually, I'm only talking.
- Oh, it's gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or does not do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like in modern cameras?
They lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the present generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would of course be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all the current technologies are quite good, adding work to algorithm designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution according to the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, gave the sensor touch a regular processing delay of between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction between man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but not needing to touch, to have more frames at the second.
- But don't we have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact an infrared transmitter and the second, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the curve of the cameras and see how this could help define the locations.
- As far as I can remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from a point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone hands raised is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transit" that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass from glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and this is what makes them strong (personal elements are the only ones you are seeing) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is one problem that opponents point their finger at: there is no tactile sensation!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It perfectly records the pressures!
But there are also technologies that are really meant to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the sensation, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the tips of the fingers.
There are also bracelets worn on the wrists that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with perspectives.
- And you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task below which it will take a long time to get to grips: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we only manage to deceive the brain moderately, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "L'avant-garde petersbourgeoise" dedicated to urban dwellers who are in advance, at the forefront of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene of St Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city border and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extrovert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all in red, which can be seen near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or in trendy parties and varnishes.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the Petrosbourgeois storytellers fundamentally social and philosophical, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the avant-garde Péternesbourgeois of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took in his hands a barbaric organ and he became the symbol of this instrument in St Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, philosophy and image as a bohemian.
- Kirill, why are you walking around the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
- I chose red as a designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the creator of image and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not grey provokes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my work was located.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of the old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free, in my genre, were misunderstood.
I started to be friends with the painters of the new wave, with the painters of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Puchinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be in the centre of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995, I took place in Pushkinskaya-10, where before the works a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NAMEs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sang songs that were easy to play back in tight jerseys, and among them were Igor Vdovin, now a fashionable composer.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg had a lot of shows before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at home that he received them.
Galérie "D137", Club "Griboyedov": these are repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees have gone there as regulars.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was organised in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named "Painter of the Year," and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it's easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very high timeliness and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum through the clowns."
The clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares to be like that.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the outside mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit his face out.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of Barbary's organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Who other than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can also be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be treated, delicate, liquid.
A disintegration of culture is occurring.
Before, people were divided into flocks, bohemian supporters loved one thing, denied them another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Every star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- They're people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sex and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles won't come and at the end of the day it's less management, less money, less everything.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that usually are the ones we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said: there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money precisely for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the reign of the good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand the culture well, but they understood that we had to keep the right experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they're out of the way, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and make a way for them.
Currently, it is the "rule of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in the sense that they honestly say that they don't take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time pushing.
We need cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are many curious people going to see exhibitions, concerts.
In our home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Delivering into Space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with earthlings on board set off in search of a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, if only by hypothesis.
" It's Venus and Mars, " says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the P.K. Chternberg State Astronomical Institute (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500 .
You can only live there at very high altitude or on Venus' orbit... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of small peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from earth varieties.
Then, insects, small reproductive drosophilic flies, were placed in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how an embryo developed in weightlessness.
We get a completely normal chick on the way out.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks acted in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We stared at them twice, then we gave up, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent to orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only board species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetuses into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
" It was still biosatellites and then it's the only experiment, " says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet possible directly in space.
It's not a big deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike beasts, man is capable, in principle.
Homo sapiens possesses abstract thought, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the women's body is what humanity has most precious.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would stand after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery.
" No one answered that question, " explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just one year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been twice in orbit and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
" And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights, " concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Centre: compulsory flight preparation stage.
Here, in zero buoyancy, the cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, water is comfortable but a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Little amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby evolves about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's belly, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it takes only 2 weeks.
" It's very little to forget, " says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the belly, the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Okay, let's just ignore that by relying on the delivery simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"And then?" asks Valeriy Poliakov to invite us to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the terrestrial attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscular system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special combination for training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely unsuitable", says the Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still a theory.
However, in time this will become a reality when the Earthlings go into their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their progeny born in space.
The head of the ISC (Superior Audit Institution for Public Finance) said: "The control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech " Švarc system") has failed because of politicians.
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and high-quality legislation but is lagging behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Institution for Public Finance, in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites Petr Nečas' approach to the " Švarc system" as an example of abusive practice.
The Prime Minister recently stated that the SDO would not interfere with contractors with controls, so is it permitted or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect to demand compliance with the law," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the legislation on public procurement in these two countries was compared.
What was it really about?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation, as well as a practice itself.
We have gathered all this together and although this monitoring procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and of better quality", but according to certain parameters, practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually elaborate more and more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to devote itself to the implementation of the law itself.
How can this project help you in practice and what is the result for you?
A common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify laws, lower and improve thresholds, where this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this goal.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by paperwork, that those looking for faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems concerning the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different way of organizing it?
As far as the institutions, like the ISC, are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is organised in a similar way, also has a council formed a little differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The competences are also, to a certain extent, similar, but with a certain degree of difference in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has such accounts at the level of the various Länder.
The ORH can only control federal money, which in our case corresponds to the resources of the state.
The public funds administered at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder' accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas Germany is often referred to as a model, but it certainly cannot be said that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, I'm sure not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we consider to be a model, is also facing a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has the amendment of the law on public procurement meant for you as an institution, and what effect has it already had?
As this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our control operations.
As we do ex post checks, we have to count with a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the time being, the process of preparing future controls - we have launched a new instrument for "detection of the risks of mismanagement" with which we have scrutinised almost 14,000 public contracts - these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed and the conditions of certain types of tendering procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more stringent and cannot be respected.
Already under the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the Regional Council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the contract law meant a breach of budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but not punish those who make formal mistakes without consequences for the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution for getting out of it?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called Švarc system - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say: "We will change the law and allow it, " but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing had happened.
The procurement law contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect the invitation to tender.
But it is also tragic that a bidder should be eliminated solely because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is lacking in us.
The roads are frozen in places, but most remain practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
The network, however, remains largely practical, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were this morning practical, but in frozen and snow-covered places.
Temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5° and -10°C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has stopped in the area and there is only a thin layer of snow left on the plains.
The ridges of the Metalliferous Mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service show that due to fog, visibility was reduced in locations.
The R6 fast track and the national roads in the region are now easy to use.
However, vigilance remains to be exercised, e.g. on some bridges whose surface can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also feasible.
There are still some of their sections of frozen snow leftovers and in traffic-laden places.
Especially in high-altitude areas, drivers need to be more vigilant.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Motorways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in Eastern Bohemia are threatened by the formation of ice and that snow layers packed with traffic can be found on roads in mountainous and high-altitude areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on the departmental and third category roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-laden snow is present on roads in high-lying areas.
In the eastern Bohemian region, the weather will be dry, mostly clear, with possible clouds.
It will blow a weak wind and temperatures will generally oscillate between -3° and +1°C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are now practical, although in places there is a need to be more vigilant and to adapt its behaviour to weather conditions.
It's freezing this morning, with temperatures varying from -3 °C to -9 °C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some routes of communication may be frozen.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information provided by the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway can be used almost without difficulty, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between km 80 and 131.
Most national roads are dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the South Pilsen district and in the Tachov district.
The departmental and third category lanes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on less frequented roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region at high altitude must now count with a thick and soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced the road maintenance staff to go to the field this night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In other parts of the region, most pavements can be used without difficulty.
" On the heights of the Šumperk district there are remnants of snow.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník should expect to meet at the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" pass a thick and soft snow layer " today told ČTK the head of road maintenance services of the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment carried out, the roads are now clear and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are easy to follow, however in the district of Šternberk the drivers should pay attention in the sections of the forest areas with the roads remaining wet.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
As early as this morning, the road maintenance services of North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, and therefore snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are no problems and roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow melt during the day, clear skies and freezing during the night.
From the main roads there are also reports of difficult conditions on national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have bent under the weight of snow until reaching the roadway.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we love to fall into.
In our group The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think that we are the only group able to collect a balance of positive energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December you set up a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It is a charitable action that we have been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Mayan calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
The day before, 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end when the Mayan calendar on Kiribati Island, which is in the Pacific Ocean, ends, in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had this idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded an anthem against the end of the world, entitled "End of the world canceled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
She is already very popular on YouTube, will we also hear her at these charity concerts?
Of course, everything in the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The anthems will also join at some point in the context of a very unique live programme of Czech television.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the video, Xindl X also sings...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other personalities of the Czech show-biz, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and whose realization we have been working on within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the Jedličkív Institute and offer them activities that interest and amuse them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music bands and performers will stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria, do you have them?
We have tried to develop a program that targets all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will stage Chinaski, Lesbian Support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
Details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year in the house of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once there in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of disabled people.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not that bad it looks like it's the first time.
We have five electric wheelchair members whose equipment must travel in the hold, of course we also rub a lot of luggage and boxes of instruments...
So far everything has more or less always gone well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything happened without problems.
Through your trips abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of accessibility for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have your experiences been so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have seen in Moscow that in the East all are still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to disabled people; there, it is not yet common for a person to travel alone in an electric chair in the center of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of persons with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to note that improvements and improvements continue to depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with a heavy disability to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of disabled people are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the cutting edge of progress!
Respect for the public and accessibility are one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers among us.
For the moment, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this band?
I started working as an educator at Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people ready to invest in something.
And since I am myself a musician (I play saxophone among other things), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Lá的a Angelovič says, we lost some control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in recent years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true, building ties with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to European Union grants, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
Few are the original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it is natural ...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take pity.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and thrive, provided they have the means to do so, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities manage to achieve something, it is not only a step forward for them but for society as a whole.
Isn't your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransigent in many areas and demand discipline.
But I think it's quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take the preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for the concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Lá的a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
That will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve bands and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the World Canceled" will be sung jointly.
The purpose of the concert is to bring together financial resources (up to CZK 25 million) to equip the Studeo Multifunctional Training Centre in Prague at the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket at this concert is 400 CZK, the entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as a twentieth member of the Agency, it is the second Member State of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, Poland's road to space began much earlier.
Already before the Second World War, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to refer, for example, to the A. Šternfeld conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde work entitled "Introduction to Astronautics".
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld obtained the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch awards in France for his book "Introduction to Astronautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books on this scientific discipline.
Gadomski has become a promoter of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution has been rewarded in particular by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the Moon.
As early as 1925, in Poland, a draisine was built to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also not clear whether the rocket should be used to propel or brake the rites.
The only known information on this trait is from the press of the time.
From 1933 Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was conducted by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It appears from the documents kept that this research had reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the search stopped.
In 1937, the drawings of a photoelectric fighter rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author called Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were aimed at the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all rocket technology projects were carried out by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, further work on aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish astronautic company Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne.
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problem, in which there are four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to astronautism.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that space research had a future.
In early 1956, the Polish astronautic company (PTA) made efforts to join the international astronautic federation (established in 1951) and in the autumn, the PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the PTA's first president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
Starting in 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the weather rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologicczna), which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This rocket, with a range of 1800 metres, was 80 cm long and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Subsequently an improved version was built, RM-1A and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-storey RM-2 rocket were started in the Bledov Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B the volume was 0.34 litres and in Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum range of all these types of equipment was 37 km.
In the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the aviation institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
Subsequently, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a COSPAR national committee two years later are worth mentioning.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in the space exploration on the Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision raised a strong debate in public opinion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to examine this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalist economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means in concrete terms that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free (without limits) movement of private capital, combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create a price tension.
Under this term, a producer is trying to import low-priced goods to resist economic competition by "making the competitor's price more expensive", with the aim of removing a greater share of the market and thereby increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying cheaply, or disappearing. The result is a high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the state's social charges necessarily increase.
This situation intensifies the perfect unwillingness of businessmen to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to society as a whole by this race for profit.
This situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the various economies in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population with the aim of attracting foreign capital to them.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to the laws in force.
The aim is to force its own population to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the area of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by restricting the rights of employees in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, for years there have been public food distribution points for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
There are already millions of such people.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has, for example, been updated in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of virtually all the southern EU Member States are undoubtedly generating a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to subjugate with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital will invest in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will go from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turk, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also concerns Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theory and the media say, getting tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the directed economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not, according to its own selfish interests, lead politics and by the same, the entire state.
The answer to this question is certainly yes.
The evidence is that there is a virtually all-powerful lobby present in all States.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, through the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that, due to the lack of financial resources, the national ministries delegate the preparation of draft laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then adopted in the Bundestag.
The entire power does not come from the people, as Western-style constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalist democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State had long been in a state of collapse and functions were attributed by violence.
The bribes, the favors obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
It was true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absoluteist regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, regardless of the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
The result, today as in the past, is a decadence without precedents for elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
As things stand, we can see the disappearance of these systems in favour of liberal democracies as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elites are completely unaware of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future loss of life, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and internally in Europe, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of Chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and will never be able to," says Sting in the song entitled Fragile whose main verse of the chorus is "let's not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be no wars," said Gutele Schnaper, Mayer Amschel Rothschild's wife on his deathbed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, there have been many reactions.
Some take Israel's side, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a point of view "behind the curtain", on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have persisted for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available for study, others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, who is the main instigator of the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individuals acted independently or whether they owed their actions to the throne to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we are living in a time when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been possible in a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
From the 1990s to the 19th century, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) in order to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts in which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortunes or both.
They own major stakes in almost all the central banks of the world and prepare or wage wars against countries in which they do not yet have such stakes (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, Russia meanwhile placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of the Rothschilds the status of central bank and began to issue his own money during the civil war (government, I hear well) and was assassinated in a theatre in 1865.
JFK started issuing clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 when he wanted to sue the EDF for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for world power led in the 1859s to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated in the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate Europe's great state monarchies, the second was to eliminate colonialism, especially the British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families headed by the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent the recurrence of crises such as those they caused in 1907).
After having succeeded in triggering the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended with a German capitulation without economic and military justification (war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
To facilitate the outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed heavy war reparations on Germany, thus generating the conditions for the radicalisation of the impoverished masses (they then had to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing at the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority who had to play the role (which it effectively held) of fifth column to set fire to the powders and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour declaration mentioned above laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if everything he had done was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel lit a firehouse that could cause a third world war.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (it is enough to see how people divide bitterly between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where harm causes another harm according to an endless circle of violence and where we find, at the origin of everything, the greed of some individuals and their desire to acquire power over the whole world?
Here we have to distinguish between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as in our home, international bankers offer people in elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does everything in order to trigger a war with Iran, which could, because of the country's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc....) expand to become a global conflict and, since Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor is only 2 miles wide) and causes destruction of the world economy.
Under what light now appears David Rockefeller's 1994 speech: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of finance aristocrats are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth into an electronic chip making him a totally controlled being.
" Let them compel all individuals, small and great, rich and poor, free and bonded, to bear a red - iron mark on their hand or forehead, so that they may not buy or sell the one who does not bear the name of that ferocious beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood that the one who has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number is the man and it's six hundred and sixty six."
The Argo movie: when everything goes to the worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of protestors made up of Islamist students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had been supporting his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the American administration a positive outcome, it could not abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously undermined the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow for the prestige of the United States, further aggravated by the fiasco of the attempt to free hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate gave rise to a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed strongly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offered America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the Canadian ambassador's residence.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rock cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make spottings for a big science fiction film.
Combination of genera
The exfiltration expert Tony Mendez's plan required Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were organized and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
On the one hand, it is a political thriller conceived realistically but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful coup, of a treachery - as, for example, in the trilogy Ocean's even, twelve and thirteen.
The atmospheres follow one another: sequences of Tehran in documentary style (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and the way in which, thanks to these photos, these same situations were transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the hallways and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting game ceased to arouse ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark policeman " Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first Affleck film that does not take place in its original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo, where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in the fictitious scenes (the fake filming team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to content himself with a subject offering in fact few exciting scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He is doing very well, he sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in its dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks some dramatic tension, it lets itself be seen with moderate interest, appreciating the realization and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story still, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the trick.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public survey of the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas coming from the most absurd "EU workshop".
"The fact that the EU has recently planned to adopt a 40 percent quota of women for the management of large European companies has been the reason for our decision," said the newspaper Právo, the organiser of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
To date, however, women have had an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk to insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticism has also been expressed in the past against the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimetres.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose demands are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (for example, the Czech Republic currently imposes the demands of its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of the pressure groups are also, for example, responsible for the fact that bananas in the Union must not be smaller than 14 cm or have an "abnormal curvature".
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was only harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that the existing directives lead to a waste of food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation that must include a warning on inflatable balloons that children under the age of 8 must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU referred to an American investigation that balloons are among toys the leading cause of death of children by choking.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 with respect to blowing in fair trumpets.
We've got weird ideas in our house, too.
The following rule concerning European officials themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Leave Doing" of liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com has named in this survey, in addition to certain absurdities mentioned above, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then, for example, removed the volumes fixed for canned mushrooms and, as a result, was liable to a heavy fine.
The survey organizers found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant to apply for grants.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
"The fact of not having a sea handicaps us.
We are going to ask the European Union for a refund." Thus, in autumn 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the period Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, because of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had subsequently had to export.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for obtaining grants were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which were to be used in practice to draft applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU says: "Foreign regulations are rare".
While the regulations often give rise to criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its general development are rather praiseworthy.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of the use of EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which have been imposed by Member States in budgetary negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions among the Czechs.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarŽžky", for what of the name "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to us in the nineteenth century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar alcohol products, not beet sugar products, may bear the name rum.
In the EU's official list of registered products, we can now find together with world-famous cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck's marzipan or Parma ham, Karlovy Vary's biscuits ("Karlovarské Suchary"), Pohořelice and Třebos carp ("Pohořelický a Třeboský kapr") and Žatec hop ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubický perník (Pardubický perník) and the cakes called "Hořice horns" ("hořické rubičky") can also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura.
Senator, how do we get the idea of running for the presidential election?
It's not about being a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be a candidate anywhere.
But I can't bear to see how looted the country has been for the last 20 years, that thieves are not locked up and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I'm trying to find a way to make it change.
And since I'm over forty years old and I'm an independent member of no party, I have no other way to influence the situation than to run for office in the presidential or senatorial elections.
You entered the Senate but you quickly set out for the Castle (N.D.T.: seat of the Presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said I'll start the battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected a senator, I would run for the presidential election.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we grumble at the bar or in front of our television station, but also that we trample on those who are trying to bring about change.
To this is added the press that breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, it has been said about me that I bribe journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek's adviser.
Let's go to your visions.
You have started the fight for the Castle with as a battlehorse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [CZK].
To this end, you must change the law.
As president, you do not have such a power, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, put pressure on tourism guide activities to be a liberal profession, I won.
The problem is politics: when someone comes to the left or to the right with a good project, it is deliberately refused and it delays the citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to have the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and partisan dogma, to take from each side what is best for our country and implement it.
You think you're a man on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me on the left.
For me, whether it's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you get mad when someone says you're a populist?
But doesn't what you said prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have an optimal goal and vision.
You're trying to get closer to it.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals that I'm talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about them.
But without the support of Parliament, you only have slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with that.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will, for example, succeed in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I must convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my side in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to rebroadcast on television my request to the presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then eventually explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality who will identify abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the President by direct suffrage, it was obtained through the pressure of public opinion.
I confess, without ambiguity, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to get the majority's support for my program.
I'm trying, alone, to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and return to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can't make a difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for the Senate as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil frauds.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty percent of the people did not vote, and most of the people who did did so gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you considering founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether the past of each potential member is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have any money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
Don't you have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property at about 60 million.
I have in Prague a plot of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving by car, was gallant with women and was fighting evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a 60 million worth of assets and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic, but you don't want to invest your own money?
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested two and a half million dollars in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying for my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I would not run for any election.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you'd be deafening your activities?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, in the spring, my deputy will take over the direction of the travel agency.
People would like me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live with something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and kept winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business activities.

The architects of the firm MVRDV prove that the real adventures are not only a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, you just have to contemplate Spijkenisse and the mountain of newly erected books - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it is very futuristic, finally something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building".
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes to one of these ringuard libraries of his own free will, no?
Spijkenisse, a dormant city that has nothing to do with Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to restore some neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro notes in the form of pretty small miniatures in painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
Thus the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, of the architect's office in Rotterdam MVRDV, master of diagrams in bold sticks and creator of buildings full of mind and often cynical, accepted the project with his usual phlegm and presented himself to the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a laugh on his face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, disconcerted and uplifting their shoulders, Maas, the frightful, stacked his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and finished his speech supported by militant arguments with one: "common auction!"
Here it is, my proposal for the book mountain of Spijkenisse, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has come out of the earth.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 homes.
At the beginning of November, the book mountain was awarded the second Best Library of NL 2012 prize.
In addition, the project was selected for the 2012 Dutch National Wood Award.
Thus, this dull little village, which until today had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and a town hall with an amazing ugliness, whose white facades suggest that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
Most importantly, Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to reading
First impression: Eldorado of the cheese bell book.
Of course, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the real joys of reading and architecture open to you when you tread the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the Dutch brick floor and the elegant street lights speak unequivocally the language of municipal public squares.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Normally, library shelves are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," says Willy Maas.
We have completely changed the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the book mountain has been adeptly arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even hardened architects and engineers don't want any unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
One day we found in a Frisian farm an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, the synthetic membrane of one millimetre thick has been used for many years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimetres.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic " (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 meters, the literary café offers a breathtaking view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot ficuses.
The latter create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the New Soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecological project," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only brightens the interior for a short time, even on days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass facade serve as sun visors, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The ambient atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septician, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "soul finally recovered".
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This has made it possible to fill the voids of the library which was not yet fully stocked (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I think our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline that is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spijkenisse wrote a new page of literary history.
Even though she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status with the United Nations.
But then she chose to abstain.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but was not too critical of Israel.
During the insurgency in Libya in March 2011, Germany also chose to abstain in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
Finally, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy so much defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans thus face several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including on national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, hence by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and its abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany first has important opportunities in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive factor in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany damage its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think that Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I think that the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be more respected.
Germany has thus shown that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions about the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do opinions differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly showing great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, publicly defend its position.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you observe the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from exceedingly enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think it makes things easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore form part of a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
That is what they are doing now in the question of the euro.
In my view, Germany will assume a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
It is not simple for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that further marks their independence.
Does Germany have a role to play as a major player on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does she still have difficulty taking on leading roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking at, for example, the euro crisis, we note that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things easy for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
She has to deal with a wide variety of neighbours and opinions, and it's not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment, the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is this really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but which has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing its name cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she'd win.
"It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer with Taylor Wessing, who specializes in violating property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few more letters to register their marks.
Thus, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also being legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a binder in which the recordings made at the Beijing trademark office are located.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by taking over part of the name Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and intellectual property infringement.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell almost only counterfeits.
Pattloch's cases are, however, different: its applicants direct him to address the fact that the Chinese trademark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai", a relative brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan".
It is with this term that women who marry rich men are referred to.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," Pattloch demands.
"The brand is sweetened, singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the world's third largest luxury market and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to remove doubtful registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality".
Pattloch explains to us that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay the plagiarist money because he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal battle against the construction company Sany, the same company that had just purchased the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
The Volvo Acquisitor Geely used a blue and white logo that reminded BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiars of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits, however, that it experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, last year the Office would have moved from an "emergency situation in the course of work to a normality regained".
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases would have been closed, an increase of 75% over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Taking action is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received over 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record, and this means that China is the tenth consecutive leader in the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal trademarks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
"It's our fault, because last names cannot be protected in Germany," says Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Trademark Office had therefore rejected the Munichers' objection.
Freudenberg certainly won in the next two instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is necessary
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and boasts the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "the procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to estimate internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opposing party a "large sum in euros with six digits" to settle the dispute.
"That's what we see for ourselves," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow into Europe.
This would be the case if imitators in this region ensured the exploitation of unprotected trademarks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to file in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "the vigilance is in order".
Pattloch and he advise German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law; rather, foreigners should "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much higher than the costs of registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of its legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of its own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the segment of the market in question.
World AIDS Day: kicking, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and Swaziland's AIDS orphans rejoice at their arrival.
This is the story of a link that crosses much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometres.
First of all, we hit the foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, escarpins for ladies and moccasins for men seek the rhythm by hitting the ground of the foot. Very quickly, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they are carried away, bewitched and followed each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost loses his canvas shoes when he leads the orchestra with his wildly flexible gestures.
It's Monday night, the Imbongi choir repeats a new song in the music room of Heidelberg's Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 came, from geneticist in human medicine to man in the home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping each other
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, estimates that 34 million people around the world are suffering from the disease.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected people.
In addition, more than 40% of the population is HIV positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend secondary schools.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for the school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal in the gogo centre.
Imbongi means in Zulu "teller of stories" or even "singer of praise".
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but all can sing it.
For nearly 10 years, the choir has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to return to its native region: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres away from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, as HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the ills that afflict Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure which guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of Swaziland's population carries the immunodeficiency virus and it is not uncommon to die in the middle of the 30s.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir was able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who were missing not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, they were only a few people who personally pledged to pay a few euros each year in order to be able to send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa", an association that has since been working almost professionally on AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and blennorrhea (or gonorrhea).
Common STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubis lice and scabies belong to parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), gonnorrhea, and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of spread of HIV between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed in this group.
In young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections are among young people aged 15 to 25.
Moreover, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: from 1.967 in 2001 to 3.698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth from the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and the appearance of buds and warts.
However, they do not regularly cause pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason for this is that sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close body contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person often changing sexual partners take regular examinations.
Most rapidly detected STIs can be cured and late sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that choristers collect through their voices throughout Germany, the resources are accumulating.
"In all, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages money from Germany.
She also ensures that orphans are well housed, for example in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, which are called old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school every day in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed to a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two henhouses. With the help of the American organization for health PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many residents.
This is not self-evident, for even though the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it's a subject that affects sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus throughout the country.
However, condoms are found in every corner of the street, says Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culture is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi's choirs travel together every two or three years to the South of Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many people from the tip of the black continent are still experiencing during apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in the African language is such a sign of gratitude that it not only generates good mood and joy, but sometimes also tears a few fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godson.
Even though it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," the people say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers to the bird's flight, back in Heidelberg, in front of the singers who hit the foot in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be as thick as 20 metres.
The American space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science".
The Messenger probe reported evidence of an ice cover in the region of the planet permanently immersed in the shadows.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres, up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or perhaps from asteroids that would have struck Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-critical elements have arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unseen by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which we observe infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet", according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, harder to identify, are the "new-born" in the birthroom of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars, called "W5", were born, a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a star dying.
The donut-shaped circle consists of elements that the star throws when it dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, at 5.400 light years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
Pleiades, clusters of stars also called "the seven sisters", can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colours.
In this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light-years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
His resemblance to an earthly continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular hue.
Only the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest enigmas of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the largest and clearest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the colour, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Nebula of the Trifide in the constellation of Sagittarius, thousands of light years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), for three dust tracks divide the shiny heart from the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers have photographed the first fruits of a cosmic carbbling in the constellation of the Serpentary: 400 million light years from the Earth, the nuclei of two molten galaxies rush towards each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "southern light wheel".
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Cepheus.
The nebula is located at 1,400 light-years and consists of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than common domestic dust.
This photo was developed from the optical and radiographic photographs taken by different telescopes.
We can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light years away from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The heavenly cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These clouds of stars, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also permanently create young stars at 5,000 light-years from the Earth.
In this galaxy with light rays and a small black hole, there is no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after bigbang, when the universe was largely hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have grown steadily and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope of the Mount Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, U.S.A., is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also attached to the vertical angle.
Its particularity lies in its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is close to those of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico).
This radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by using the computing power of their machine.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO), in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of nearly 1,000 elements of mirrors.
However, the telescope will not be able to take photographs until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors each with a diameter of 10 metres.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 metres.
This illustration makes it possible to admire it.
However, the most important space images come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for exoplanets, mainly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space as early as 2018 on an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that Mercury's South Pole is also home to ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to Mercury's North Pole.
Radar data have been showing the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a sprained romanticism.
At the corner of the many turns of the road, the small bus cahoots along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group is living by the name of Talysh, about which little is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town plastrons with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era that does not at all agree with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too difficult.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, 48-year-old Pilata Fatulayeva is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of this kind in the world.
We can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh from the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather. He's 120 years old.
Having a child at 136 years of age
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when one thinks that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, Müslümov's age seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. At the age of 136, he would have conceived a girl again.
Would Müslümov have been mistaken for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard about man in the early age of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly old people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," Scholz explains, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, it is impossible to establish scientific evidence because of the non-existence of the documents, not to mention that there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, it is true that people in the Lerik area often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that Talysh have special genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it is a matter of food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem plausible that Talysh's calorie-rich meals, which love meat, bread and especially dairy products, many of which drink a glass of melted butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor next to a barette, the contents of which she beat tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and one daughter, who have long been an adult.
Two little children are also gambiting in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadu glasses in the shape of the belly.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his scarf are hidden long braids of a dark blond which his son reveals with pride.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I've never lost them and kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," adds Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took control.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, a man who led his country as a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not experience distress.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (about the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long greying son is right: "Seniors enjoy great respect in our culture".
They are the center of the big family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "human rights" omitted in the Constitution
The revolution is reborn in Cairo.
Competing demonstrations reveal the country's deep fracture.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not smitten with words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
For all members of the confused and desperately disunited opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 hastily written articles by the majority Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night tour of force are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that jurisprudence is based on "the principles of Islamic law".
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a question of interpretation, and there are good grounds for fear that Islamists will use the vague wording and the resulting legal leeway to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested by a newly introduced article which states that, with regard to all subjects relating to Shariah, Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its radiance radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will supervise the legislative system, which would de facto lead to the supervision of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's reign, these courts tried to crack down on opponents.
After the dictator's fall, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The State must also, it says, protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
In addition, there is no explicit guarantee of equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids offending or defaming the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally dubious is the formulation suggesting that it is forbidden to "offend persons".
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi submits to the vote and which, in his own words, will "very soon" be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
"The Revolution Reborn"
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
On Friday night, tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered in unusual harmony on Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it came into force.
"The revolution is reborn and we will win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential elections.
The Nobel Peace Prize and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei declared that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the trash of history".
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, he will go to his palace and be overthrown," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet expiated," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges have announced that they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and the supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, claiming that "the Qur'an [was their] constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic place Terir, where it all began, would soon have created a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, like its supporters, had expressed themselves loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot box what direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and encompassed all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights were indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are stark violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto takes away all his powers," Saeda deplores.
However, a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, which looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could pay off.
A protestor in Tharir Square warns: "you are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: is it the most smelling fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country's success be linked to local appetite for an extremely smelly fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the little town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this ubiquitous smell permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - that can go up to a year.
When darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary specialty.
"You eat raw, then you swallow a drink of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," added Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid putting it under your nose, it's not bad - it sounds like a sushi that would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a period when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was immersed in airtight water barrels and then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish came out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mainly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
This is one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often make her talk about itself in international news, which is not to displease her.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about "the July 22 incident."
The Norwegians find it difficult to accept that in their peaceful country one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason that justifies our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and in the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plateau in her hand.
We are - how do you say - cautious people.
His English, like most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw the money out of the windows, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway managed to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
"As long as you can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"Without forgetting the rakfisk," she adds in a careless laugh.
I stand up under the snow and line up to buy something to eat - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a burger composed of momentum, a real discovery, is excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I am staying is one of the many places where one serves rakfisk for dinner and where one can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most odorous of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a node, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision competition.
"What score did you score for the best fish in the Thor-Juergen mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish emanations.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, BBC's Will Grant is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad at present.
In a city where traffic jams are widespread in normal times, a security dam has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, the results that are owed to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is in the throes of a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the US President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and tentacular state that enshrines the capital. On its land of choice, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic commune of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of M Pena Nieto, a major improvement has been made to these roads, once bumpy and full of crevices.
Plates bearing its name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so much needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years away from the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticisms of opponents who blamed the new president for lack of charisma.
He is a whole man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image of the people of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the autoponts of the highways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight the drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a notorious place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto's critics say that, at best, he failed to stem the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says Señora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and cadaveric rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross where the word "Justice" appears.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me as if I were an old lady, a troublemaker, a whiny girl.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope that he will be as good as he was when he was governor," said Olvera in Valle del Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about ill-treatment, the prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter claims of ill-treatment allegedly suffered by Bradley Manning during detention.
The trial involved the detention of Manning in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of causing the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- has missed many opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During a cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints regarding his treatment.
The cross-examination -- during a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring the Manning case to be closed on the grounds that the kidnapping was carried out under very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified to his desire to commit suicide while in detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning had been their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in Quantico Military Prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that his guards' treatment was "excellent" and that his treatment in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had orally expressed concerns about certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems raised.
"They wrote "no problem" (after addressing concerns), but that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury".
The members stated that they had assigned him this restrictive status -- a level below close surveillance for risk of suicide -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know I was okay, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to enjoy a better quality of life from my point of view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not aware of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items he had at his disposal were mattresses, blankets, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying during the day was contrary to the rules.
Manning also said that when he was trying to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint regarding Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Levenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of the guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with a blanket during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had deduced from his guard's order that he should release his cover that could have hidden his nudity, but he admitted that no one had ordered him to let go.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his briefs or flip-flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, flip-flops, and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is convicted before a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defence stated that Manning intends to plead guilty to the least serious offences and to fight for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Charges against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of national defence information.
If all counts are held, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says that many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
The Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind the Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says that Mexico-Americans find themselves caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, arriving in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Signs indicated two ways: one for "Mexiconos" ("Mexicans"), and the other for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I remained motionless for several seconds, not knowing what line I was heading for.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the Mexican my whole life.
It's an ethnic qualifier, just like the one my Boston friends use when they say they're "Irish," or my New York friends when they say they're "Italian."
Then I became Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth that saw my grandfather born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have the vocabulary of an Aboriginal person, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade along the lines of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give up half of their territory in writing at the tip of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who reflect in terms of centuries, and no minutes, memories are everywhere.
As a result, as soon as a U.S. official makes any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbour.
And Montezuma's kids are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the country's more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about bitterness?
There's a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer them.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a typical profile -- dark skin, poorly educated, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even if we are currently living the American dream, we have gone to good schools and we have good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream we are living, and not the Mexican dream.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
Moreover, we know that part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they blind us as if we were individuals of inferior origin and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not end up stuck on the bright side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally emigrated to the United States while she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between Mexicans and Mexico Americans, as Mexicans claim their identity more firmly and Mexico Americans are upset.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels she is part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexico-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of one country or the other.
We love the music of the Mexican band Los Tigers del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico-Americans to work as makeshift ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to handle yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican Americans still resent the way in which their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexicans than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Can there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is in vain.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings were reduced to dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although the Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in the midst of a transformation.
The Arab Spring has made everything fly, whether or not it is desired, Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them to break this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas' leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will boast of forcing the Israelis to give up, even though Gaza has been beaten.
Having killed some of its leaders and evicted the 1.7 million Gazans into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once Israel's closest Muslim ally, has taken the cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Hamas members gloat and say that the Islamic crescent bends around Israel, from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, passing through Syria, where Islamist-oriented rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and up to Jordan, where Hamas' allies threaten the king.
And the most important, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are more likely to rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been boxed.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being at the root of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel prospered, notably under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rocket fire from Gaza has killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been spared by suicide bombings, including the separation barrier that is encroaching on the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party merged with an even more bellicist party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman as he approached the election on 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why pamper these damn Palestinians by giving them a state?
If they were running the West Bank, would they not launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they come out of their heads.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but the Arab spring may change the deal.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not appreciate Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is a good augury -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder keg that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakens democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those on the outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outsiders to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs from outside countries should also put pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Obama also has an interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term in office, he did not present his own peace plan.
Returning to the White House, he seemed equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Packages of Cigarettes have come into force in Australia
Warnings and pictures of sick organs cover the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the brand.
This law entered into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced by a dark olive green and horrific pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the name of the brand, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the strictest tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government stated that the goal was to discourage young people from smoking by removing glamorous portrayals.
Studies have shown that if people did not start smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess."
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said this would boost black market trade, which will make it easier to access cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be negative consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Forgers in China and Indonesia will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that this law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, said that the demand for cigarette cases, including silicone to mask horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's high court.
Ha said that Zico has sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV ads, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local companies and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you work in tobacco marketing and you only have a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the key place to be," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in contributions from some lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has bothered to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulation rather than marketing.
Industry went so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries have had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More stringent laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don't bother me.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put it away," said Victor El Hage when he bought a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna stop is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacconist" in central Sydney, said that uniformity of packaging makes it difficult to store packages on display.
"Before, I needed an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising his arms in heaven.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period, because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the issue of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll come back.
First of all, like many people, I thought that boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, they date back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined and debated in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After going through many publications and submitting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but without succeeding in engaging in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task although they would like to.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do something.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, associated with a grim mood and the feeling that time is slowly passing."
The boredom can be very much like depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that while both may be related, people who are bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while people who are depressed think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we sometimes think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the newspaper "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, a person's voice reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, coming from the room next door, the too high sound of a TV show that had no connection, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but did not know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, a break in attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you perform a boring task, "like watching objects on a montage line, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you twist or scratch, these gestures, often seen as signs of boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to giggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay without moving," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored one day or the other - the delay of my plane flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Schedule of predisposition to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and particularly need many and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of adolescents reported being bored at school and during their homework, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not in school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's percentage of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level", especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"Need is the way the brain has found to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't be bored anymore, but he won't have learned to care for himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation moves from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant bubbling generated by activities and technology is the goal we should strive to achieve.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but boredom arouses an acute and frantic desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy stopping times.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: possession of marijuana pellets and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day, in September, he and some friends were in a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons to appear for possession of drugs and materials that could be used for his use - minor offences, each with a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated as criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is it?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on location than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of offences involving the use of marijuana have been classified without further action.
The police have stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative ridings have called for speeding up existing marijuana cases and continue to charge those who own them.
At the same time, several cities in the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales businesses in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so quickly that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's chief of police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators also have a lot of questions.
They are seeking guidance on how to install a permit system, authorizing production, manufacture, distribution and sale - before the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most states in the regulation of marijuana, first with respect to therapeutic use and now with respect to personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, Smith admits, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington law, called I-502, came into effect on December 6, leaving a one-year legal vacuum, during which the licensing system still did not exist, while possession of marijuana would be legal.
In the meantime, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees proper access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the establishment of cannabis sales shops within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or crèche.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an approved cannabis trade, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the recently formed Cannabis Legalization Centre.
On 21 November, the chief of police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the "City Attorney" (a representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office) would no longer prosecute persons 21 years of age or older who possess small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging persons for this type of offence "with immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would enforce new court decisions that regulate the activities of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the "district attorney" (Procureur de la République), Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily to pressure users to get detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute these people who committed an offence that, at the time of the incident, was a recognized offence," Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters have rejected the marijuana-restricted initiative.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer summon adults for possession of limited quantities.
The county prosecutor's representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss all cases of marijuana detention without further action.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time continuing to apply the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing a legal and government framework appropriate for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities highlight the profound ambivalence among local officials with regard to the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents people accused of marijuana use and speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent much of their lives prosecuting people who used marijuana, so they find it hard to accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat the restricted use of marijuana at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and the state of Washington are becoming a case law for the legalization of drugs.
While advocates and government officials are planning a new border for legalized sales, they are anxiously awaiting the direction of the federal government, which still views the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give in.
Despite some media arrests of patients on therapeutic marijuana and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed the sale of marijuana for therapeutic purposes to take place in Colorado, Washington, D.C. and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are probably not going to break down the doors to seize small sachets of drugs, there is a strong bet that they are opposed to licensed personal-use marijuana sales businesses authorized by the new laws," said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for the federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments have approved moratoriums on the establishment of new marijuana sales outlets, even though this is a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a 6-month moratorium, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then face a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in community voting rather than state voting.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mistreated and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
It is not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and my older brother have studied in what was an eminent place for me to know, a kind of Greek amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were disconcerted.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university, because I objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson stated facetically that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been bullied and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one single reason, and in this cradle of so-called knowledge, I was a victim of racist and barbaric behaviour: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a Conservative Party supporter.
Why are you talking about this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of centre-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, as well as those of gays, persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Student Hall (JCR) of Corpus Christi College stated that they were "often isolated, attacked personally and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want to have a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent documentary on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", devoted to student politics, which portrayed "Tories" as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
Student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels as a Rolls-Royce, has a silver finish and travels with a chromed head rod.
In other universities, conservative students claim to be treated as scapegoats in the introduction of higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "there is a growing left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us."
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for greater protection, said that such a climate was "uneasy," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, president of the OUCA, said that there had been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards people who were centre-right.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way in my first few weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and had paralyzing shyness.
The hatred of the Conservative party was very virulent.
The previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was charged with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met with the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I found that not only did teachers participate in the sarcasm towards Tory students, but they also enjoyed it.
It was as if the policy on strike miners, privatization and the government's opposition to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was engraved in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm of which I was a victim concerned a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, easily took off.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy making friends," he said in a haughty tone.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and felt a slight pat on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student in English, named James, who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claim to be Labourers.
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I disagreed with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This ploy failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic science who, ironically, had studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students took over the chorus.
I was perverted, filthy.
"How do Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, don't they?"
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Could I only lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?
Should I have become a Labourer and denied my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only open-minded professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a Conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a position as a professor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' house in London, finding refuge with my family and my urban friends more open-minded.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said pathetically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the city with dreamy bell towers.
Even my communist friends had irreproachable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and renounced his convictions.
In a work session led the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Internally roaring with shame, I admitted to being the victim of my parents' brainwashing and called them "old fools."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who broke the last nail of my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I stayed taped in my room, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I've never been back.
You can call me a whiny chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but also enjoyed an unwavering reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: Un Maître de la Couture ", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 models of haute couture created for his sewing house over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the organ of a story whose only protagonist is "he knows" Garavani, but who could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, by Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as trophies of his social ascent: from the modest designer of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet as some pop stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of the beauties of the past like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Spanish square in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
One could see and feel his mind in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never go through fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
Noble lineage parade
Garavani's life is not about obsessions but about shared love.
He likes well-educated people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a 60-metre-wide glamorous podium that offers to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the mannequins and must march on the podium to admire a dream "public" bearing Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, Monica Vitti's costume in "La Notte", or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among this audience of models are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Rosario de Bulgaria and Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the designer in 2006
Many of his clients say that Valentino's first clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget".
I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, shirts, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-72 collection.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all others for his femininity, his great love of women, and because he sublimates our beauty," Feria's ex-Duchess adds.
I like the colors he uses, they're bright and bright on the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The Princess and Modest Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg, too, cannot forget the first time she has worn a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of being old and having the opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped buster and a falling neckline.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg preserves the designer's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories she conveys".
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer thus calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with inlays of pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a trail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late twentieth century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obsessed for years by the "knowledge-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani has as many honours as any husband of his clients.
"His refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance have always jumped into my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails.
There are people for whom work is a hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living wearing the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano in eastern Indonesia's Java island.
He must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth's bowels solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through the steep trails.
There are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano that peaks at 2,386 meters above sea level, but the worn-out porters take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, at a tortoise-like look, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once at the top, he makes a way between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus beasts, and painfully carrying the heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company installed a little below at 1,850 meters altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, as we can say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it at 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry since this ore is very present in daily life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even used to bleach sugar.
"As we carry about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and ends exhausted, but it allows him to win 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is the triple of what he would gain in the fields.
"The income of the miners is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is 2 million rupees (167 euros), " says the porter who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was Rs 75,000 (6.20 euros) a day and the job wasn't as difficult, but Anto returned to her family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that in Indonesia is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but sulphur has already begun to make him pay the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Maltreated by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unsanitary wooden masure with other bearers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulphur does not cease to spring at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defying the darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp fixed to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the wearers who work on their own and are paid by weight.
In addition, they do not receive a sub of the 30,000 rupees (EUR 2.50) of mark-up per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (EUR 1.20), which the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years, since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, between the ages of 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulphur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains of suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, 53-year-old Unainik can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," says Unainik, opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The eldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a bearer of sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation, one of the most difficult occupations in the world: the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame this lack of children for the career, stress and cost of accessing property.
"Singapore's people must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pellets, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a drag of powder on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a policinelle in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency at the origin of the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to ensure that people fulfilled "their national duty."
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we were able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a theme we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things, such as throwing perfumes at pheromones or organizing speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we said the following: What's more creative about solving this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
It spends US$1,300 a year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered to be the rate of renewal, was in 1976.
Why, then, do Singaporeans not have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the increase in the number of single women and to the delaying of marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
In the meantime, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in xenophobia barely disguised against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore last year experienced its worst election results since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to monitor the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", which can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, managing director of the EL Developers real estate company, claims that its "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are being built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it's much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously put in the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre, it would seem that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people put it to a later stage," says a young executive.
Other people can have children.
"But for me, it's important to be able to dispose of my money and my time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children.
Thus, while the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion".
What is private for those under 16 years of age?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper ElPeriódico interviewed five young boys, between the ages of 10 and 15, who used the web frequently.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with the "password and username" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my pictures or someone who would be a fool," he said.
The young boy recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, denuded people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures that he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family.
Her mother is one of them, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept an unknown person's request.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
The case of José, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits he does not know 20 people on his list of friends.
"It doesn't worry me because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made any advances or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyberharassment are not alien to the young boy.
A friend of mine was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close his account.
"He only passed it in a private profile."
He then explains a series of manipulations to set up his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if I was angry or angry.
"Even though I know it's cyber-harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Natives and Digital Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives, children and young people were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He added that the theme was complex, "because we ask them to have a definite criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they are not mature enough to do so".
"We also ask them to be selective while what matters most to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents confidentiality is to use questions that make them think.
"Their saying not to do it is of no use," she says.
Then Porras lists some examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify holiday photos, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Out of the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and education adviser, said that it was essential for parents to read carefully the conditions for the use of social networks.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that we must not talk to strangers.
The Unasur summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration being made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe has tried several times to access the document signed at the Sixth Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially reported that it would be disclosed after the conclusion of the summit, and then claimed that it would be published from one moment to the next on the Peruvian government's website.
When questioned about the text, they reported that its content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The lack of information between journalists was the information given by press officers of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media calling for more important information.
Later, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was called for in the press, it had also not circulated the declaration also called the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited to the maximum the obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement between Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court which determines a different border between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and stated that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the pleas of both parties in the trial that Lima brought against Santiago, which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we have today before this international court," said President Humala, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of controversies, treaties and international tribunals," said President Piñera, giving a hand to President Humala, next to the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Pact of Bogota by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on maritime boundaries with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was tasked with opening the deliberations in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the lines of action for 31 projects had been established between South American countries for a total investment of $17 million.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of Unasur would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that action would be taken to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, to improve access to medicines, to access the Internet at low prices throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalistic matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people", concluded President Humala.
"We decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru and were on the transversal axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two were aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any more details.
Similarly, the final document mentions the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that this country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and with good relations with its neighbours, is another theme addressed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a judgement of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to revise all these ways, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua which is going to ask for a discussion with this country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are going to settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," said President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City where they plan to attend the takeover of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, at the summit, the defence ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe".
President Correa, who participated in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), located in Lima, said on state television, TV Péru, that Europeans "had killed each other during the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the plan to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador expressed his support for the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears never compromise anything, but we, the South Americans, have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington under the financing of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected".
In addition, he criticizes the Swedish courts, which demanded that he be interrogated on his territory about an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish legislation allows him to do so by video-conferencing, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
It is possible that his physical and mental health may deteriorate by being locked in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects the health of anyone," he concludes.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe conduct to allow him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities and stressed that he had had discussions in London in order to find a solution to the closure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings in various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe driving from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as fully permitted by its legislation, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression".
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malevolent or perverse politicians, but the bad journalists who pay for greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this perspective, he welcomed that it was not this type of journalists "not the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate in Ecuador" and, rather than putting forward his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution in order to continue the path and chart the right path".
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts", because in reality "it was destroying the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
Moreover, the President of Ecuador considers as "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgment is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We have to solve them as a whole in order to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that it is "beneficial for Latin America to seize international forums if both countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it is".
Referring to the possibility of his nomination as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to run for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primary, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be resolved through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was I who guaranteed this eventual victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I'll do it too.
"This is my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the Sixth Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed to be HIV positive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful", in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to inquire about him and his hard work was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit at the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, where there were many doubts, few treatment choices and more stigmas.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same", said the head of the HIV unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes as a reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The HIV/AIDS infectious and expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a life-threatening disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depend on the level of assignment of the immune system that patients have at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a rate of 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, it means that for someone who is diagnosed positive at 25 years of age, "as long as they remain under control, they will be able to live without problems up to 75 years of age," explained the scientist interviewed.
In order to put this progress in context, it is important to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans is now 76 years on average.
While mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died as a result of AIDS has increased from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (according to the annual report of UNAIDS), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60% of patients registered on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 died until May of this year; however, we have been assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we've never missed drugs, the problem is that patients are at very advanced stages because they don't know they're infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what it takes to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, for that, we must propose massive screening tests, to all those who ask for it".
The experts and members of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who had to do his test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done so and, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better for me to have fun three times a week," they say, "I don't.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he has cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALICO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
If they do the test, if they take risks, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they need to know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara, who embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all the places dedicated to this, "we actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, it is very good, but the result, that still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers do not want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms not only be sold at the counters, but that they be found in the public toilet dispensers and in the places that young people frequent.
This is not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had said when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is the 4th state of the country in number of new cases and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of the infections occur by sex, 6% by blood and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each case recorded, there are 4 or 5 people who ignore it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a US court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group's debt through commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all domestic companies with ramifications in the neighbouring country and solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country with the starry banner, on the other side of international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves defenceless Mexican companies facing the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow Mexico's main glass manufacturer to bring the case before the US Supreme Court on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the judge pointed out that creditors had to register under the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, sitting in New Orleans, stated that the main proceeding was formal commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, Vitro's subsidiaries' debts to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts had been guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since the votes of the subsidiaries remained, in any way the creditors of Vitro who fought against this in the courts of the United States, i.e. the "vautour" funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 votes to 37.
A data omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, affecting the country's costs.
For the moment, the Gonzalez Sada family society will appeal to the same court of appeal for the vote to take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance claim will claim non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, noting that this would release it from the agreements signed by both countries to bring it to the same level as paragraph 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had followed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Two-part carbbling: they run astray Vitro and they run astray the country.
Overall
The complaints of the trade unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, the latter was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The case, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from the trust F/589 of bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
They seat the Dragon Mart
A group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society, gathered in a Caribbean University amphitheatre on the weekend, and approved the creation of a broad opposition front to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government put forward a requirement of the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known under its English acronym of ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was a good thing that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was considered an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
With the aim of paying long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the real estate developer Homex has embarked on the market of the Stock Exchange for 500 million pesos.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "Battleball is my whole life"
The globe-trottor of basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, player of the national basketball team, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several hats in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," recalls Reyes during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
Basketball is my whole life.
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that recall his extraordinary itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loves most are those who remind him of his time as a player in the Vaqueros team in the mid 1950s until 1982, after having spent 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to compete in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
That's a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired from the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me: "I have a big player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want to?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win one championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gaussus, but only remotely since in 1988 he was already the great manito of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his loads and Mincy's on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and we should have won the bronze medal if this Canadian judge hadn't made us play the last game again," Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, just like the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and we beat the US team, which was quite similar to the bronze team that won the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourrutiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan Am Games of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as has Piculín.
And that doesn't take into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious period of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce's boys play only in their area and only face teams from other parts of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and referees.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch clips of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, attend basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), made himself known worldwide by John Ross Ewing's leading role, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, fearsome and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of avarice in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday night of the complications of a cancer, according to a statement from the family sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who was interpreting his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when he died in a hospital in Dallas, said her press officer, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Doctors had diagnosed Larry Hagman with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and had acknowledged that he had been drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was detected with a malignant tumour in the liver and was transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary type in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In her, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and took her home.
He also played in two comedies that remained on the air for a short time, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his roles in the cinema are roles well received by the critic in "The band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously detestable J.R. that Larry Hagman enjoyed his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their loved ones was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?", invented to maintain suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable but charismaticly smiling man: a dishonest entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who was trying to get his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) interned.
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "Ci-gît l'honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a man " immense, both on the small screen and in life".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the channel TNT.
The recording of five episodes is already over for the second season and a sixth is under way, the channel informed.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have reported on how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she was born in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of the New York theatres in the early 1950s, then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he entitled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': J.R.'s memoirs)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I give them confidence again, I come with them when they come to get surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to give them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a while, but it's gonna be okay."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religious teacher Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook there: the end of the "big count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the imminent end of the world.
But Professor Charmé had no idea what was waiting for him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax abyss that some have nicknamed "the Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of late times thought the apocalypse would trigger.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charmé told his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And you have to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to give classes on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, assistant professor Barry Vacker delivers the course "Media, culture and the end of the world".
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the imminent "desaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave students of any choice but to work "until the very night of the end of the supposed world," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restall about his 35-student course for high-level students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves," says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have viewed all the apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course teaching this subject," he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a teacher, told us that we believe in the end date of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie Zegle, a senior student at Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Maya have never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I concede that there is an anxiety related to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has led to an increase in these speculations.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about that," he says.
This is mostly the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, responded quickly when asked if he knew that we were teaching here on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines does not participate at the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years, we have talked about the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will begin immediately to think about the next date" or to philosopherize the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a 7-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they were thinking of going to "end-of-the-world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at them together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
