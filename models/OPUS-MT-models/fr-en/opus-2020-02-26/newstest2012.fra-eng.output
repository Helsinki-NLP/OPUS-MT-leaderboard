Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
As part of an amendment to the criminal law, the Ukrainian parliament refused the proposed annulment of the paragraph relating to the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
On second reading, MEPs rejected the proposed amendment to reduce the penalties for economic offences, which could have opened the doors of freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years in prison for having concluded a priori disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must rule on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko described the regime's ruling as political revenge and caused a process of suspicion of partiality in the court also to the west.
The plan to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Prime Minister was sentenced, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion has already been defeated.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the victors in the elections are Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the customary law of the Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a robbery you cut your hand.
Women can forget emancipation, any disrespect for faith is punishable by capital punishment...
It is the Qur'an that will unite in place of the dictator's personality the society composed of opposing tribes.
In Libya such an order will prevail as we cannot represent it and as we would surely not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not benefit Libyans.
It is particularly surprising that Islamist warriors have accepted aid with gratitude from unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who directed the NATO strikes, but rather Allah whose greatness they celebrated with every attack.
When it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not part of it.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam and our hairy turned away from the dictator as a political ally without it bringing any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
There is therefore no problem for the premises to get rid of the "crosses".
Will oil companies have easy access to Libyan black gold without occupation of the land.
Perhaps not so much and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of the human rights concerned.
As long as we prevent these followers of the sharia.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in investors' sights.
A tornado of statistics came on Tuesday on Europe.
Each of the states has published GDP-related information for the 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all the records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their economic development visions for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is forecast to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany placed itself better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (there was talk of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
But GDP has stagnated and, according to the Czech Bureau of Statistics, it is confirmed that progress is being made towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0,5% according to planned data and recalculated periodically.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which was what analysts had forecast.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
10-year bond yield is 28.45%
The yields of Spain and Italy's bonds are climbing to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
Yields on Czech bonds remain below 4% while the situation in the region is getting worse.
There are voices in Germany that the ECB should be the last instance guarantee .
The Czechs qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The performance of football has succeeded in its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to the super Cech and goaltender Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also been very fortunate in defending its qualification in the second part and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No particular excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the super Cech and the hero Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrains were under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defence.
The victors of the match were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances of scoring a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes we played a warrior football.
The two teams were unable to mount combinations and the game concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even in the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield
A few hundred college students created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from Ispahan universities created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology centre in Ispahan where uranium is transformed.
They openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclear program at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has noted in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There is a report in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished for the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the Natanz site where uranium is enriched.
The diet of an obese child: does not eat breakfast and takes charcuterie for dinner
Over a third of children aged 9-13 have overweight problems, 9% of schoolchildren have a weight above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This again shows how important the environment in which the human being and the models around him are is.
On the tables of obese children, for example, 50% of the meat is found more frequently than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had fries at dinner according to the survey conducted with an awareness campaign "Obeity is no coincidence"
In the families of the big ones sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted during the last school year and involved 900 students from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of "Obesity is no coincidence", an action supported by General Health Insurance and Unilever society.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students from sixth to third have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors that causes a dramatic increase in the number of overweight or even obese children is the absence of a proper diet and not enough physical exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned say for example eat 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch - snack- dinner, which is a basic principle of a good diet", says one of the results of the survey.
Without breakfast and charcuterie at dinner
Specialists draw attention to the fact that to have a healthy development it takes some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the student families eat at the same time.
In most families each has their own breakfast.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that a tenth of the population does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in families of obese children, unhealthy fries are more often consumed.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sport regularly but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Prepare your diet
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet based on their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating".
Among their favorite dishes are many cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is in particular a great preference for sweet lemonades", is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Towards health
The survey also showed that children are prepared to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a review of a group of survey participants who had completed the questionnaire after the awareness session "Obesity is not a coincidence", a determined willingness to move towards a healthy diet was established," the results of the survey indicate.
For example, the most notable was for sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked on the questionnaire white meat and fish as main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and knedliky (Czech speciality of bread flour or potato pellets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what would happen afterwards.
Presentations by three professionals in the specialty, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we approach the final exams, the more we expect practical exercises and information.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really full.
This time we have with director Alenka (in course there is no boy) treated the way to dress the woman who does not have standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, without a particular curve, another of the overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically ameliorate wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
We managed to emphasize the character nicely and also not to dress too visually women types like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and pronounced hips and a fine waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between waist and hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth it to be made to measure.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a tailor-made skirt you will feel much better than in the one that constantly slides, wraps and doesn't hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker-style clothing, with pieces of sewn fabrics, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of various appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that with regard to what I have to do at home there's too much.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We must take into consideration the current appearance, the type of fashion of the personality and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, which maybe you know from the Victoria Secret campaign.
Deep down, it makes me happy, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who has taken almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut and sew from magazines or search on the internet, print and work graphics.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Reflecting also on the graphic part of the styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses the physics but creates for example the productive pages in the magazines (on products given the trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, a designer and graphic designer, spoke to us about this.
But this... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests of the specialty gave a diverse aspect to the Saturday session filled with information on the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renc.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one piece of clothing in a different way.
Variability is for this prime example.
Like for example this trench-coat that should be worn in a classic way with jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body, with scarfs and take it in picture like a dress.
Or just pull up the sleeves or collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with that," he stressed.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly".
"You can then start to contradict it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, what to do with, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statements on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to the fashion photographer Ben that the designer must have many more variants of clothing than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I have to be ready to "cut" at least fifteen.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We must count with that in creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just watch Madonna who is not a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services is still tiring.
And the well-known faces sometimes consider them useless (it's enough that I know something but what I look like goes to second place).
And if someone gets a styling on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates to us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we only have to navigate on google and make sure that the boulevard information mentions the celebrity in question, whether it has lost weight or fattened etc...
Honza and Mario put us on Sunday's heart that it's not enough for the stylist to orient himself in fashion and know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flattering oneself, keeping your opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, my God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he you'll advise with what to wear," Mario says.
This one has shown us concretely what everything must contain what is called the "placovka" or stylist's bag.
It's the one you hang around the waist and have on yourself for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things like scissors, depilation rollers or nanny pins, nylon thread (which the stylist uses to photograph products such as bags or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of agrafe are not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
So that we not only be people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly resemel shoes.
And during the photo session in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We didn't have the right to touch the scissors so we wouldn't inadvertently hurt each other.
So we really need skills.
Mario made me happy when he congratulated me on my creation.
The account I'm reporting is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of class
I'm starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed Run is fighting all over America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race is transformed because of a set of stupid mistakes of people who have nothing to do with it in a routine morning shift to work.
It fulfils everyone's ambition to some extent, but it is of no use if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled game The Run produced great expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the already old Need for Speed racing series and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how the added passages will be when the main hero comes out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already the case in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole shoots down because of some useless mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of incomprehensible lazyness on the part of developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You're caught up in the adventure of which the main hero Jack has character problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races across America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than 50 races.
The result is that each race takes place on another route and the planned stages in different environments that distinguish themselves quite well from each other and are interesting.
The player does not have the feeling for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are of quite nice increase even if the graphic technical level is of the same type as the previous series.
I mean, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition to times enhanced by an unusual element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche does not fall on you.
Next to this, the different races are well arranged behind each other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
Moments ago you try to surpass the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you run against the watch (classic fuel with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and who are trying to make the situation upside down.
The novelty is the out-of-vehicle passages.
Rather, it's an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away in front of someone and you have to help him by typing on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is this because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model is in the tradition of previous games.
Which means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said that it is negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to look elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the competition the driving model goes very well with the type of design of the races.
So everything's okay.
The problems begin to appear after a while.
The difference between the driving model and the collisions is not yet complete.
We do not expect this game to be complicated deformation and collisions, but when you do not have any idea of how your car behaves during a collision with any object, it is not completely good.
During tight exceedances you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy voltiges.
Or it's crumbled.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really irritates you.
The restart is done so that when you broke the figure or you went out in the decor the game brings you back to the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game again from the beginning.
So it's more a tool, in case something doesn't happen properly, than something you can really rely on.
Sometimes the restarts do not help and the solution must be found by remembering the piece of route in question.
The big hit of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are some turns that need to be passed in a certain way, otherwise it doesn't pass.
Otherwise you meet on a given location "civilian" vehicles always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or one minute late.
What makes you angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you either have to stand aside and convert them or brake them.
It's equal if you go to meet him because it's "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time in the game, you, you arrive in some places, again without worrying about time, and you still have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This gets the most angry at the end of the game when you're riding on a long bridge in the opposite direction.
The adversary must at all costs pass before you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the sight of other vehicles in the opposite direction and you collide many times.
One can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adrenaline, but it is clear that you get bored quickly.
And that's too bad because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that's going on.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of races is such that there's no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change the car during the races.
You have to pay attention to the petrol pumps on the routes because you can change car there however most of the time the one you have enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cylinders for straight highways and super sports cars with exotic auras on very technical pipes for example on yaw roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are races in particular places that you know of adventure, goes very well with the main diet of history.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects start unlocking:
It connects on-line with the Autolog function which inter alia compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult blows to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the subway tunnel (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km/hour (a priori) and behind you comes a metro train which sends you the car directly to scrap metal.
At the editorial board we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought out when creating this game or whether the authors really think we're idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is usually pleasant and in some cases really great.
What's bothering is that in more extreme situations, imaging doesn't hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This mainly concerns accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful for you.
The sound part is good and the track is of choice.
In order to please as many as possible and especially the young audience a new soundtrack was created in the style "I mix everything", but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression of not being finished.
The fun is really good but prepare for the mistakes to hit you in the eyes with the strength of an airfield reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
Czechs behave like negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"It will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role", that is how Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations in such a comprehensible and visible way, to the point that a large number of lecturers from the Faculty of Law at Charles University could envy her, she showed how seriously she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe".
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticisms that he is bland, that he is a round-the-cook, that he cannot replace any mission and I must say that he has cut off everyone's breath because he holds his role to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe".
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?", therefore as an important step towards uniqueness and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-à-vis states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very loud)
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that has lived, lives and will live in the European Council in a near time.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czechs have resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or have organized an Eastern Partnership Summit.
It described the fall of the government as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of Mrs L'Ambassador, "the activity has beaten its fullness" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis which continues to be resolved now.
We must also approve the Union's new septimal budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it would appear that the budget will be thin and with a view to savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be assisted the most, the least, everything is to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that in Brussels no one makes round or twisted pickles, bananas differently large or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky."
It wants to make better use of the EU's environment and to see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to Ambassador Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault, in her view, results from several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Pole, the Magyar, the Slovak come to me, this Frenchman says to me: 'Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing?" and he is not at all happy."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future it is tough new rules on budgetary policy that are waiting for the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the Institute for Enhanced Cooperation".
In the first place it was said that cooperation between countries that want it and those that do not want it remain in their corner."
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," Ms Vicenova expects.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues with an impact on the EU should be discussed among all EU members and not just the members of the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest would be "the long term".
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a company felt very current and however since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the firm's first chief, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He left the slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE"!" has become the imprint around which the life of a future giant will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
This was the basis of the company's culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years thanks to the fact that it still remains faithful to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This has allowed us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more" the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano has delaid for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the thirties, began to take care of his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only among the first American employees to have paid vacations, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and merchants.
In the same way IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
The company was at first great in the discovery of talent- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus had the choice.
The current plan is completely in the spirit of the anti-discrimination strategy since it will be a woman- Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for 30 years and is currently Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM in recent years has been doing what is called jamy, brain-storming online from which many future strategies and innovations have emerged.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are almost 500,000 people who work.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that assures it a secure position in the business field.
"Since the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a tech firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world using its technology," said Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Grande Bleue", as she is familiarly called in the United States in view of her slogan - in a hundred years she grew up to become one of the world's largest companies.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardware, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
She has many patents from all US technology firms and five of her employees have been awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries are, for example, the ticket distributor, the payment card, the financial swap, the bar code or the diskette.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time in 1996 it left Microsoft.
Preview in advance
Not all innovations and manufactures have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM for example did not succeed in betting on a own OS/2 operating system, the Online Prodigy service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"From the moment your business is built on the movement in advance you cannot emotionally stay hooked on the past," said Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they do not work it leaves.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft dealer who at the base stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 it was with more of the participation motie the strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, and over this period it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of promising technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it surpassed the new financial crisis .
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its volume of investments.
Now it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis without being worried?
The price of the IBM share increased from 2008 as a 120 percent rocket, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
For this, we can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to the flights in the cosmos.
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago; it originally had the complicated name of Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially it was a brand used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers", the pendulums that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 chaired the Supervisory Board of the company.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm Thomas J. Watson to help him run the company.
The leader then shaded the firm's founder - Watson's ideas have been the basis of society's identity and culture to date.
Watson was head of the Kusqu's firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machines for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
In the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to $9 million and began to expand to all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that after 40 years of management it was his son who occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM's people and computers helped NASA guide the flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
In 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM System/360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased the consulting company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with advice and services with high added value.
The strategy that has been successful at IBM over the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet".
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and urban management.
As far as the business area is concerned, IBM recently developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform that helps businessmen to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history on our territory as well.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 when it was the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM RT, there is also the strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the research and development team at the global level that is responsible for the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep this donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became a bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
Only she couldn't wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," Rychtarova explained.
When Darina Rychtarova took refuge in her house in the summer in Bartosova, she had no idea that her couple would not stand.
When Iveta insisted after 30 days to move from Ricany, Pepa did not push the singer away.
And he confessed in public that he loved her.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova split up there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He's my son's biological father and if he wants to finish his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my loved and lost old donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," Rychtarova let him filter out showing that she has separated herself from her husband but that they remain only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed the door to him is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and don't change."
"My wife set up a paper marriage and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, the garden, the real estate, I buy".
"With Darina we discuss in a completely normal way but we don't sleep together," Rychtar said for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love he won't stop him.
"We don't sleep together and I'm not interested in knowing where she's going, who she is and if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take on myself all responsibility," concluded Joseph.
The worst vices of women: Does this concern you too?
If you ask men to determine typical vices of women, all of them, both of them, are able to get them out of their sleeve.
Dear ladies, you will know in the following lines female vices that manage to pump the blood from the veins of men.
Procurement
Does your half make any remarks that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one garment a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of sale?
In your case we can talk about shopping as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, who would resist the window lick of clothing stores, to look for for yourself nice clothes and then try them all in the cabin (the ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse that he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I would need to lose at least 5 kilos - should I start sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of anything?
Yes?
So you are one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question you should stop caring for yourself but a large number of men are allergic to the fact that their partner is always complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints increase and the more poisonous women become.
Odre and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite ride.
Wash windows, vacuum, clean floors, dust, strip the bathroom - and this twice a week.
You make remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they dirty the washbasin, cracked the window of the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you are suffering from this obsession, try to remember that there is nothing to exaggerate and that order and cleanliness must not be in the first place in the family.
However, this harmless desire for cleanliness can ruin your relationship and even family peace.
The work of sape
"Put that worn oversuit in the trash."
"Are you going to put on those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you do this work on your partner this way several times a day, you will really break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think wrong you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have to do so much sap work...
Defamation, Persiflage
Defamation, persifting, and insults against someone are also the own of some women.
Women are particularly drawn to relationships and thus are happy to treat subjects as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us is letting a little harmless persiflage escape here and there.
The hand on the heart, however, is a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persift, even despise others and are particularly dangerous for their entourage - especially at work in a women's collective.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in Philadelphia's victory
Hokeyist striker Jagr took part twice in Philadelphia's victory during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again in the lead of the productive Czech players for the contest.
From the point of view of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who again made an extra pass and was named the best player in the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the game told the overseas journalists that he had warned Giroux that it would be a big night.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," explained Jagr after his action Giroux scored a goal from the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later there was a second attack by the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the palet and presented him to goaler Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a run, but the beginning of the second game belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean to say he's the best player in the league but he's really one of the top three," said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at the NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal from Tuom Ruutu and again from Dwyer on a penalty shot she finished with a difference from a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out other complications that ended up two to one.
"Pronger has carried out excellent attacks in our area."
"He typed on the blade, I got speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and I got there," says the last goal of the game from his Voracek point of view.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech Montreal defender Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo and he went out in the second third due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Candians did not stand up to an experienced defender their two-goal lead and lost after a penalty shot by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the rear line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost points because they played the game only with 5 defenders.
"It sucks."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," says Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement did not suffice and we could not resist".
"We just had to simplify the game, push the pallet out of our area."
For this we had limits," added one of the defenders P.K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defenceman, took part in the 30th Winnipeg attack and victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at that time offered trips mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when it was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination for the West and travel to Yugoslavia was very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovakians) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
In the event that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
Travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however it was necessary to line up all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency deal that was the condition for traveling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency, however, was not tradable and it was not possible to obtain financial means without the agreement of currencies (Western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and chalets that the Czechs bought and this habit lasts until now.
The Czechs' travels have since experienced a great revolution.
Although vacations in East Germany and Bulgaria were at most until 1989, the Czechs spent 4 million days abroad in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in neighbouring countries of the West has led to a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not for a long time travel by plane to the west which everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example in Paris travel organizations made Czechs sleep in tents in parks because our income did not allow us to pay the hotel or a boarding house.
The typical feature of a Czech trip at that time was to take with you its own preserved food, sausage, etc... to save.
Another important moment was the interchangeability of the Czech crown which allowed our tourists finally after decades to be able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living as well as the average wage increased, which caused another important moment around 1997.
As a result of increasing demand for travel travel travel agencies have begun since 1997 to prepare tours with air charter routes that through contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s of the last century the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world except the EU which later facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, was prepared from the Czech Republic.
Since this year, as every year, direct air charters take Czech tourists to distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolutionary development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008 the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to rank completely in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time ever in history spent more than 15 000 kronor per person on holidays abroad including ancillary charges. Crowns per person.
The General Assembly must find its President, but this may end in a situation without a "one-foot" solution.
Nearly 5 months already Czech football is without President and it is likely that Ivan Hasek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association will not be known yet after a General Assembly to be held on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement as to which voting rules should be adopted.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek football has gone back towards differences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely apparent on 16 September when a new president was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily in the National House in Prague because negotiations remained blocked and there was not even a question of how to elect.
There was no agreement as to who has the right to vote in the General Assembly — only, it seems, statutory representatives or also officials with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since then with the assistance of the Office for State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
Differences continue with regard to the election rules.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, did not contribute to the situation either.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the issue remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of contention is either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," noted one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Republic Football Association Dusan Svoboda, which represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the planned model wins in the third round the candidate who has received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is prepared according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who has received the highest percentage of votes from both chambers will win.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would lead to the loss of the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely reject the bicameral concept," admits Svoboda, who understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to which it would be best not to change the rules and vote according to the current statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees even though he believes that the election rules established according to the statutes benefit the most Pelta among all candidates.
"I hope that the maximum vote will be cast according to the statutes of the association".
"So that there are not yet any saugrenous ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said Victoria Plzen's owner, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations has defined himself especially against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate together and constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification today at the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"The football will again be on a wave of happiness and there is more training for cooperation," adds the officer of Jablonec who among the three has the greatest experience in the management of both professional and regional football.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement but unfortunately the situation is very tense".
"This is not a problem between Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change drawing regulations."
"This can again cause a blockage in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that the good reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some meetings should take place directly in Montenegro but which can tell if the entire football leadership will be complete for the game.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of retaliation.
In the end, the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parties in the country's strongest sports association and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there is a lot: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik is going to fight for the President's position because he sees no suitable candidate.
Had Plzen Tomas Paclik's leader of footballers seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for for a new president of the Czech Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl in order to try to prevent Pelta from reaching the head of the AFRT, which would a priori be preferred for this election.
Paclik also points out that in the event that he wins the elections he would hold this position as President only until 2013 the year planned for a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager but not linked to the world of football.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he says.
"For me it was terrible when some people told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that image," he added.
It is said that Paclik's main problem is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of counter-reputation who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates' General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to take this position as President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, that would be even less favorable to football," declared Paclik.
What still shockes him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago during listening in an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta managed without any pain.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes President, I sell Plzen's club".
In the event that Paclik triumphed on Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly in September, who had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of representation."
"But as a manager of the Association he wouldn't be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," said Paclik, who in September drew great attention when he pronounced for the annulment of the Board of Arbitrators with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he would be at the level to lead the Association.
He takes as an example his ability to run private firms and has also led the Plzen club since last year, which celebrated with his support last May his triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture."
"I would curb the influence of some interested groups, for example, who tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeals Commission, which leads to bad taste situations," added Paclik, who does not dispel his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose lobbying power in high-level policies would allow more money for sport to be taxed on games.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should take care of."
"If this is the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with Plzen's club as something negative even though he himself claims that the AFRT president should be "over the parties".
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla from Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from Plzen's club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later," said Paclik.
Pelta has promised new statutes for the AFRT which should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, the AFRT will have new statutes that should put an end in the future to the quarrels about the rules for the elections.
The Jablonec official is very optimistic before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk and believes that the success of the football representation today should calm this war period before the vote.
Pelta before the September election, which did not happen, promised to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he was elected.
He has decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the General Assembly last, and this two-month delay may well enable him to defend his vision of the leadership of football and to present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a President on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily linked to the Jablonec club, has worked for many years at the Sparta and the Executive Committee of the Union.
That's also why he has enough experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly, the statutes were approved which were not perfect as all saw".
"If there were not all these different interpretations we would have already had a President since September," Pelta says.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that took the delegates' attention.
"If I become President, I take it as my personal mission and am prepared to take all the responsibilities in case it does not work".
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then, it is said, he strives not to confront his adversaries.
He has previously stated that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he recognizes with regard to his legal training and that he knows well that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
Nor has he attacked for a long time Tonas Paclik who, on the contrary, does not stop criticizing Pelta.
"He's been in football for a year and has already had some success."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some people now have doubts about his character," Pelta said to his opponent but remains, he says, faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from competitions from the lowest level to national representation.
It should be a football vitirno.
"And I would also try to finish all the cases that start with the Bohemian business or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said Czech press agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not bring about any change in people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been an understandable nervousness since there was no management.
Although there were catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believed that delegates would not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of discord on how to vote in the third round we will be able to surpass it".
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head", as Pelta optimistically states two days before the day probably determining for his career as a public servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday, it would not please many people," he says.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected he will start working hard.
He wanted systemic changes and made Executive Committee members accountable for the different areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemian affair, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring football more money and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As president I want to take care of football as a whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and successful football for young people."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for TKC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee so that each of the members takes care of a specific area."
"And I will distribute difficult missions so that football faces a big step forward."
"Many people will not be happy because it will be a matter of starting to work hard rather than criticizing others," he added.
He stated, it is said, that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put sticks in my wheels and cast doubts on each of my actions," explaining why he was hesitant.
"Many people still told me I shouldn't give up because they'd give up too."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"Since the last two years there has been a lot of work done and I don't want to let him down."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like someone to stop them," he said with the fear that in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"Behind him are people who made football in such a way that it would only be for those who were chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things but certainly not for supporting some."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to play football for everyone because not only those who have been chosen will everyone be happy with it
And he confirms again that he would only be a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are any who say otherwise, I am ready to do the utmost for Moravia."
"For example, it is time for the second division to be divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the winners of which would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as currently with only three Moravian teams in the division as the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I constantly feel support from the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successes," said Rajchl, who envisages among his future successes to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the law on games.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united was a common fault.
While he said about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footballble would lose his credibility", he believes that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has enough to offer football.
"No one can doubt Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any significant change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his successes," said Rajchl, who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO optical paddling pools, beautiful Budapest pools: Who travels across Europe can experience his blue miracle - and after turning the city or taking a long walk - can let his tired legs rest in soft water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is one item that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Lying on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cupolas, and swam against the Putten marbles that were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If she was pleased with an indoor swimming pool, she noted in her notebook without delay all the details worthy of interest about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and they have been presented in her book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies du Bain).Münich's municipal covered swimming pools, historic bathhouses in the black forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "tours to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Next to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a true fervent bath culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimmers should be content to contemplate blue tiles and accommodate themselves with the stench of bleach while joggers breathe perfume bewitching spruce forests or can listen to the park's joyful birds.
"I once wondered why swimming pools must actually always be so ugly," said the Viennese.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water double strengthens the architecture
Diving in a pool and volatile sauna oils - wellness factor in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awake, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight to the eyes: "Instead of a floor you have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicolored tiles, springboards.
The small image volume "Badefreuden" makes a report worthy of interest of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly makes you want to make a jump in the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
Next to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Szechenyi bath in Budapest, it found nitrate-containing waters in a natural cave in the karst (Croat bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a bath of thermal baths filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény) in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the outdoor heated swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the bath of Zürich you have the whole city in his eyes, you can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor swimming pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaus, while in the background the mountains from the Ötztal rise towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the swimming pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emanate a smell of sulphur, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba comes a strong smell of oil, which is hard to believe, to be found in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline water containing carbon hydrogen which is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her search for the beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor outdoor pool in Czechoslovakia, she found herself in front of a barricaded terrain.
The bath designed by Archtec Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
By looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in yellow-white red, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
It observed a contrary effect in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: Bad Wildbad Thermal Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that come out since its conception in 1844 but also a Moorish room in Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the thermal palace has remained the favourite bath of the pool expert, Iris Meder - and not only because it is native to Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great performance to melt construction styles so different into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, diving in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor issue.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines in detail speculation on raw materials
By Christian Teevs
Is the German bank abandoning its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look for the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the point is clear: According to one study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of respondents even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions stop doing business because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey of the order of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of the Stock Exchanges on global raw materials, pushes prices upwards and that the banks share an complicity to the world famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in line with Deutsche-Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even though big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are doing the same thing.
Speculation on raw materials was initially introduced to protect traders from price fluctuations.
But the majority of experts in the meantime share the view that the bettors have detached themselves from the offers and ask - and profit at the expense of the very poor.
Ackermann responded to the criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "No business is worth putting at stake the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE an international working group is currently examining the accusations of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - with recommendation, usually.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could lead to a reduction in the market for raw materials, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds his Image
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The speculation on rising food prices shows in a particularly draconian way, how much harm to the general interest is caused by today's banks."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be under special obligation today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested in food speculation," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter, for Mr. Ackermann, whether it's about hungry people or whether the Deutsche Bank's reputation is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first glance, but it is clear that the group's CEO wishes to present a perfect image, a few months before leaving his duties.
The Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change what is planned in the Board of Directors.
He could improve his brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And about possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will care about it.
One in two would terminate investments in raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain strong pressure on the Manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organisation's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's customers would also have personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would terminate, following the survey, all investments for which money was injected into commodity speculation.
43 per cent would not recommend such a bank to their relatives, 49 per cent replied that they would consider the termination of their account in order to change their banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for the world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell to ruin.
Now it is again open and is used as an exhibition house.
If we are excited for a modern post-war architecture, for its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bright and bold appearances and its new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the universal exhibition in Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its steel and glass construction, light and suspended.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture until today.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavilion for the following Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His project of pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the southern railway station in Vienna, was transformed, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for so long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has become more and more dilapidated.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name of "21st century house" and will in the future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday night the Belvedere museum opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a lucky blow from any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian Belvedere gallery.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career, among other things in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, she carried out the work of transformation with politicians and the protection of monuments, she obtained public funds and private sponsorship and established the exploitation of them.
Except for contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba whose foundation bears the same name were exhibited there, a café and a bookshop are there, and an office must be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal performer.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded Joseph Olbracht's secession with sensitivity and had won the competition, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had "practically seen every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his travel to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the building was "a gulf of energy," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facades were changed, glass fibre reinforced insulating glass was placed and the roof was replaced by a particular safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a sifted light panel between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - it is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a shade protection against rust red-brown color.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under the close supervision of the authorities responsible for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and inexpensive had to be found, and which also please the office of protection monuments," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to raw soil in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
This would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels", Krischanitz recently said, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience".
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "neighborhood of the central station" with offices and apartments.
And perhaps another lucky blow will happen: the 21st century house could benefit from the reinforcement of another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art centre, and as it says, it is already negotiating with the city in order to obtain a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has developed a critical plan to avoid train accidents in winter.
The number of employees should double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter season-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily "Bild"-Zeitung reported in advance on an internal crisis plan for the group, that investments of around 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow for better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather conditions.
The number of internal and external employees for the snow removal of railway installations and wharves should, among other things, double to 16,000.
The objective is to clear the wharfs from snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 per cent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago the Chief of Station Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting authorization from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has for years had to do something about it, since it has to have the axles of the ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after a break-up of axles took place on an ICE in the central station in Cologne.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties in the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of Deutsche Bank were not already sufficient, the past of this sector giant caught up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute paid in comparison with 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator makes a series of accusations to the big banks that they have encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost enormous value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are pleased to have been able to find a solution on this matter, without the parties starting a court case," said one of Deutsche Bank's interlocutors in New York.
In comparison, the Bank did not acknowledge any fault.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the multi-billion dollar damage.
Comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took other large banks in part and in the summer he appealed to JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the question of mortgage documents, this is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
The credit houses are at the base.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though the events are already a few years old, at present it blows a stormy wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous appeals for redress or for penalties for non-compliance.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for having advantaged in kind in mortgage business worth about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with the FHFA, which consists of several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005-2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that the Frankfurter answer for "substantial losses" but without mentioning a precise sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the guru of finance, invests huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, it has purchased shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until then, the big American investor Warren Buffett constantly explains not to invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term evolution of the companies shows only bad prognosis.
However, he has read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investment in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight's attack in the world of finance.
Therefore the IT IBM activity grants itself the right to now call itself "Mr IBM".
Because Buffett today revealed to the CNBC economic issue, which he has purchased since March IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a major shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, who even during the economic crisis had ensured reasonable profits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been focusing for some time on the lucrative IT services as an operating accountancy centre.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business calculators.
Buffett had so far rather avoided technology companies.
He says he invests only in the companies he understands the business.
But on the contrary Buffett is instead attacking rail fret, lubricant or machine manufacturers.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a range of major groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenary had taken over in the 1960s the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and had made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname of "Omaha's Oracle".
After the announcement of Buffett's investment the IBM shares increased by one percent on the stock exchange.
"Big Blue", also known as IBM, has a total market value of over $220 billion and is one of the most valuable technology companies in the world with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, says Buffett, he doesn't want to participate.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubted the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology", which would be reborn now.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and a small Greek company in the years 2000-2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population are reacting with fear and concern.
For for many German-Turkish the spectre that was thought to have been dead for a long time reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this extremist right-wing context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been mentioned.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been detected reveals proportions that are far from predictable.
"Is it a return to bloody ideology", "This was the title of the publication on the internet of the Turkish daily "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, stresses that one of the authors would have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right quagmire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with reason: it called this weekend for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks earlier that the Turkish community in Berlin and German and Turkish politicians had thought of a 50th anniversary ceremony of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colors that cohabitation had been staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of slapping: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform- "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
The German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not detract from the univocal conditions.
This is the title of the chronicle of Ahmet Külahci.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was perceived in a very critical way on the German-Turkish forums and the latter had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not come much earlier to the German authorities' minds to do research in certain suspect circles of the far right, the authors are astonished.
More than one is ready at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the case continues to be sluggish, there will be nothing left for migrants other than self-defence and armament".
"It'll be the best self-defense."
"Inner peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have explained well.
The picture of the ruins after the fire of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which distrust and distance by acts of violence could lead.
The attacks, however, have heightened the feeling of us in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
Formerly, it was the failure of German policy after the attacks complained of by the Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire of Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech, how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be estimated on the amount of his tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German-Turks has been towards the local rule of law since that date.
In addition to efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
Zürich Lake Scandal Bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and is in the meantime skating from one crisis to another.
It's a German who has to lead now.
That's certainly not what Axel Weber imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, in July he became aware that in 2013 he would hold an almost as spectacular position: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber has publicly rejoiced, praised; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained strength and has made kind comments on future colleagues.
"UBS has passed the Turnaround."
"I welcome the collaboration with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS securities dealer in London had hijacked all of the Bank's security systems and had blazed about 1.7 billion euros.
The head of the board of directors of UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
President of the UBS Board of Directors has since been considered suffering - and all ask: When does Axel Weber finally return?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank as of February 2012.
And he will take over the administration presidency already in May - not in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber it becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and president of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At once he then assumed responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which had just proved once again that it had long earned the title of "the largest scandal bank in Europe".
Indeed, the UBS is on one side huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The Swiss asset manager's image, silent and solid, but also clever, combined it with ambitious objectives: she also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of banking investment.
So UBS managed on the one hand in 2007 with $1.6 billion more money coming from an easy customer base than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank teacher for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken UBS as a model of good bank in front of my students."
"From the present perspective, one wonders: how could I simply have been so wrong?"
He was deeply wrong.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was going wrong with the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which was previously regarded as a high intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, we were told why he was gone.
The division of the bank had blazed with sub-prime documents and had to make a cross over billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and made a cross on it.
For this she did find investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned the eyebrows: a non-transparent Asian state background from Singapore and an Arab state background, which was ignored, to the point that one has never even learned his name.
But it was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it got worse.
The bank was to announce losses amounting to billions again, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland's second best paid board of directors in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in the pre-bankruptcy financial crisis due to its investment errors and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank has bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, the Swiss Confederation has donated six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland has been shaken - because it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to shelter such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of UBS 2007 increased to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," said bank researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster it followed the second.
Already a few months before, the UBS had capitulated because of a tax dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had cheated the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unwarranted profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus UBS more or less published that it had helped tax evasion.
At the same time it has lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal Swiss bank secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus the bank had lost its credibility in the two main business sectors in a few months: banking investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to tax fraud aid.
And, as there was a somewhat calm return, and as we thought, the UBS would get away with it, it followed this unfortunate history of securities dealers: a single securities dealer torches 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And we publish: with risk management in investment banks it still does not seem to work.
"With the case of Adoboli, we have seen that the mastery of risks is too little changed," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure: "the problem of UBS is that it does not have control of the risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which Swiss bankers had long taken up their duties, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: no too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS plant in Zurich goes hand in hand with the solid cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
Already the situation is classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from the central station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are prestigious, the store rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery, like Tiffany's, can be found here between the shops of Swiss traditions as well as those of the Sprüngli Confectionery.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank through the Palace of Swiss Credit to private elitist banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS through a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front of are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day been removed from the market - or betrayed the two large Swiss banks, UBS and Crédit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he finds - especially in the banking investment, where the Anglo-Saxons would also have spread.
The Swiss would have nothing to say.
"And even so, they have long adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
This was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, made high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle of sub-prime like the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," wrote the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS crash".
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If we talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three largest Swiss banks concluded together a huge group.
A bank was set up, which was already too large for small Switzerland - and has been constantly growing.
What has helped is that the two different predecessive banks of the UBS have completed: a rich bank, but in lethargy with as a strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more strongly internationalized.
Suddenly, international investment banks had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS group, and Marcel Ospel, former chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets along very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made a way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have trusted Wuffli until the end.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake at the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the exuberance came before the fall.
The UBS staff clearly remembers the leaders' meetings at which the leader of the Wuffli group always spoke the same slogan: dethroner Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She ordered the League Tables the rankings, which at that time documented the success of the banks.
After all the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In foreign currency and securities transactions it played a very important role.
However, the corporate advisors, who had the responsibility, stressed a weakness: in international transactions of interest, in the banking jargon "Fixed Income", there would be a huge difference from the largest banks.
UBS would have deficiencies in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS launched itself into an adventure, which almost cost him his life.
The bank itself and a management fund created before it in sub-prime investments in the United States have invested in this sector.
It turned into a massive machine that packaged and passed the value documents based on US mortgages - but also retained risks.
Even when other banks have long been trying to get down.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts turned out to be more difficult than we thought.
Positions at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been inflated.
He who runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He has to find a strategy for a bank, for which all suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger, already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, concentration on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank must atrophy vigorously, as clear as it is so far.
Next Thursday bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank separated with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has established himself: he must conduct the business of UBS on a sustainable basis, the Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of play in the mid-1990s.
It cancels 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions Axel Weber has certainly already asked.
He says publicly so far only that he was going to pick up an apartment with his wife in Zurich.
Next year.

Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, fry are considered a "bird problem"° But experts say that these very intelligent animals have not been hunted from cities for a long time.
Some love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. The crows have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents are multiplied because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote against the "bird problem " is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to hunt frets from cities.
Experts from all over Germany deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in cities.
The protectors of nature based the problems of cities also on the exodus of particularly protected fry: the use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
Hunting, development and felling of typical hatching trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 hatching pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest, among which Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative advertisements because of the crow massacre in that region.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdines.
"Normal expulsion, evaporation, is of no use," said the city and landscape planner of Leer, Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests with pressured water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr to Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the great colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
Evincing can only be imagined in exceptional cases, such as hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We find ourselves forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in the cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Conceivable is a combination of evacuating animals to aversive packaging and catchy offers, to allow them to resettle elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens looked for "information panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with them: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Schleswig-Holstein's Ascheberger-Educative Cheminage of Trash, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent fry.
In the meantime, this project has been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion about the criticism of the noise caused by birds: "This is a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to say to each other".
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Frying not only uses working instruments to achieve a treat, but they themselves manufacture their tools as working instruments.
Ethologists from Cambridge University were testing four fry recently, to what extent the intelligence of birds is coming.
In an experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffolding with stones to arrive at a larva.
Without much training, they determinedly recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second trial, the clever crows then had to solve a more rough problem.
In a cylinder placed vertically, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their loot with their beaks.
However, the researchers had put pieces of wire at their disposal.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four fry one succeeds even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal at the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks for a coup remained unsuccessful.
Favourites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and then eliminated Ukraine.
Driven by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal misled Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made perfect, after the 0:0 of the match, his fifth European championship appearance.
The Czechs reached the playoff return game by Montenegro 1:0 (0:0), while the first round (2:0), had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more hot in the 0:0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1:1 (1:0) release against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other shots for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player Zvjezdan Misimovic, with a hand-played 11-metre penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) made twice a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red map (54').
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in Portugal, South Africa.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free shot of 30 meters in advance in the mesh.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his ability to shoot remotely and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2:0.
The Bosnians, who in the first half-hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to attacker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the English championship in Manchester City, initiated a lead ball directed below the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33').
Jiracek pulled a goal for the Czech
Finally the umpire Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36').
On the other side, Stark awarded an 11-metre penalty played by controversial hand after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But, after the break, the European vice-champion of 2004 managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
Thus, the 1976 European champion will go to the EM for a fifth time.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Goalkeeper Petr Cech prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential (9') Tomas Sivok.
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored at the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the already shot down world-class Czech goaltender, again the striker of FC Seoul had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey missed Zagreb's football miracle during this time.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 MS third-party bench, the Croats were able to enjoy their fourth lap in the final of the European championship.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has gained more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
Besides Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund at the 62nd Minute, the legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the EM since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already taken over with a success of 4:0 the first step for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland pushed at a higher speed from the beginning, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy was given the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the defence of Estonia was able to prevent a possible goal of the first striker.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After a unsuccessful defense by goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was at hand and locked the ball on the line for 1:0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
Europe's largest software company, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.

"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," said CEO Bill McDermott to his clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The workforce will grow from about 2,500 to 4,500 employees.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.

Personal mass slaughter
Peter Englund's new book offers depth and generosity. Entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War", it begins with a long list of characters that embraces your heart.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make your mark-up.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic story of Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the fogs of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
Here he wrote an extraordinary book which he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It has some well-known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it could look like." It contains "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women on both sides of the war, from young schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, paramedics and sellers.
Some will become heroes.
Others are prisoners of war, some will lose limbs, go crazy or lose their lives.
Their lives roar here like the candles of a church: while some die, new ones are rekindled.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
It contradicts the idea that the First World War can be summed up only by the terrible war of trenches on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" skillfully describes other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are under hives; one Christmas pass in Egypt under the pyramids; the tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina that stinks of corditeness.
When gunshots sound in the distance, and you are a mother in the house, do you stay or run away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, expectations, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumours."
"Beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nanny in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are most preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most of them deal with deprivation and the ability to cope.
In telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz. "
"Replacement coffee, fake aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
It describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep's fat (and finished with a fake wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 authorized substitute meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 substitute coffees."
Some stories touch on honour and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive towards savagery and says about the war: "You feel that after all, that's what men were meant to do, rather than sitting in a comfortable armchair, a cigarette and a whiskey in your hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbaric behind your impeccated and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is at great risk of dying, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it's more like "a man sentenced to strangled secretly."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is increasingly becoming a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the mass murderer well articulated and ideologically convinced, in well-cut garments, who executes his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; we find as many basic behaviors as heroism.
Peter Englund talks about soldiers who have tried at all costs to catch venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service at the front.
"We find the most grotesque expression in the pus trade due to gonorrhea, which the soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate people apply it to their eyes, which translates into a blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he captures the way in which war has "deployed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, aversion to religion. "
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging war on them.
The best books dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West Nothing New", by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming one I have read in a nonfictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it's like he came out of his book, grabbing with your hands that page with the list of people and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a carefully planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be empty.
The operation remained secret from all but a few senior officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges facing the Police Department.
There could be no repetitions of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's rules and caused a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park from its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the course of the occupations in other cities.
A major exercise was organised on the island of Randall, with a view to the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better training against riots - anti-terrorist measures that involve the rapid movement of a large number of police officers - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park came "at the last minute, " a regular said, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise. "
"The few policemen I know who were called didn't know they would go to Zuccotti Park," the person said anonymously.
"The only ones who know they're going there are at the top of the hierarchy of the Police Department."
The city was able to learn a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On 14 October, policemen wanted to clean up the park but were repulsed by hundreds of protestors informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from all over the neighborhood - dozens of officers who were used to particularly criminal neighbourhoods.
Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, like migrants, so one hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and speakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages from the speakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As community affairs officers entered the park equipped with their light blue windbreaks, many demonstrators simply gathered their things and left.
No tents were hit until 1:45 a.m., which left time for the occupants to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were spotted on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the Police Department, claimed that this measure was taken only for security reasons.
However, according to many journalists, the police reportedly prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which was severely held by the officers.
Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street along the west side of the park were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward through the thick business of the demonstrators, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of leaves filled with clothing, teams from the sanitation department followed, cleaning up everything the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly after.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the centre of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to systematically stop.
About ten people at the camp's epicentre hung together.
Finally, two people chained themselves to trees, Kelly said.
Emergency services were called to cut the locks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3:30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the clean-up process ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "public disorder and rebellion. "
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the Police Department, is the most senior officer at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detective department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not lead operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police officers were patient along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, mostly equipped with shields, were reportedly even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the most vivid actions of the night took place south of the park.
At about 5:00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protestor jumped onto the hood of a police car. Others were seen digging the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood popped up from the crowd.
Finally, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The school aides union sues the city for dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to bring a lawsuit to the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory dismissals. The impact is disproportionate on schools where disadvantaged schoolchildren are accommodated.
Prosecutions are probably the ultimate weapon of the union, 37th District Council, to try to have the dismissals cancelled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents' coordinators and other employees, among the city's least well-paid, lost their jobs on October 7. Trade union leaders compared these dismissals to political revenge for not allowing the city to access a health care fund run by workers' groups, which would have closed the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis Mr. Walcott stated that layoffs were part of the budget closed in June.
One member of the Council replied, stating that the dismissals of school aids were in no way specified in the budget.
The 37th District Council officers stated that they would complete a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that he would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce legal proceedings at the Manhattan State Supreme Court.
Dennis M. Walcott and the Department of Education of the city will be the defendant. The plaintiffs will be represented by eight dismissed workers, all of black colour or of Latin American origin, like most school assistants who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft complaint received by the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most aid due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the southern Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed at Harlem Public School 36, where 68% of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution states that "It is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents that can bring money to fill the budget gap."
The budget for Public School 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year. Funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each enrolment of disadvantaged students.
The union also claims that the directors of high schools may have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "excession" to describe the action, although "excession" more generally describes the move of a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose wages are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parents' coordinators have been dismissed", and "not only because of overtaking".
Mission completed: Congress finds agreement on Libya issue
Finally it seems that the Republicans and Democrats have reached an agreement in the Capitol on the question of the uprising in Libya.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi as well as American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to make a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of Libyans as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartisan support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties, as well as the White House, came into conflict on the formulation of several resolutions aimed at approving or not the military role of the United States in NATO's mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to allow the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a broad bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the funding of US operations in Libya.
The U.S. mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut the grass under his feet.
Congressional indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under the insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people, for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure win the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide the legislators as in June?
Senator and Chair of the Commission Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesman said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of a new project.
In the Capitol, this week the House must vote an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but they have tried.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been submitted to Congress on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurring - the same bill proposed to both the House and the Senate - and others are slight variations from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending. "
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially the new Republicans who want to do their CV - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the House and Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wished to limit the number of terms during which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (Democracy - New York) wished to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among others.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is perpetually proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow the annulment of federal laws if two thirds of the states are opposed to them.
As eager as the members have been to propose amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th.
The pace slowed from the early 1990s when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Massed but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords during his first television interview since the shooting
Ten months after an armed man shot him at close range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democracy - Arizona) appeared on Monday night on a television show, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover rather than return to Congress.
When Gabrielle Giffords appeared on ABC's "20/20" television news, alongside Diane Sawyer, he struggled to form phrases and needed help walking.
The show addressed his difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the text on the debt ceiling.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and wounded thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described his recovery as "difficult".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, 41-year-old Gabrielle Giffords replied "rather well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20/20", broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope".
The special show traced Gabrielle Giffords' recovery since the shooting on January 8.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly during the first weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, shaved head and a large scar on the forehead.
She manages to use only one or two fingers, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while the doctors taught him how to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") to ask to change the menu of his breakfast.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: we see the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?".
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours with the doctors every day, stated that he did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for information for the first time about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison in Missouri and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There have been many deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Dough, hard, hard."
When she recovered, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was beaten."
"So I'd say, " Gabby, you weren't beaten," said Mark Kelly.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna get out of it, get better and come back even stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a Wall Street gala to raise millions of dollars for New York City's homeless veterans.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and Marines around him.
The crowd in suit and tie stood at his feet to acclaim him.
"The military, both men and women, are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also attended by Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of Staff of the United States Armed Forces, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were presented as some sort of orphan," wrote the military senior in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations that have developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some soldiers.
The public is increasingly acting as if it were sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon be leaving for Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of unlucky spirits."
This is a very sensitive issue for military leaders, who do not wish to appear unrecognizable or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the returning troops of the Vietnam War has been much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and travelled to distant lands.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface " said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and came back to work with the government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that a few people who were interviewing him were asking subtle questions as to whether he would be able to cope with the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you approach the subject of service, you are confronted with negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arose, in part, from American indifference to wars.
Victories are rarely welcomed by a country as unfamiliar with the army and which sees little direct benefit from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for World War II," says retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of a soldier's suffering.
Troops are recognized for the number of periods of service endured, the number of friends lost, or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of growing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a major audience will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rapes.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claimed to have been raped by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked him if he could join her in his room for a drink.
"It was an alarm signal," says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has set aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, threw her to the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still in service and others not, will be anxiously awaiting a court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former defence secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
The latter are accused of not stopping the spread of rape within the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, the trial involved 17 plaintiffs at the beginning. The number was 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke claims to be attacking the galloned military, as the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leaders."
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom could be involved in future prosecutions.
Her strategy: instead of bringing all the complainants together in this case - putting all her eggs in the same basket - she will initiate several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defense, led by US lawyer Neil MacBride, tabled a motion to dismiss the case.
The judicial documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by soldiers in service or not for injuries caused in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 decision of the Supreme Court, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by staff on active duty.
"The alleged evil is inherent in the military service of the complainants" indicate the documents.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still do not have the official right to go to combat, this distinction is only written on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only male.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, women's soldiers' teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in reaching out to local women.
As a result of these two wars, 150 female soldiers lost their lives - two thirds in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize itself says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three more trials are ongoing in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veteran Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four main military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on the diagnoses of "personality disorders " attributed to rape victims in order to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December at the Veteran Administration, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with claims for benefits for those who claim to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3.158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated. Indeed, according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report published in March also examines the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20% of the cases recorded in the army were tried - half the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case described their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the military police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell various police officers, doctors and commanders 11 times in detail about her rape.
She underwent a "rape kit" (literally a rape kit), and her attacker's blood - due to a cut on her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was sitting before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality for the perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started yelling after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember saying to my commander, "It wasn't his trial, it was mine."
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, it was referred back to under less than honourable terms, preventing it from receiving any benefit.
Will Lyman and the other complainants move forward or not, it's a long story," says John Turley, professor of law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same advantages and deterrents of responsibility.
"The odds are heavily against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good have the will to fight.
If the trial is not in their favour, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will gather her hundreds of other complainants for other trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue as long as there is no reform," she says.
Or until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy expressing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been caught of murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, it was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, talking with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how can we find them?
Easy... Log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it was not so difficult to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the website's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific precision - the way Merchantians have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right-wing groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of linking them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By coming into contact with these people thanks to Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and her colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young people and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who associate online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all the topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through "I Love", publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research projects whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you could not approach on the street.
"Before, when you were trying to investigate people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You had to go to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others say that the site could offer a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their drunken exploits were far more likely to be alcoholic than students who were discreet about it.
Megan Moreno suggests that students' colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and intervene to eventually help a student whose status would talk too often about alcohol.
"You can't treat a problem if you don't diagnose it," Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, says the Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who in another case would not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses the information of its users.
The site's data team studied the statistics concerning the situation of love and Valentine's Day, the turnout in the mid-term elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (thanks to the information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its treasure of data available to others for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometers away, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, it is quite another thing online.
"I don't think that many users have ever thought about a researcher being able to study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, based on a 2006 study he conducted by observing the Facebook walls of his students.
"As long as they knew, the exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as a technology researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notebook and pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Froid and inhumane": first appearance of Anders Behring Breivik
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first appearance at the trial in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a courtroom filled with 500 people.
"As far as the jurisdiction of the court is concerned, I object to it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, speak to the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Justice Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Some 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking at Breivik in the eyes, others to be sure that he would be placed behind bars.
All participated in the hearing with the aim of seeing the end of the trial.
"I found him cold and inhuman," said a Utoya survivor on the Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally advanced a little after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik, wearing a dark suit and a blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked the journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The 22 July attacks thus seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief and confusion felt by the entire nation.
"I would have preferred him to look like a monster, but that's not the case," said a relative of a victim.
"It would have been much easier."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview at the movies this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in an interview with Steve Jobs recently found and which will be aired this week in the first part of a film in the main markets, is how this creative spirit understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigramist - a man who believed that many company managers suffered from a "disease leading them to think that a great idea does 90% of the job... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds". This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple for about 10 years. He was already working hard on his new NeXT computer company, aiming at popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a full video was found in the director's garage.
This video is the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired at the cinema on Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known to hate in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs seems surprisingly enthusiastic about exposing technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, with the aim of providing a precise answer.
We also discover moments when the perfectionism of Steve Jobs reappears, where he seems eager to hear the questions of Cringely, giving him elbows to make him accelerate and move on to questions or subjects of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs evaluates what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computer science.
It is one thing to read the posthumous evaluations of Steve Jobs' career, but there is something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of grandeur.
It has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explained them and then implemented them immediately.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On how he learned how to run a business:
"In all these years, I have always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because they have to be done.'"
No one knows why, no one is thinking in depth about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to elaborate on his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" evaluated from the nose, then adjusted with a "variation" - it has developed an automated factory that guaranteed the precise calculation of the commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a trick at the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that was used to hack phone networks and phone for free in long distance.
The device has been the subject of many prior writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping the ball of different things half a dozen times and you were screaming in the public phone and it happened to you a minute later on the public phone next door," says Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We both didn't know much, but we were able to invent a little thing that could control big things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs continues by telling a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night, pretending to be Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy are summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices go crazy laughing just before the Pope himself is awakened.
On his love of technology (and the opening of Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, hunting for spare parts to make a frequency meter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and makes a phone call to him.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and how employees are treated."
Steve Jobs later became one of HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories, located in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first desktop computer ever designed."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small cathode tube. I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for that machine.
On the improvisation of innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a head start.
At the beginning of his career, as he moved in to sell some printed circuit boards, a customer asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working for only 30 days of credit, he had to take care of the assembly and delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they were yelling at me pretending that it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to see a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that was incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are running out of breath:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or printer, and then?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [it is these types of people] eventually lead companies and product personnel are excluded from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who cannot imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They ripped the defeat out of victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge part of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to make... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You need to keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by putting them together.
Finally, decisions are made by personal taste. It's about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply turned out to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas diner with opponents of health law as the court meets
On the day the Supreme Court met in camera to discuss the issue of political discord, namely, whether the opposition to President Obama's health law will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the High Court.
The event took place last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned a case brought by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 am is expected next March, and the result will probably be likely to promote the destabilization of the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming at the time the court's decision will be rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will likely be Paul Clement, who served as solicitor general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
Clément's law firm, PLLC Bancroft, was one of two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual Federalist Society dinner, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another promoter was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, which presents a huge financial stake in the outcome of the litigation.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top republican and declared opponent of the health law.
The guest stars at dinner?
This is not new: the two judges were present at the events of the Federalist Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue with Canon 4C's code, which states: "A judge may attend fundraising of legal and other organizations although the judge may not be an intervenor, a guest of honour, or on the program of such an event".
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the case's law firms, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to alarm government ethics activists.
"This ethical violation and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"Judges were drinking and dining and raising gala funds with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fundraising of this event dispels any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard for critics saying that they too easily mix the affairs of the court with the agenda of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was solicitor general of Obama's administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
His critics pressured Kagan to recuse himself from hearing the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record $18 billion order for airline aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, twin-circuit airliners, with the possibility to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated $1 billion market.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives an order contemplating 50 of its products.
However, this is a matter when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches the record $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order from: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts published on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that the airlines in the Middle East will need in the next 20 years 2,520 aircraft with a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed about the most expensive commercial aircraft in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-caulers.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Aerospace Show that the airline is also likely to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total order to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, nicknamed Dreamliners, a model that offers significant fuel savings and passenger conveniences.
The amount of these six aircraft is over $1 billion.
"It's clearly very positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, an analyst at Morningstar.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore have not only the means to pay for these planes, but a rise in the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them as the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is important because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or postpone their orders for aircraft as the price of oil increases, Dihora said.
"They have natural risk coverage," he said.
Emirates' order reinforces Boeing's predominance in the large-carrier aircraft market and helps curb the attempt to encroach on competitor Airbus with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aeronautics show came four months after Airbus announced to postpone the beginnings of the largest version of the A350, which competed directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase its momentum as a result of customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased by 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president clearly beaten in the elections of Michoacán
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped his rival Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governorship.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to become governor of Michoacán in violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was at the head of the race for governorship of this western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the voting process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," reported Luisa Maria Calderon on the radio during an interview on the Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election agents... they seized the ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have stood out only a little from Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's Conservative party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the position of governor, arrived third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the capital of the state, denied any connection with drug traffickers and strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in trafficking in marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet, violence has persisted.
A week before the elections a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally out of fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man we are waiting to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area get out of the sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the Manila-based BASD, said that the two fastest growing economic powers in the world must "do everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone through the International Monetary Fund or through direct bilateral agreements.
He advised the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with an "indifferent eye" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would help avoid a long-term collapse of the world economy.
"We're all in this crisis together."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to some extent but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, there's nothing to stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of Italian borrowing has skyrocketed and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The booming sovereign debt crisis in Europe has led to the fear that the global economy will return to recession, and has prompted the call of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would deliver any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - such as buying the bonds of the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Minister of Trade and Industry, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a dwindling flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It is not a choice, it is an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help rich Europeans as they face their own major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get 1.2 billion Indian people to accept aid to Europe, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day, or even less.
"One day they will find out that the Greeks retire at 50 and go on a holiday in the sun and they will have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, president of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well paid Greek officials in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD forecast for economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 now faces "risks of loss" due to the European threat.
He pointed out that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic reversal and large capital flight.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Defence Reductions
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, put pressure on Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security, triggering a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, including civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon already digests $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but now fears that an additional $600 or more in cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Aconia, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that the Congress' failure to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a significant reduction, applied without discernment, would make most of our ships and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or vessel - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the honourable senators.
"We would also be forced to separate ourselves from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians on unpaid leave in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would shake the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although wartime financing of foreign contingency accounts is not directly affected by sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting personnel would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war".
"The staff managing wages would be reduced, resulting in late payments to war providers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of sequestration on the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline in the United States as an undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," Senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"It is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself came to the highest position of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise at Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter plane, without enough trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that don't have enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in her preliminary remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential adversaries."
"De facto, she invites aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: time to respond to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk assumed in future combat operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could go to the cutet, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Humvee of the Army and the Navy.
Putting an end to the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is an essential step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines indicates how much deception and lies are omnipresent in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman and Internet celebrity Anthony Weiner, came to be an idiot by quickly issuing contradicted denials with irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards was accused of violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extramarital liaison.
And then, none of the people who have lived the story will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton triggered while lying during his second term on his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances where teachers have given the students the answers to the tests in order to make themselves visible on their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deceit do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a game of society similar to, let's say, charades, where the goal is to exclaim: "I have had you", the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data gathered over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
The liars look you in the eye.
They don't stutter, blush, or always agitate.
Not to conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to expose.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, the formation of the question and the response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and always emerge from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detecting deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are skilled at reading others, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, than men say more lies "centered on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - than married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you say if someone's lying?
First of all, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
That's what we call "establishing benchmark data."
This helps to provide a baseline to measure future changes.
Observe your subject's posture, laughter, voice quality.
You need to know if someone normally moves his feet permanently so as not to make unfair accusations when you see him shaking his feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for evidence of verbal and non-verbal deceptive behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
Deceptive people can immobilize the top of the body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet to the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
The interrogators often falsely indicate that the interview is finished just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson skipped using the past while pretending that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
Deceptive individuals can also use a distanced language: "I have not had sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a very difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember correctly... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve the chances for anyone to avoid victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after the threat of late US approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of an oil pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - generating the anger of the unions while soothing the environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to put it back on track.
TransCanada stated Monday night that it will move the proposed pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Capitol of Nebraska.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, states that the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval for an oil pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large sources of groundwater.
"It's a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the policy's involvement in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support.
The 2.735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so, it would have to cross six states.
He is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs associated with the pipeline.
But the Nebraska legislators opposed to this plan are pressuring that a law to force the remoteness of the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's ongoing environmental impact assessment found that the project would have only limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign advisor in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle prosecuted for allegedly causing a young child to vomit with fear
A New York family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, launched in a series of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she vomited for fear.
"Lady Marmalade's tirade scared 18-month-old Geneviève Monk so much that she experienced "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," said her family during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was on November 10 of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife kindergarten teacher, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing for a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said, "Yes" and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle angryly admonished the pregnant woman.
"She told me in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to him, "What you say or think does not interest me."
She became rabid and began to use swears - the word "" and the word "" in a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with the water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself on the mother - who was still holding Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who led her to a car that was waiting for them, says Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so loud that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis stated that he took the case free of charge and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a charity against cancer for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behavior is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, unemployment and informality in Sinaloa increased, foreign investment declined and the economy contracted
2011 is a year to be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-called change, which has generated great expectations with regard to the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in return there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing trillion dollar losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction in economic activity in general by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical drop of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development's report of frost allocations, there was damage to 582 million 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder of 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main crops affected were vegetables, corn and chickpeas.
The fall in economic activity generated, until November, a steady rise in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the state's unemployment rate during the first three quarters of the year there was an accelerated increase, because while from January to March 55 000 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, a rate which represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of the year of 18 000 969 people.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, the rise in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, among which the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by legislation approved in Congress to combat money-laundering, because for people who earn dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work to win them, to invest them and use them in something," he says.
Migration in custody
López Cervantes reported that the rise in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to work abroad in the United States has been reduced, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because when they enter they already have a lot of difficulty finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market worsens by considering the high level of lack of seriousness which predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker to any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for lag for the state are low wages, the entity has the lower wages of the Country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecast.
The average monthly earnings of Sinaloan workers were, until September, 5 000 352 pesos, well below the national average, which is 7 000 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 there was the largest reduction of the Foreign Direct Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June the State FDI reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, representing a decrease of 87.74 per cent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Secretariat for Economic Development of the Government of the State accounts for a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the companies in the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the economic contraction scenario, the Government of the State requested in July at the public congress the approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the aim of reviving the economy, the approval of the state congress was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no debt benefits were observed in any sector of the State economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers' sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government demonstrates a lack of management capacity in the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wishes of the various sectors, here included the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year was really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, it has had to align everyone's effort and especially the already synchronized good progress of this new government team, hopefully next year is much better," he said.
Economic slowness
Loredo López said events like the frosts of the beginning of the year have retained the state economy and restricted its yield and growth.
"The low economic flow is produced by several events, between which the frosts, one of the main effects was a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the trials, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close far below the expectations we had," he said.
Redefining vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation Patronale of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa, said that we want to channel the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the State, because it is important that the full potential of Sinaloa's material and human resources be removed," he says.
Much to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better channel the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to achieve good results in different areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programma," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that we have worked a lot and the Government is aware that there is still a lot to do," he says.
Sentenced for 8 kilos of marihuana
One resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 100 days' fine for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the convicted minor smuggler is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for an offence against health, in his variant possession of marihuana intended for sale.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck in which he was carrying a black bag in the vehicle's luggage rack and in the co-pilot's seat a small backpack where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated elements were made available to the Second Judge of the District and the convicted person is still in the Centre for the Execution of Legal Consequences of Crimes.
Debts to contributions to books
The social works contemplating programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished or record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that although construction programmes have so far progressed, they are in a risk situation, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions that exceed 11 million pesos in the three programmes.
He pointed out that in total, the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the State must provide 25 per cent and so far only the Federation and Municipe have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to provide a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have not given us anything, even if since July they had to give us a part of it," he says, "and we, in order not to record any delays, we started the works and we have made a lot of progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipe had to request a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided on that occasion.
"We had already undergone this in the previous sexnnal period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to obtain the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he said.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had asked the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to provide almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they didn't give us anything."
Court validates "the analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies had formulated against the presidential decree which put forward the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it were not gathered.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to achieve the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic has been rejected for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation of radio and television is an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favour of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero has suspended the application of the decree and all the actions envisaged by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also decided to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the minister president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure the measures for the public administration to prepare for it through general standards.
"I also consider that if it does so it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has as its constitutional mandate the direction of the State.
The substitution of analogue signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in recent years and this translates into better exploitation of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
To postpone the change, he argued, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalisation, which implies a decision in the public interest that not only has a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues".
These questions, he stressed, "requires the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the State, includes a group of attributions which the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State".
He recalled that a large number of countries from all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, has invaded in a form the sphere of competence of Congress, because it ensures in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative, he said.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data highlighted by PREP, the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second place of the governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total minutes.
In this sense, the President of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with the federal reform in electoral matters.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not approve either its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for this electoral process could come into force, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication within the time limits provided for by the Law of the State Gazette, with the argument that he had some objections.
On the same 9th November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and characterized as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the state's agent for constitutional reforms, because it does not have the right to "sanction or challenge them".
Interviewed on the possibility of the "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to make the partial and total counting of the votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes do not coincide; there are no minutes of voting and there are no counts in the ballot box file; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all ballot boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged winner of the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal or below a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and/or coalition who presented the second of the candidates indicated.
The total counting of the vote may also be carried out if at the end of the common counting it follows that the difference between the supposed winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party whose candidate came out second, in which case the electoral packages which were subject to the partial counting shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
Its ashes will be spread in the Sierra Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday around the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a misse de requiem.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was that his ashes should be poured out in the Sierra Zapalinamé.
After receiving the tributes alongside the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on the board of an aircraft of the Mexican Air Forces, the closest people attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the vigil chapel of the Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where family and friends visited.
At 5:30 p.m., he was presented with tributes to the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues in the baccalaureate of technology and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was part when he was preparing for the baccalaureate.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and his ashes to be spread in the sierra of Zapalinamé, he always said this to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considers that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared much for his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, for they said that he even had a truck; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as it was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he travelled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honours it was said good-bye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who was led by Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Saltillo Institute of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, alongside the government secretary, José Francisco Blake Mora and six others, all staff members of the service.
The remains of the pilot Bacio Cortés born in Saltillo arrived (incinerated) at 18:05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadeeyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authorities had presented to the media eleven people who had been arrested in the same municipality for offences relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found murdered by fire in various parts of the body and with the coup de grace, in an abandoned property of the town of Cadeeyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at 1.5 km of road from Cadeeyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the gate was wide open.
As they looked inside, approximately three metres away, they located the bodies of three people, which is why they immediately informed the relevant authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; next to him there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
At one meter distance there was the body of another individual with a red and blue jeans T-shirt.
The three were lying on the belly.
According to in situ data, the three people had been murdered in another location, as no in situ casings were found.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by an organized crime group to the other, apart from a few bullet holes in it and in the gate.
11 captured at Cadeeyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadeeyta municipe and who are considered to have a relationship with kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burials.
According to reports, in a first incident on 11 November in the Los Alveros settlement, eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another event that took place on 12 November at 06:00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance trip to Rancho Viejo, Cadeeyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 14:00 hours one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape by seeing the military.
They are attributed clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadeeyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the brink of economic disaster
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has put the whole Eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed Sunday, would meet Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed in his majority by technocrats, even if it is not clear when the new executive will assume his position.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the outcome of his conversations with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "frame is now well drawn," he added.
Monti completed the process to form a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy was fighting a political and financial crisis that pushed the costs of its debt to levels that could not be sustained.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
By stressing the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above the 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employer Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot".
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the government of majority technocrat that Monti forms.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
On Monday, Monti began consultations with political parties, trade unions and employers' groups and youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his meeting tour on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1.9 trillion, would be too much for the current financial defences of Eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spanish is superior to that of Costa Ricans.
Of the 22 footballers called from Spain, ten participated in more than 50 international games.
On the part of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 convoked took part in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, if we compare the 22 convened by the two countries for today's amicale, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly rankings, record a large register of class A inter-selection games, the Habs only has defender Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense year-round activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cups such as the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Football.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have an international experience limited to an area, such as Concacaf, which is considered to be of a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the Spanish Selection's greatest record is that of goaltender Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defense 0-1 in London) equalled the record of former goaltender Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Habs and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, Barcelona's cerebral flying, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizareta mentioned above with 126 and the forward center of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Ready for the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the Costa Rican side, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the striker Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five outnumbered the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
Those with less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even reach 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar only has one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not start.
The historical scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz recorded the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that it will also be a dream come true to happen in this country.
It is that bassist and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva of Brazil last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its two-decade celebration tour and Sunday 20 will make its only stopover in Central America.
On that day, the National Stadium will take place from 7:30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles The X group and the Las Robertas Nationals.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent my vacation in Costa Rica only once; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it's exciting for us to carry our music there.
I ask you, because there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying with us for all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to go to this concert.
Some people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows we've been offering over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope that this has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves to surf?
We have a lot of surfers friends and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are amazing there.
My friends were always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the people who love surfing.
When you saw the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to make the best show possible, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to perform two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What does that mean?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't performed for a long time, it helps us to stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of why we loved these songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you celebrate 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we are able to continue to make music together makes us very emotional.
We love each other and we love to create music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go to.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to form part of this group of major groups.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it's much more strange when five or ten groups leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we took part in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're lucky to be still friends with all of them and it's an honour for us to form part of this Seattle sound that arose.
It's also very strange that a group like yours keeps together and with the same members for so much time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only that is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I think we're all lucky to be still alive and, second, we're all concerned about the others.
We are all intimate friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give freedom to everyone to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we don't forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which does not really interest any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and we didn't release a record until Andy's death (Andrew Woods).
There was a lot of frustration for the fact that it lasted so little and most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a picture I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national band Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
It is true that you know his work, especially Eddie Vedder and for that you chose it for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very entertaining.
What do you always change the words of Yello Ledbetter live for?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bassist, what are his influences?
There's so many...
Among the first ones I remember are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I just mentioned, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making the best music that ever.
At first, his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these songs, no doubt, represent this to me.
I also think that you can be happy and even so you can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed for the loss of muscle strength in the piles, told his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a sentence of 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from various conditions, including a language cancer for which he was operated four times and which is under control.
The congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for Channel N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of remission of sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he did not want it because he felt innocent.
He has been operated on four times of tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in his feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving prison sentences since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the Police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an annihilation squadron of the army that operated clandestinely during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica, and made up of various ministers and bosses, will launch a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with the political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "proposal for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", according to the information published by the Presidency of the South American country on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the meeting of the G20 in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's stronger emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to move the implementation of tax exchange agreements out of the "gri list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all international standards of co-operation in tax matters.
Commercially, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (FTA) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The mustachu plumber goes to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario struggled, tirelessly, for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of the bad Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young man in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at the stores of everyone, was designed from the beginning to exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who must say how stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's Spanish specialist press manager Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this medium", as so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second tour" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or only one that affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and "do not succumb to optical illusions".
This incursion of Super Mario into the three dimensions also presupposes the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not happened since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo makes a nod to the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the moustachu plumber has to travel through platforms mined with perils to release to Princess Peach.
Even though I find novelties in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable".
Colom approves the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had given order for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
This concludes the trial for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that requested Portillo to judge him.
At a press conference, Colom claimed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and executive branch, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office he "did not help" in any judicial resolution and he had given way to all the extraditions he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom did involves an executive approach after exhausting all the judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former agent between 2004 and 2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Court of Constitutionality (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved its legal situation in Guatemala and having guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, who was the trial that preceded extradition, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to avoid the marginalization of young people without training
The results of the first 25 years of life of the social support entity Trinijove are important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion received help to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
In addition to this, there is the long centenary of jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock of an act celebrated in a former industrial complex in Fabra i Coats, which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the district of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are not well trained, without work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation, during the election season, showed the unitary character of Trinijove's work.
Next to the president of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former minister of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall and the former deputy mayor to the mayor and current councilman eco-socialist Ricard Goma.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries and the Director General of Charity of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, were also present in the large hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is also, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The president gave Trinijove as an example of how to fight bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-fests, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the residents of number 51 of Rue Balmes were living ended.
Twelve people abandoned the building they illegally occupied at noon yesterday, where they organized micro-feasts that despaired the neighbours, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from happening again.
"From that day on there will be access control," the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially alcohol cans.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass parties, which lasted up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained for Europa Press that as soon as the building was occupied his business dropped an 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property made him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses at three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure space had had to respond to the neighbors' complaints about the noise, while, according to the latter, the problems were not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in the last weeks, according to the irritated neighbours of the area.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the troubles were so great that she even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and it has been nine months since the latter "forgave" the rent.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that the last few weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours for this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had asked last week "for the immediate evacuation of the building in order to end with the problems of common life and civicism that it caused the residents and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but the last few months the squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were also flights.
It is in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be relentless against the anti-social behaviour generated in property".
Yesterday, too, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 3.30 p.m. the police moved to Rue Mont-ral number 35, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects coincide on the advisability of convening beyond the controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens the debate again on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed promotional posters from Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catalan capital being the only one that does not go on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
Collserola's qualification as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed by 16 contests for all access doors to Collserola.
A door goes back to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Collserola: park or mountain?
The competition, both as regards its organisation and as regards the reflection on the city, is a topic of conversation for all the architects of Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected ones talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who came to the meeting, coincide.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of the green blocks was not completed.
"It is necessary to start from the base that the wider park of Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex", the architect gave the verdict for which the title of "gates of Collserola" contains a "lexic trap": one should not think of them "such as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which one must act".
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "some perils".
The perils which derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the '80s and which had in the area of the Forum "his swan song".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step", that is, its exceedance.
"We need to think about new planning and planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (GGP)] can cause genuine disasters."
By sticking more to the question, Modol opine than, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no".
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola that "must not be lost", thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe conduct that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "doubts" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all success," he says) that we had to create: "We architects should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question giving the title of this piece is complex, because from the bases of the contest there is missing a global vision of Collserola: "There have been 16 transversal competitions convened - he says - in the direction of mountain-sea, but there is not a longitudinal reading that leads and understands the area as a whole".
At least in this case, he chose to take part in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors can shock in the program and definition with that of the architect of the nearby door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should guarantee that the band immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its extension, an area of equipment that makes a gentle transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, the legal authority of Casino Red granted the pardon to the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmails
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of the legal power of Casino Red grants him pardon before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the Mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded payment of an economic quartet for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the underground operation of the gambling house.
After the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor, and on 2 September he was arrested and held under provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Patriotic Crimes, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was issued a second detention order after the Public Prosecutor's Office dismissed the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On the 19th of October he was transferred to the penal center of Cadereyta allegedly for having blackmailed the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, an order of capture was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine Jonás' guilt, such as that relating to the collection of 1.5 million pesos of the representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing it to operate.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of the Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor's Office official attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who of the members of the gambling house had been the one who granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to disclose the name.
According to case 197/2011 the legal pardon is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and later no claim can be made regarding the trial against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for the damage nor any punishment.
After the hearing of the lawyer of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15:50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, travelled to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been forgiven legally and his file would be closed.
He will also communicate to him the order of immediate freedom issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the government secretary, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transport (SCT) informed that the results of the accident in which government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven others lost their lives indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it met the requirements for transporting personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impact area did not report the appearance of parts on the ground.
"In a search it was reported that there were no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact occurred structurally.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to carry them.
The soil had a seven- to 30-degree slope.
For the time being, the secretary has assured us that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, managing director of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the Major Presidential State helicopter was operating in speed of cruiser and it happened on a soft rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruising operation at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical norm, the flight was conducted according to the rules of visual flight, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicated adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced towards the boundary area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low-level layers of nebulosity.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the nebulosity conditions the crew sought a lower height area and greater visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has occurred on a straight and lateral trajectory.
The aircraft's residual dispersion model suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under structural integrity conditions.
Traces of fire or explosion have not been detected:
In the area of the disaster there is still no trace in the remnants of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,800,200 feet above the average sea level, and the ground had a slope that has been going down from seven to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that suggests that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search in a wider area than the surrounding area around the accident, dispersal parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the gene of obesity in the case of children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Insurance (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting an investigation to discover the obesity gene in children and youth, called the protocol 'Genetics of Obesity of Children and Adolescents' which will allow to have the markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, Miguel Cruz López, head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Research and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation it is invited to participate the population entitled or not, to present themselves to the participating sports units of the IMSS in Valle de México, where the proofs to minors take place every Saturday from 8:00 a.m.
He pointed out that the protocol started in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Sporting Unit of Nezahualcóyolt (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independence Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and the objective of knowing the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors in Mexican children and youth to prevent the onset of chronic degenerative diseases.
As World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on November 14, he mentioned that the goal is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, to apply the specific questionnaires on nutrition.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and their history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He detailed that, on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, size, circumference of size), blood pressure, determination of glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin, and genetics (i.e., identification of people associated with childhood obesity) will be applied to all participants.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 per cent in obesity and in the case of girls of 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there was also a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others in its genetic history.
He informed that, on average, Mexicans have a 65 percent Indo-American inheritance, a 30 percent European and a five percent African and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to participants is the full assessment of children, which allows us to detect if they have a degree of overweight or obesity.
He even said that the presence of dark-coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicate the probability of suffering from metabolic alterations and even pre-diabetes.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, and the physicians provide it in writing to the parents, who are explained each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain most of the day sitting in front of the TV and use means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, i.e. the highest consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamals - meat pâté with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves -, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analyzed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrants
Rafael Herrera, researcher at UNAM's Faculty of Chemistry, develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture with better yield, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs that the pavement was resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair approximately 200 thousand cassis each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of building and maintaining the oil pavement is adequate, the cassis could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference A technological opinion on blackcurrants, organized within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops modified asphalts with polymers to produce a mixture having characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera felt that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some northern cities, to improve yield, and consequently, the formation of blackcurrants.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, of nearly 180 degrees, behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees C it has a nearly solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on the environmental and temperature conditions, warns the specialist in chemical engineering.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which involved asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and subsequently compacted.
Each of the small stones forming the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles pass there by generating effort, it allows forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, they would spread better, opined chemical engineering.
On the asphalt layer, he said, one puts a last layer called a rolling layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the effort, the rolling layer also requires that it has an adequate thickness and the material made of it must be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because these greatly affect the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil becomes wet, the water pours out inside the layer is difficult for the layer to get out, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes blackcurrants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that gets ruined is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not occur immediately, but it is a process that needs to be treated at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrants and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be linked to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, in order to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrants.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrants easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not obtain the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her title number 14 as princess.
Again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to content herself with being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredits her as the new Princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico climbed with the crown and sceptre, the department already has 14 titles of Princess and Melina one to a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who were found near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation showed she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the Queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "?What was the book that marked you and why? posed by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
This is the answer of the candidate from Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I believe it is a form of culturalization, definitely I believe that the book that marked my childhood is "The Little Prince", it is a rather deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment", it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book that is called "The Ardour of Blood".
This answer did not please first of all because of the term "culturalize" and secondly not to explain in concrete terms how each quoted book marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony it was said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what must happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book."
Between the assumptions made there is the one according to which Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A journalist from Bogota insinuated that being the favorite, the ovationee and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage".
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though at the two parades she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, reporter of the "Como en casa" programme (As at home), of the RCN Canal stated that the fact that Melina was designated Princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who receives most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen".
Moreover, Valle avoided the press at the end, and this was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election, International Juroe Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to her country's social needs.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before starting the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
We also speculate that Valle has sinned by her flaws of her buttocks and the fibrosis that was observed in her abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected her as the candidate 'Natural beauty' with the body healthier, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her fibrosis problem on the abdomen, which in fact for me had not been too well known, left her points on the last day".
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that the error of Valle's candidate was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"Surgeries are good, but Valle couldn't do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of this aspect."
For this prize, which the National Beauty Competition presents for the first time, after the bathing suit parade arose a cruel prediction that came true last night, it was said that this was a small gift that Raymundo made to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as sovereign, if not as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition.
However, she will pass in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A Cali typist passed to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November a typist from the Cali ITC has passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano", by confronting his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists working in the local ITC offices, this week it was the "availability" tour of Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the municipes of Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to arrive at the place where the corpses that had to be identified were located.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after taking appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of friction skin, i.e. palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to take clothes with him for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a Palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who was running the world's oldest guardilla, so he was asked to take the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the dead body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, because it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much thinner.
But prints don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a collector and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to the Minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
Looking for the fingerprint
For a typist from Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Typing is an exact science, without margin of error, which can be crucial in solving crimes.
Apart from identifying the corpses, the typists support the investigation of offences such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of the persons captured.
When captured, many offenders have false IDs or no documents.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The researcher said that in one case of theft he had to remove a part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the entire handprint and identify the offender who had participated in various thefts," he recalls.
The fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently, we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Interluded with the investigation, it was determined that a parent could be a suspect of the crime and indeed a print on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him at the crime scene.
An ITC typist explained that "the fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents are extracted".
When they appear, a collector or tape is used to collect them.
Later, fingerprints are sent to Asif, the database of declines, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians," said the expert of the ITC.
He explained that not everything is how one shows in the CSI television program.
As all that shines is not gold, all that one touches does not necessarily become a print.
However, it can be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignant" defy the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators were scrambling in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large part of the people accessed the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities this Tuesday by trying to enter again, through a judicial order, instead of Manhattan, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another park in the Grande Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators were jostling in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allowed the 'indignant' to camp again in this place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new stops.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said one of the spokespersons of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the 'indignant' response to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by the mayor of New York, Michael Bloomberg, came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order that prohibited the forced evacuation of the site and allowed the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignant' occupied a new park located at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, even though Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, making sure Efe saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenarians of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved as a sign of support to the members of the movement and tried to intervene for them in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private property enclosure - remains closed pending the celebration of a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday during which the legality of the evacuation of this morning is to be analysed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at that time, and they even handed it over to the officers who were monitoring the square, which caused 'some small clashes', Bray said, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The court order prohibits the authorities from evacuating the members of Occupy Wall Street or from applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or from prohibiting demonstrators from returning to the park with tents or other properties that they previously used'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, as a result of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and demonstrators, but warned them that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councillor personally defended the evacuation carried out at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and which was decided because the demonstrators were "in violation of the law".
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it became "a place in which people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases, to harm others", because "some stores had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life".
"The evacuation from this morning to dawn has been repugnant and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of the American workers," added the spokesman of the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression".
The officials of "Occupy Wall Street" also said that they do not think to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with the community organisations and the unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV program of Christmas
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", a first aider in "Baywatch", a rabbit in "Playboy", wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special program of Canadian television Christmas.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will release in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on the next 1 December interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive webcast of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crèche a doll that represents to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently presented a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth", appears come Joseph.
Next to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Noel special program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentina's Luisana Lopilato model in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called American Kim Kardashian 'pute' during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn after the Earthquake
GDP increases 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral of early March
Since March the Japanese economy was paralyzed, recovering again after the devastating earthquake that became a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Tokyo Government have calculated the material losses at $300,000 million, a blow which, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP rose 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and a 6% at annualized rates.
That recorded in the second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
Part of the recovery is due to the resumption of equipment acquisitions to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the decrease in 0.9% of capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increase.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - the infrastructures, to use the deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has awakened mainly thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable increased 1%, driven by increased expenditures on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo recovered to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "refusal values" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in Eurozone and the forecast turmoil of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blamed their weak results between July and September for the yen's contribution.
While markets continue to have their seats in the EU's peripheral countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lose its guard.
"We must follow the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said yesterday the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the points of inflection of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being restrained.
As it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in level 100, dropping eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens feeds doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty resettled in the parks, Greece continues to become entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is imposed rather by the Brussels demands than by a real conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos yesterday reported that there is no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days established in his designation will perhaps be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy Party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," declared Papadimos when he opened yesterday a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to stimulate employment, reform of the civil servants' disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras no's message raises doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more".
The conservative leader has gone one step further in his pulse than EU and IMF, the agencies that need to release the 8,000 million Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to implement the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact caused by the whole of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unlock the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible".
The Spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth instalment" of 8,000 million, even if there is no final date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen emphasises Spain's "preponderant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a prominent place at the global level in the role of Microfinance".
Queen Sofía recalled that in the last two decades the country has become the second donor of the planet with regard to this instrument of cooperation whose "essential" lies in the fact that it is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" in order to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and "very especially in the one that aims to reduce to half the volume of people living on incomes under one dollar a day, to which is set the "poverty threshold".
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all parts of the world, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions from the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "we face many challenges".
The Microcredit Summit is envisaged not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals".
Thus, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there were 175 million poor families who had access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families would come out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and in the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, stressed Queen Sofía as a "act of justice and due recognition".
And she described the father of this instrument as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", the work that she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to know her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those celebrated in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution", explained Her Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought her yesterday the term "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid from the "banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofía finished her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance in the fight against poverty.
"Ethic imperative"
The Minister for External Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to vinculate cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez considered that microcredits presuppose "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty", and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "trust" to the "excluded" people to whom everyone closes the door; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also president of the Christian Democratic Party.
Europe's future was not initially foreseen in the programme but was established in the autumn, in particular in order to satisfy the activists who consider the government's policy too lax vis-à-vis the Greeks today and perhaps the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, put forward by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel was entitled, after their speeches, and then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, did not leave room for doubt.
The master idea of the Chancellor - and of the motion - has one slogan: the answer to the crisis "is no less Europe but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could result in changes to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the fiscal policies of euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give a face to Europe".
This is in any case one of the motion proposals adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank on the basis of the weight of each economy, which obviously meant increasing the weight of Germany.
In an effort to appease the climate within her party, the Chancellor multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in quick difficulty to criticize arrogant Germany.
If the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in a hollow.
By recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does fraud mean when you stop sick?
After the allowances, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick stoppages.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less an indication of an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to concentrate on sick stops.
First of all with a view to budgetary savings: the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of deficiency before taking over a work stoppage.
In short, without a specific company agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, thus at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could cause anger, but which would bring back 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And which would be accompanied by another measure, of a more symbolic scope: to impose on officials a day of non-indemnification in the event of a work stoppage (they have so far no waiting period, compared with three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also revives the topic of fraud, this time targeting the abuse of work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you are taken, you will pay back," Xavier Bertrand told RTL's microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the publicity effects appear somewhat disproportionate with the reality of fraud at work stoppages.
It has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives since 2002, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no more ill than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us focus first on the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million in daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, with EUR 11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% were for maternity and work-related accidents, and 54% were for sick leave, or €6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that hides some discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com career management site, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any day of sick leave.
Another study, this time from Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick leave was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared to their European neighbours, French employees are no more inclined than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud at sick leave represents very little in the face of work in the dark.
Fraud is only small in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that checks are systematic on sick leave for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term stops were "unjustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled stops of more than 45 days, 11% of the 1.2 million cases were "inadequate or unjustified", or 132,000.
In total, 169,000 "unjustified" cases out of several million employees who have had a stoppage of illness.
A figure which is very little in comparison, for example, with the figure of black work.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, who wrote a report on the issue in June, it would amount to €9 to €15 billion in tax loss per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud to them.
Papadémos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to redress its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos said before Parliament on Monday 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his union government would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to recover the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new fiscal adjustment programme," said the head of government, who gave his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Mr Papadémos has planned that the country's public deficit will be reduced "around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after having been 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The Right Refuses New Austerity Measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, gave his support on Monday to the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit itself to further austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with his party's deputies, New Democracy.
It agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his speech was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says a committee of experts.
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the report of the Royal Society of Canada
In the area of palliative care, the committee called for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctors about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the findings of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, with the participation of six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The committee recommends that the government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts quote a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medically or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, reports experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the Criminal Code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also reviewed all countries where such approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization results in abuse of the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on persons who are not competent or consenting.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signator of the report, said yesterday in teleconference, there would be more cases of such excesses in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assistant suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in Support of Euthanasia
It should be noted that 85% of Canadians have already voted in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would allow people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid poll conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not have the effect of sending the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
As for persons who have committed assisted suicide, the respondents estimate that they should not be prosecuted at 41%.
The situation with regard to the maintenance or termination of patient care is less clear, the authors of the report say.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that it be stated in the Criminal Code that withdrawal from care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a refusal of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the committee called for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Committee asks that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations from other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill patients.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Deschamps, who had consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also pointed out that the authors of the report seemed to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values that participated in the social fabric of society.
Now, "in society," he says, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she described as "pro-euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes in particular the report's data on the absence of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, namely in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "complot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
Supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists them and denounces a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "get out of power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's forces were killed again.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, a neighbouring country of Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts undertaken with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is adopting an increasingly hard line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are adopting an increasingly harsh tone" in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces died in the Daraa region of southern Syria, announced the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SODH).
Two other civilians perished "in exchange of fire and shelling heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said the country was "directing towards the end of the crisis".
He also reacted strongly to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow," he added, assuring that "the plot against Syria will fail".
After its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also expressed his support for sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime which, according to him, is locked in the "paranoia".
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is planned tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the exit plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities in dispute and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday judged the decision of the Arab League to be "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to exit the crisis, while refraining from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti takes time to the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and implement a programme, which will contain "sacrifices", in order to recover the credibility lost in the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before meeting with the trade unions and employers today.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting with the President of the Council-designate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said that he expected Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a short list, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented on the nervousness of stock and bond markets yesterday, asking them for time.
In "democracy, there are specific deadlines" to prepare a government and its programme, he stressed, saying, "Some markets will be patient and understand".
Its designation by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern re-established notably after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team with mainly technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "politics".
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative changes, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain the confidence of Parliament by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once in office, to work urgently and with the aim of re-establishing Italy as a protagonist in Europe.
A spokesperson for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its objective of budgetary balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for, among other things, further austerity measures.
The Italian "patrimony of bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see it on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot respect the deficit parameters".
Mr Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism", the "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and a "other Italy", according to editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy is due to place 200 billion euros in state bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, said an American nuclear risk NGO on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from this United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concern" about a "possibly military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko, born in 1934, was reported to have worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk, Ural, and to have been involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to set up a company producing "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then allegedly cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, prior to his return to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear detonation system" "was helped by the work of a foreign expert, who not only knew this technique well, but, as a Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within his home country's military nuclear programme".
Anti-Muslim crimes and crimes increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50% from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined slightly or slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, or 49%, compared with a 13% increase in violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased very slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," the human rights organisation Human rights First said, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organisation added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be considered a serious violation of human rights," said one of the organisation's officials, Paul Legendre.
"The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses," he adds, believing that this could involve an improvement in police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish racially related violence, skin colour, religion, origin and now sexual affiliation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes on Monday in the presentation of its platform, to allow its users to observe the activities of those they follow, which makes its service look a little more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allow you to track the activity of the other "Twittos", the users who follow the messages ("tweets") and those who follow you more legibly.
This allows us to know whether they are tracking messages, whether they subscribe to new accounts, whether they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcasted to the entire network on Monday, told AFP Twitter spokesman Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast someone else's message, #followfriday to recommend following another user) making the insiders happy, thus opens up to a wider audience with a more comparable handling to that of the mainstream Facebook and Google+ networks.
On the network, users were suddenly debating "tweets" on the value of this innovation.
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me to better track some of my Twitter feed," sent @dannykronstrom.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "gold rule" in the constitution
On Tuesday, the government of the great social-democratic-Christian coalition in power in Austria decided to include in the constitution a "golden rule" budget in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid a possible deterioration by the rating agencies of the sovereign note of Austria (triple A).
The Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, while the Austrian public debt is 74.6%, well above the 60% maximum criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece and Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were to be reduced by just one step, from AAA to AA+, we should pay three billion euros in extra interest each year," said Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democrat Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area member countries on 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had then called for the inclusion by the end of 2012 of the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are close to the "German model", with Germany being the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, starting in 2017, the federal government's structural government deficit will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to submit balanced budgets.
The objective is to bring public debt up to the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Yen strong
Noda threatens new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japan's Prime Minister, Yoshihiko Noda, warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was rising not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo sold massively yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new vigour record since 1945 against the green note.
But the yen has since been regularly raised, doped by purchases from investors who consider it a "refugee value" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was returned Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro went down below the 105 yen symbolic bar, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar paid around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is detrimental to the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign earnings by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currencies.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (northeast), said Noda who fears that this increase in the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third largest economic power in the world returned to growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister found that the price of the yen did not reflect "the economic fundamentals of Japan".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion EUR), raising the ceiling for purchases of various financial securities to 55,000 billion yen (519 billion EUR) in order to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
the rates rise, the Stock Exchanges fall
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis still undermines European indices.
Despite the designation of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European Stock Exchanges are sinking a little more into negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 lost 1.4% at 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt sells 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the yields of euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains. "
" Investors, nervous, are only too aware of the risk of contagion, " says Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, in turn suffering renewed fears from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
" Japan, like the rest of the world, has an eye on Europe and trade will continue in a narrowly variable corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation is stabilized, " says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to decline on Tuesday.
The euro has been evolving at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10 a.m., the European currency is worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it has retreated after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, meeting in congresses on Monday, adopted a motion providing, inter alia, for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has demanded time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October would be the "main task" of his government.
Spain is on the market line, while parliamentary elections in the country are held on Sunday.
The spread differential between Germany and Spain's 10-year bonds has reached a new high level.
Pending euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the expected 0.3%, driven by household consumption.
However, INSEE revised the second quarter figure downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned against the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is healthy for an election to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place of nuclear power.
The debate will only be fruitful if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
While we are 7 billion human beings on the planet, demographic change will result in a doubling of the demand for electricity by 2050, unless we deprive a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be overcome in order to continue to produce electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its own to the need to be able to find a replacement source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which just intends to build only new generation plants.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic, Finland, Poland, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to name but a few, are pursuing their projects with determination.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to its fleet by taking over the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
While the German renewable energy model is sometimes presented as an example, the reality contradicts the discourse.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an energy dependence aggravated by the increased use of imported gas, in particular from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already felt.
The case of Denmark is to be meditated.
He is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittentness of the wind, with 30% of his electricity, and 65% and 50% higher than the European average respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than those of French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear power would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make illusory the fine declarations on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of purchasing power.
A price that a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show this.
Let us recall that our country's energy policy has built an industrial sector of 125,000 direct jobs and 410 000 jobs.
Strongly exporting, it brings a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very much creating non-relocable jobs.
If France were to decide to get out of nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the 6 billion euros per year of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to operate sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of miracle electricity generation, nor is there any evil one.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a safety authority that exercises intransigence and transparency over existing power plants as well as on the Flamanville site.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions and remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident is the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that have caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did with the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the French and German safety authorities, operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians wishing to build a power plant, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift offered to the competitors of Areva and EDF by leaving them the clear way to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotions, dogmas and partisan maneuvers dominate such a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy carried out under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the number policy, compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "human rights countries" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has come to light, with the Minister of the Interior (read Libération of 23 May) proclaiming in passing that France "does not need foreign talents, masons and restaurant servers".
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
It is that there is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers", and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France "can't accommodate all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, fear of the invasion of national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be given to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande confines himself to banalities, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be paid for by election; but it is economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book synthesizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants may replace national workers, particularly the low-skilled, with downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mostly engaged in trades in sectors in need of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon will find it difficult to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants mean that immigrants' arrivals have a positive effect on the wages and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri thus calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows leads to an increase in real long-term wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, on average at 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organisation estimates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenues less expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average throughout his life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term of office, to look for the missing growth points "with the teeth".
The teeth in question, by being used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, Europe still has to think about democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember it, which, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the twentieth century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have believed that it would be enough for democracy to definitively triumph over its enemies to exercise the vote and exercise it in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that this was an ease of thought.
Universal suffrage, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not the sufficient condition and can even be made "an instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, education, Enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have had in this respect the value of double revealing: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now moved, and for many of them Republican soldiers no longer shoot in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to necessity and in dispersed order.
A white-seing to the absolute European monarch or a foot jump joined in the vacuum of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutlets, but a common exercise, of course, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - and there is no longer any way to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that lies with the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are worried about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that slowly loses its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgency is to give back to popular sovereignty the management of the European project.
For it is together that Europeans will be able to reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without complete democratic legitimacy, except of course to lead us to disaster.
After a long fight against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone today calls for the European economic government.
All right.
But thinking it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take a new step in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
The Revolution in the interests could not be enough.
This lesson remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic Europe, a genuine European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"No contact" smart cards are becoming more widespread
The world smart card show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 is expected to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, phone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is the contactless technology that allows you to pay for public transport or to pay for your purchases by simply approaching a player's card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold around the world, compared to 320 million a year earlier!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent nearly 10% of the global market for smart card (6,925 million cards).
Long behind in the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put double bites.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
To move faster, banks must now equip their customers.
"Two large French establishments have committed themselves to systematically distributing to their customers in the future bank cards equipped for the contactless," said Gérard Nébouy, Managing Director Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology that is essential for transactions.
"They've fallen behind."
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
"We are counting on the sale of 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees will be equipped with a case allowing the payment without contact.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday that it was preparing to place on the market an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile phone.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long-suspected, the links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram continue.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algiers has now "acquis la certitude".
"The way in which the two organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two Frenchmen in Niger last January is said to have uncovered bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past calls is directed to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect has received external financial and intellectual support and is becoming increasingly active," said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, these "supports" had been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses or in his operating procedures, which now involve the use of more and more complex suicide bombers or explosive devices and on the same basis as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, beginning with Washington, has therefore pressured Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of illumines of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, school and fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haousa means "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic emirate in northern Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is rapidly successful.
It politicizes and demands strict respect for the sharia while its militants engage in the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are aimed primarily at churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, multiplying attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction is, as usual, without nuances.
The army is investing the city. There are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested alive, is killed in prison.
From then on the sect will radicalize and leave its fiefs from the north.
Last Christmas, she claims an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, then another in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the police's secure headquarters during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the UN headquarters will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa that would navigate from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria now worries all security professionals.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, while al-Shebab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat at the heart of the continent.
Last week, during an interview in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready "to share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have multiplied the tone of statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a Republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - sound.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the race for the nomination of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and question them "for manipulation of their currency", a theme that was a source of frustration in an America that was driven by the migration of entire sections of its industry to Asia.
So much if it should involve the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate to have a sophisticated foreign policy vision, almost strangled himself against an attitude that "flavors" emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who stagnates in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he bragging.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texan Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to hire the US army in Mexico against the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he had won the cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine with regard to anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the too hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, thus sticking to him a weak label.
But the attack is not so easy.
The population is quite positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stalemate.
And, arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more justly.
The North Stream, a new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea, has entered service.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event brilliantly.
More than 500 guests including four Heads of State and Government took part on the Baltic coast last Tuesday, between orchestra and fine buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, this new gas pipeline which directly connects Russia with Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte turned together the steering wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe by a first 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region to the Mecklenburg-Pomerania Land.
A second tube is to be completed at the end of 2012, which will deliver a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third one on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction site has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The Nord Stream will be able to deliver gas directly to Germany, avoiding any land crossing by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare the Nord Stream with a "new German-Soviet pact", with reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is to say, the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of Europe's energy, since the project has created a breach between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has been able to overcome its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming and whose deposits are declining.
" This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically, " confirmed François Fillon in opening this gas pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by the leaders of Gazprom, many present in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical feat.
The submarine tube is made of concrete-coated steel to protect it from anchors from ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, 200 m on average.
To build it, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed, as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
There has also been a need to increase measures to protect wildlife.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts over its entire length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but project managers gave up while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company established permanently off their coasts.
" In case of damage, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute, " says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who planned the welds for leakage every 100,000 years.
Monitoring of the state of the pipeline is carried out by an underwater robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by an aircraft operating inside the pipeline.
In the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one metre wide, and it is pushed by gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, it provides precise information on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without having to undergo any repair.
The flow of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
It is 200 bars at departure, and 100 at arrival.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the shares.
The Germans E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each) joined.
These five companies created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transport capacity to the company for 20 renewable years.
" Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported, " says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the pipeline was provided at 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to go back to their costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 metres high, form the gas outlet door.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the gas arriving before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has received a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskin, a bookmark.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, Moleskin wants to restore the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, its elastic, its leaves of an off-white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design notebook but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then consultant for the company, is in charge of the launch of the new product.
The notebook is inspired by an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton used to cover benches, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskine has restored to the taste of the light an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of the avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is there.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskine crossed Italian borders and exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up a sketch of the buyer, because the notebook seduces both the businessman and the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskin, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultivated.
The small Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now has almost 100 employees and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from La Fnac to small shops in the city centre and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the look of time and this new need for writing, despite the rise of emails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies Moleskine's development: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a wide range of supports.
A success that has made envious: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in Moleskin's history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of disabled people opens today.
Despite a proactive public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the population as a whole.
Disturbing?
" No, " says Eric Blanchet, Director General of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
" The progress made over the past fifteen years is considerable. "
" At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher. "
" Nevertheless, there is still a great deal to be done. "
It must be said that for the disabled unemployed, there are still many obstacles before they reach employment.
They are rather old: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% do not have a baccalaureate and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for the disabled, compared with an average of 38%.
In short, all these criteria make it particularly difficult to return to employment, and which are "the core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Springboard, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for the objective brakes.
It remains the unsaid, the evolving mentality, of course, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité association indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability", with "over-representation of persons in wheelchairs, persons with mental or intellectual disabilities".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from meeting the employment target of 6% of disabled workers, set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, dating back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
" We are now around 3%, " says Pierre Blanc, General Manager of the Agefiph, the organization responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (from 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses, " explains Pierre Blanc.
" But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups. "
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Just happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45 pm) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure of this friendly match.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did indeed make peace.
Five months after his attacker's mood gesture against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has only a few praises to make about him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, with his progress and with the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lilleman.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and selection, "it is a whole," he justified himself.
"In Lille, I'm there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Died against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "brilliant".
However, without omitting the notion of "pleasure".
Blues, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a supporter," he says.
This necessarily contributes to further strengthening the "special" character of this meeting.
Especially as opposite, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami), " he recalls.
"We met earlier."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With bonhomie, Leekens spoke of "fierty".
"Fierty" to play "a gala game."
"Fierty" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France has "re-established itself as a very high-level team" a little more than a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he enthused himself.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with Les Bleus in the direction... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he said.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You're going to see it in the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimist its dam back to Bosnia (22h00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
On the way, the two teams lacked realism.
" At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country. "
Paulo Bento is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been in control since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there's a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to undo.
Considering the game go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's hell, it seems obvious that the games are not made.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, of course, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
" It's a good result, but there's some risk because we haven't scored a goal outside. "
But at home, in their luminous Stadium of the Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as boiling, even if the part obviously looks "very tight", dit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
" We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead, " said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
" We continue to have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012 ", still relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The draw reported on Friday in Bosnia obliges the Portuguese to score and win.
A zero can be enough for the Bosniaks, who also need to score.
" This is a good result, but there is some risk because we have not scored a goal outside, " says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "do not give them time to think."
A good idea, if you're realistic this time.
