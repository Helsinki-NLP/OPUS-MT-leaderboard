Inflation in Europe has derailed food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, price increases in the 13 euro area countries were higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent was recorded, the European Community Statistics Office in Luxembourg said.
Official forecasts have indicated only 3 per cent, says Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, British and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the policy interest rate by saying that the decline in interest rates, along with the growth in commodity prices and the fall in the unemployment rate, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so that we do not have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent has been a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has taken off as a result of the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Grain futures market ratings have increased by 88 per cent and soybean prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world price of oil rose by 52 percent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 per cent this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9 per cent.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months, the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the policy rate twice in 2008.
Gallup reports government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of Fidesz (Alliance des jeunes démocrates) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, whereas Gallup (Institute of Polling) has never seen such low socialist support, i.e. 13 per cent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, because of the greater determination of the opposition voters, a support of more than two thirds (71 percent) against the support of one fifth (20 percent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the poll, the MDF (Hungarian Democratic Forum) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two per cent throughout the population.
The number of supporters of both parties has increased by 1 per cent among the faithful voters, some of whom are going to vote.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate from the previous low point, the proportion of those who felt that the country's economic situation was particularly serious has never been so high, it rises to 41 per cent and according to 46 per cent the situation is quite serious.
After the more optimistic outlook of the spring and summer, families are once again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population foresees a worsening and only one tenth foresees an improvement in the situation.
Last December, 71 per cent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job rather badly than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 per cent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 per cent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society thinking that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after the riots last October, 35 per cent of those surveyed wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, this rate currently represents only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
On the question of the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly go to vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably go to vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday", only 55 per cent of respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. According to current intentions, the result of the referendum would be beyond doubt.
74 per cent would say no to higher education fees, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital expenses.
When we look only at the same proportions among those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital living expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by almost twenty percent
The hypermarkets in Budaörs' trade triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 percent last year, but this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (daily economy)
This year, in Budaörs' commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas Basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, a value increase of well over a thousand forints was registered in all hypermarkets.
Prices, which had already "flyed" in the large food stores last December, have not risen sharply compared to the previous high base.
Nevertheless, consumers are obviously shocked to see that items purchased well below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The Daily Basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded by 91 forints, at least, the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints.
And the highest value of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, this value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but prices for turkey fillet, nuts and poppy rose sharply.
In shops, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from one kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the recorded bottle of two litres of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints the bottle recorded therein.
However, this year, in terms of Daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the least expensive.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of her Daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased them by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
By comparing last year's most expensive basket with this year's lowest price basket, we find a 12 percent difference, while the difference between last year's lowest price basket and this year's most expensive basket is 21 percent.
Prices rose by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year prices rose by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the increase in the VAT rate was already apparent in last year's Christmas prices.
This process made trade perplexed, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply to products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he risks losing a big profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in the rate of VAT, the price increase of the daily basket has evolved so excessively that the most expensive basket was 1 720 forints higher than the value of the 2006 basket, whereas the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so great as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the lowest prices also increased by 1,284 forints.
By bringing the two Christmas seasons closer together, we have seen a catastrophic price increase, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer goods have risen by more than 30 per cent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm the KSH data: for some essential foods, the Institute of Statistics has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the latter's Daily Basket, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, rose by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
According to the indices, flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get the sharp rise in prices also accepted by multinationals.
In the commercial gold triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
According to our experiences, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take long-lasting food by pallets.
On Wednesday morning important tails were formed at the caisses of the three hypermarkets because the number of customers increased sharply.
However, according to our information, the turnover is lower in the province, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been registered in hospitals.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, the insufficient number of beds and the overwork of medical personnel do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of János Hospital.
Antibiotic resistant bacteria were detected in a man hospitalized after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person from a serious car accident came out of the hospital but shortly after he had to go back because of an MRSA infection and, since then, the doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-drug resistant pathogen have been reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
To know that it is the number of infections caused by a multidrug resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two-thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSAs, i.e., methicillin-oxacilline-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing a disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics, they are easily cureable.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which reacts well to antibiotics, will develop a well-resistant bacterium that will rapidly proliferate under poor hospital conditions.
In cases of temporary or prolonged malfunction of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly patients with small weights or a weakened body.
According to the medical director of the János hospital, there is nothing special in MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily life of hospitals.
Above all, we must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we can't find MRSA only where we're not looking for them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
SAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, the healthcare staff put on rubber gloves and protective masks and we have antibiotics adapted to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, inpatients are examined if they carry MRSA, however infection cannot always be avoided.
The sampling of the sample is not in the mode
The vast majority of infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances are not favourable in Hungarian hospitals to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-drug resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and in homes for the elderly, hospitals should control inpatients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases occur only if the MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the chief physician of the epidemiologic centre.
The European Union has rigorous recommendations on the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological examinations should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient care and in basic care, Karolina Böröcz said.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSAs proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, wear gloves and protective masks. However, significant deficiencies are also detected in hospitals in this area.
MRSAs proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and by contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, while in terms of epidemics, patients should be at least 1.5 metres away from each other.
Unfortunately, we also see that hospitals, in difficult financial circumstances, save on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is demonstrably lower or the proliferation of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenses for social security funds, which is why we fight this infection everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of AMRs.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) highlights the prevention of the incidence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens (such as MRSAs) and the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, responsible for a fatal accident, was not in a state of drunkenness.
The official statement concerning the fatal accident caused by the Commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement has been drawn up.
It may be excluded that the commissioner of the 22nd arrondissement, who has resigned from his post since then, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of drunkenness or stunned, communicated Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was made.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation, which already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving.
Last Tuesday, the former chief of the 22nd arrondissement police station crushed a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his personal car, in the street Kossuth Lajos of the 22nd arrondissement. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(In fact, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing is not a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car that starts a turn must allow pedestrians to pass.)
The pedestrian died after being transported to the hospital.
As a result of the accident, the Commissioner resigned from his position and applied for his retirement because, according to police communication, he was greatly upset by the accident.
The investigation of this case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
Additional €400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Minister of Finance of Hungary, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of €400 million on a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties. This time, the contract signed concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million agreement also concerns the budgetary financing of education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, and the remaining EUR 150 million can be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a EUR 50 million contract for innovation, the state budget will use this envelope in the first place in the research and development project to be carried out at the University of Debrecen.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the original contract once Hungary finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has provided a total of EUR 8.4 billion for the financing of 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at EURIBOR interest rate, with a grace period of 8 years and without commitment commission.
Bulgaria, paradise of the EU real estate market
The evolution of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on this Balkan country little mentioned in the past.
What, or who bought in this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is undoubtedly the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap seaside houses.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands", the "Côte du soleil", the former Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more people are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik regions as well.
According to the analysts of Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also more and more numerous to buy in the cheap corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, also offers attractive opportunities, the areas of shops and offices promise the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the Bansko area.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time seeking to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we traditionally meet many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
People who intend to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, the proximity of a large city, shops and generally that of the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria is listed among the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group consists of commercial investors who purchase in the hope of achieving a medium or long-term surplus value.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising as demand increases.
In the European Union, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years, they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The increase in real estate prices mainly exceeds the increase in wages.
Fodor and the Hungarian six percent
According to the communication of Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, the meetings of the professionals end Tuesday, yet Wednesday, after the official opening, the negotiations of the ministers on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali road map to define post-Kyoto emission reduction efforts until 2012.
At the moment, there are strong discussions on the subject between developing and developed countries.
The United States also reported that, for the time being, it did not want to discuss exact figures, but was ready to sign an agreement on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels until 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, outside of emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement was also signed on aid to be provided to developing countries.
The aid fund defined by the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably under the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF), Piac és Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Gábor Fodor, Minister of Environment and Water, confirms the EU's ambition to retain its role as flagship in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU was committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from 1990 levels, regardless of the successful signing of the "post-2012 Agreement", and was prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and/or developing countries were also prepared to make commitments tailored to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol countries had targeted a total reduction of 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members of that period made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent from 1985 to 1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The challenge is high in Bali because the long-term international agreement on climate policy must be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be delayed after 2012. In this case, the commitments to reduce below the values set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was stressed in the new report of the International Science-Based IPCC, which won the UN Nobel Peace Prize for dealing with climate change.
The reduction of emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average Earth temperature of more than 2 degrees Celsius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army recruits on YouTube
The British Army units make available, on the video sharing site, recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of making themselves popular.
First, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that became passionate about YouTube: Special Units operating in Afghanistan have been loading video footage of Taliban operations since March 2006, announced the BBC.
These recordings, taken with miniature cameras mounted on the helmet, are controlled at the Air Force Operations headquarters in Kandahar and are then transferred to Londrès or the compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air Force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this route and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered as the Defenceheadquarters in the spring of 2007 and provides videos of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own channels on YouTube.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the initial objective of the air force, the videos were put online to recruit, and according to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to make the public aware of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published in this way costs virtually nothing compared to the usual advertising of recruitment on television, communicated to the BBC Gordon Mackenzie, a defence consultant, but it also inevitably carries a political message as it justifies in a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game
The army is bothered because, apart from the carefully censored and composed videos, amateur videos are passed on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the web showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army only recently got ready to load these videos.
American recruits a little differently by using the free downloadable America's Army shooting game. In this game the player can put himself directly in the place of soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffles and donuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold an end-of-year meeting with her collaborators who will be able to say goodbye to the year 2007 by taking donuts and coffee.
Another ministry will organize a party with live music, another will enchant officials with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertains the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited to attend.
At Christmas, Orphans, the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for the missionary Christmas, the family members of the soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The ministry is planning a budget of 25 million forints to create the end-of-year atmosphere.
Compared with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will feast.
GKM's party will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees in bulk, three hundred and fifty are expected there.
At this party, the atmosphere of Christmas will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
The NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was organized on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (ILO) with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a service of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, company managing the tenders.
The building of the Théâtre de la Gaîté has been rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person in charge.
The costume is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, held a ball on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
There were five hundred people in this ball.
The party began with the minister's welcoming words and the dinner was followed by a dance evening on live music.
Answer to [origo]'s question: Evening dress was not mandatory at all at this ball.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober party.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not invite his employees officially to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected to be invited to have coffee and to eat donuts, communicated the press service, the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his collaborators to have a drink in the aula of the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Planning.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will organize a Christmas party in its large hall, at which 436 employees are expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a drink.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No festive atmosphere is planned, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the holiday time taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will host a reception on 20 January to celebrate the New Year, the Christmas party will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in the town wood, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this is going to be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate at all for Christmas, have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather together
The unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will set up, on Friday, their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating the strike on Monday.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the Health Care Fund Act, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic jams because rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and employees of BKV (common transport company) will also strike until 1 p.m.
The Unions de la Ligue will announce, Friday afternoon, the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The strike committee of LIGA - MOSZ will also be set up and will serve as coordinator of Monday's actions.
On Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, starting on Monday, organizations joining the strike will stop work for an indefinite period of time if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, starting from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the Health Fund Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next steps.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Care Fund Act will take place only late in the evening or at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic jams are foreseen: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of the Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the way will also be blocked.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call to strike, the list of them is constantly updated on the Ligue website.
Some organizations report an indefinite strike, others report a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railway Chemins) and the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ) have failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but as Christmas holidays approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, public transport in Budapest will strike from the beginning of service until 1 p.m., the Budapest airport between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., the Industrial Unions of Electricity and Thermal Energy of the League will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Union of Teachers have called to strike for two hours and from 2 a.m. to 8 a.m. respectively.
The National Association of Physicians will strike across the country in alternation, the Health and Social Workers' Union (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will carry out a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, formulated by the League, demands that the government withdraw its proposal for health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new retirement calculation method to be introduced from next year be introduced in several stages.
The third claim seeks a guarantee, with regard to retirement before the legal age, that would allow the functions that deserve it to be transferred into the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Trade Union of Railways (VDSZSZ), attached to the Unions of the League, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning the secondary railway lines and the waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased risk country
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital (Risk Analysis Division), the activities of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August, with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for a Better Hungary) increase, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning", society points out that, in connection with the work of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur as a result of the growing ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary".
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy to probably provoke this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma case to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which have based a political strategy on the dispute between the Gypsies and Hungarians".
The problem is aggravated, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, as a result of the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the Hungarian Guard's activity "has significantly deteriorated Hungary's image abroad, particularly with regard to confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country".
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganization of the radical and extreme right-wing Hungarian groups since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007 calling themselves the "national self-defence association".
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of order), armed if necessary, moreover, by evoking the incapacity of the police, the army, in other words the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions in a civilian way.
The emphasis on civility and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering these associations in court, but it is also a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk in relation to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries want to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the constitution of the Hungarian Guard.
This influences the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the operation of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The numerous disturbances of Roma who broke out in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana) are at the origin of the constitution of the Bulgarian Guard.
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to set up a guard by saying that the organization's objective is "national self-defence".
According to them, over the past 17 years, Gypsies have "terroristized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, recalls the Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had generated lively debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations concerning the formation of their own guard as a means of resistance points to the increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The operation of the Hungarian Guard showing similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from reacting to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, as stated in the risk warning of Political Capital.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, research director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in this case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the holiday days and, around the holidays, it has become common to reorganise the working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Holidays are not uniform in the EU and the United States either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes national and state holidays as well as days of rest.
Days of rest are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the new year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the new year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that the awakeners can rest quietly.
In addition, in one year we have a total of eleven festivals marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday, commemorating the revolution of 1848, as was October 23 also commemorating the revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, May 1st is Labour Day and November 1 and 2, we remember the members of our family and our deceased friends.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
On the days of our state holidays, national or even religious rarely falling on a weekend, according to the calendar, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day left before or after the feast marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price for extended weekends by working or going to school on the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in a special regulation on the days of replacement of the days preceding or following the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, to civil servants and to persons working in the public service.
However, it does not apply to service companies, institutions running continuously and in service, by virtue of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, the working days will be changed only around the end of the year holidays: from 24 December, life stops almost all over the country because according to the experiences the majority of people do more overtime or take a vacation they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many parties fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized the first time around the Labour Day to allow employees to stay home four days in a row.
Saturday, April 25 will be a working day to have a rest day on Friday, May 2.
Another change is planned for October 23rd: Saturday October 18th will be a working day replacing Friday 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year will be marked by the holidays because from 24 December everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can bother colleagues terribly
E-mails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that bother us almost more: these are things that "beautify" the daily life of a workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble to others.
Examples.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," said a colleague.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them that he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, the thing is arranged with an apology.
Before you have painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
You're borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking, or they're right to be mad at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring any envelopes, post-it in your pocket because it can be annoying that there's no more envelopes and you need them right now.
You're talking about co-workers' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop the spread of gossip.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (suppositions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, do not abuse his trust!
Bury the shared information inside you and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
Are you saying you're sick without just cause?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick on the pretext of a tearing headache because you feel bad or feel you need rest that day, think about the fact that your work, your urgent business, your future missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you're not going to work or something could happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to tell your boss and colleagues so they won't be surprised at your absence the next day.
Frederic, sneezing, phone
You're getting into your job, but your co-workers' sneezing is brutally ripping you out of it?
You've become, unwittingly, witness to a phone conversation that you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with hummings, chantings, chatting aloud (which you lead above their heads), footbeats, big words or discontent expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
You're blaming the others for a mistake?
If your work is not done for the set deadline, you forget to send a mail or an important message, don't blame anyone for this forgetfulness!
Don't put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognise it if you have made a mistake and if it has had disadvantages for others, fix the fault!
Ask how you could fix your fault, fix the negligence!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Putting jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable for the office!
Do not use comfortable jogging even if your function allows!
Do not be neglected, respect your colleagues and yourself by dressing properly, and if your function requires it by putting on pretty and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We move slowly into the usual morning stopper.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin to which electronic effects are associated.
I'm raising the sound.
The music changes rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones of all time, then a female choir joins it as a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
Hungarian music has not spoiled us for a long time with a good quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the cap becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born from the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in Yonderboi's band before he set out on his own path, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe".
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop music, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.
Ferenc Török's season).
The formation playing at the beginning in small clubs began to be known by a larger audience when the magazine wan2 quoted their first album of 2002 among the fifty largest records in the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, together with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend that would also be competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have undoubtedly become "trendy" but no one asked them if they would like to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, he released a new and better record.
The album Cannot Walk Fly Instead, recently released, can open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
It was a line from the former group of Pécs de Balázs Zságer.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to air music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, a singer currently working in England with the band The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the first album at the Millennial Park.
On the album, we find a real tube for the radio, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
Everything is well (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop, but commercial music and sincere music.
The so-called alternatives, underground music can also be mediocre and made only to sell them and thus become commercial.
However, a good pop song can be sincere too.
The reception attitude also operates in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Abroad, especially in the west light music has older traditions.
The, people go to the concerts and not only young people about ten or twenty years old but also the oldest.
They follow with much more attention the changes that have taken place in light music because they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in knowing who or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I am obviously glad to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However, we have never made music for the market.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the audience is more important at concerts or mutual influence already works, but it is only seen in the elusive changes of the moment.
But I noticed that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Are you going to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even though sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
Rather, we are team players who have confidence in each other's musical presence and let her deploy.
At first, it was of course inevitable that our music would be compared to that of Yonderboi because we are many to leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: On the list of mr2 Petõfi, Wings of Love occupies the first place.
Many heard Zagar's name for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style did you consciously open up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We don't plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the final of the album to try to soften the orgy of sounds and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why were they - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a gospel choir.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth, which was later named Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The sequence of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me back then but of course we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and also at the concert it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their singing.
They were behind the stage, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is only due to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says that we have to forget a little about our ego, forget who comes from where, who goes or, you just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to also feel the euphoric state we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, none of the music creation process, we had more difficult songs during the mix.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for a long time, and then, little by little, everything set up like in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I've already "released" this record.
Right now, it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious trader at risk billions because of its inferiority complex
A cover-up fraudster.
Thus designates its former employee the French giant the Société générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
But it seems rather that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, in addition, cannot be considered incapable.
Unlike all major bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis of the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, who reported him to the police.
However, in keeping with Kerviel's testimony reported by the French media, including Le Monde, this man's transactions produced a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year.
The crisis is beyond the United States
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the American crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called "sub-prime" mortgages, granted to low-income clients or to those who had encountered difficulties in repayment in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it and he bet well.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to EUR 1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel said, adding that he did not, of course, keep anything for himself."
Throughout the interview, he confessed to distorting the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex Stock Exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who doesn't risk anything has nothing
Was he afraid to be discovered?
No, it's not.
"I thought the mere fact of getting $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where does his will to risk so big come from?
He arrived at his post only gradually.
He started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around 51 thousand dollars.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and in 2005 he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90 thousand.
Yet he knew that he would never win as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew I was much less considered than the others.
In view of my academic background and my professional and personal background", told investigators Kerviel.
Shortly after he took office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz actions, he won half a billion euros by relying on the decline of this title during the Londrès attacks.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we leave you in peace.
"It was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they suspected it.
"As long as I won, they were pretending to close their eyes."
This is when the start of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to cover the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of it.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who doesn't take a vacation is a trader who doesn't want to leave his book to another," Kerviel concludes.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, which could, in the coming years, contribute EUR 14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly SEK 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain approximately SEK 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will benefit from the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that the Czech Republic can obtain for these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage a sum of SEK 90.8 billion next year.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the enterprise.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more efficient management methods.
To date, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeal confirmed on Thursday the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (nearly 1.8 billion kronor).
Later, however, he was released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
If the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will or will not be incarcerated again, according to the AP agency, is not clear at the moment.
According to the president of the Ileana Pérez Court of Appeal, everything will now depend on the prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to foreign company accounts in Panama.
These were fictitious societies, and the accounts were actually owned by his family members and his closest supporters.
Part of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his electoral campaign in 2001.
The budget was adopted
That's how it is.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the government majority without opposition support.
The one for the current year passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who had prepared it and ČSSD could not afford its refusal.
Contrary to the agitated debate before the vote on the declaration of distrust to the government, this time, nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted this law without any problem, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's some sort of paradox.
Whether you like it or not, each chapter and each article are the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, albeit hidden behind the competition of power between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are of much more interest to the opinion than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three ills which the current budget is not able to solve at the same time:
The first is the large share of the legal mandate fees, which are not only made up of pensions, but also of social charges, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of the parties ČSSD and KSČM.
The second is a deficit economy, a consequence of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit in public finances, i.e. the deficit in cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit in the state budget that represents the greatest hazard.
It is public and relatively controlled.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued bulwark bonds, disproportionately in debt to their municipalities, in order to obtain new sources of investment, apart from taxes, tax duties and bank credits.
In past years, they managed to repay these debts by the mass sale of shares of distribution systems, in particular those of energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have this source.
Based solely on official and verifiable facts, it can be seen that:
Our economy has been going through for several years now, just like the rest of the world, a phase of growth and ČSSD does not fail to sell it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive governments of this party to regularize public finances.
Instead, they owed the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania or Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable manner than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls essentially on previous governments.
We are one of the countries that, at the global level, are the least at risk of poverty.
We therefore need no massive social programmes, which have, in recent years, unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated if a lag in the age limit for retirement and a reform of the pension system will not take place soon, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone in power will only administer it.
By simply exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism which makes ordinary costs repulsed by the cost of mandates.
The projected deficit of $70 billion in 2008 would be absolutely useless if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really don't want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we need to be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it manages to levy in taxes and taxes, the calm necessary to prepare new reform laws.
Only the latter will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be invested in money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take action at this concerted point, aimed at preventing or even reducing the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to solve the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the consulting company Economic Outlook Group in his report to clients.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 per cent to about 50 per cent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unreimbursed loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for further losses in billions.
"If the central banks have chosen this approach, it is because they have to really understand what can still happen," says the chief economist of ABN Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the U.S. economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after the interbank rate of Londrès, called LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market, was not reduced.
This meant that banks still feared mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly decreased their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further reduction in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Banks' approach will help to reverse the crisis, as it does not solve the main problem of the fall of the US real estate market.
President Klaus: the ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is expected to affect especially developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again spoke on the issue of global warming.
Criticism this time came down on the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of the ecologists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, consisting of a curious mix of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric accompanying it and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it's just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that his subject matter was of great importance to him and that was why he was so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often encounter only the caricature of my opinions".
From now on, interested people can read their positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, he nevertheless, in his opinion, has enough provisions to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician able to follow and appreciate scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The book's main conclusions are, in his view, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion on global warming by all researchers, the effects of current changes are neither too large nor too serious, they therefore pose no danger and, finally, the efforts made to influence climate change are useless, ineffective and unacceptablely costly.
All the more so since he had the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose unverified opinions on others, which he felt was a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to questions from those present, he explained on several occasions that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the benefits they bring".
In Vienna, Klaus had already spoken about this subject two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people have failed to renew their driver's license in time
Six hundred thousand drivers have allowed the deadline to expire and have failed to renew their old driving licences, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still apply for renewal, so that the authorities will be able to issue them a new licence before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid permit will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licences especially those who no longer want to drive.
While the municipalities report a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, the authorities in the capital are overwhelmed with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall satisfies about 2,000 customers a day.
There's a tail about half an hour.
In Prague, nearly 140.OO drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
The issuance of a new permit takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request delivery within a short period of five days.
In this case, the driver pays a supplement of five hundred kronor.
Drivers who fail to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and will use the road without a valid licence will face a fine as early as January.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer can also deal with the offence by using an amicable procedure.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine rises to SEK 2500.
According to old information, even a person who was not going to travel was liable to a fine.
In doing so it could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines not exceeding 1000 kroons.
However, according to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka, no one would face fines in tens of thousands.
According to him, a driver's licence is a document that people can decide whether to have it or not.
It is not like the identity card that must be valid without exceptions.
Persons who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driver's licence.
All you have to do is bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, drivers of vehicles are also forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with records from 1994 to 2000 have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the penalties for detective pacts with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kosařík, former police officers accused of conniving with David Berdych's gang, will make 13 and 10 years in prison respectively.
The Prague Higher Court thus sentenced them definitively by reducing their sentences by 1 and 2 years respectively.
Initially, the detections of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were liable to 14 and 12 years' imprisonment.
It is no longer possible to appeal against the judgment delivered today, only an appeal to the Higher Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also charged in this case, he is currently awaiting only the verdict of first instance.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials, which amount to more than 16 years in prison.
He cannot receive more.
In January, the Departmental Court found guilty for participation in 19 people holding up, the Supreme Court today dealt with the appeals of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants had been questioning the prosecution since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemia Court of Justice, police officers, after an agreement with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to criminals, covered the various holding-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang paid back 30 per cent of the larceny to Opava and Kosařík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
In essence, armed robbery against the victims has, in most cases, suffered serious damage to health, as well as abuse of the power of a public official and prohibited weapons.
During the house searches, police discovered illegally detained pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct fire sight or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from nearly 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of others guilty of further robbery.
Other men in the neighbourhood of Berdych are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
The main hearing has avoided, for the time being, Tomáš Pėta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they await a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of child substitution: 12 million
Counsel for the families affected Igor Veleba wants compensation of 12 million kroons plus costs from the hospital in Třebíč.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer of the hospital Ondřej Dostál is absolutely not in agreement with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," said Dostál at the end of the hearing.
"In order to be able to form an opinion on the counterproposal, we need the expert report which the opposing party commissioned to draft.
We will check whether it has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands," stressed Dostál.
The amount should, according to him, be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jaboliov family asked for a million kroner for each month in which she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, written for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the negotiations on compensation.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological harm and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better borne by men, although they have been confronted with remorse for not being able to prevent the substitution of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, remain less serene in the face of the current trauma and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summarized the content of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at the hospital in Třebíč on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents' homes - Nikola to the Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová in Jabolišov.
At the end of October, the governor of the Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil region handed over to each of the families SEK 100,000 for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital run by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are obliged by law to cover liability insurance.
In case of default, they must draw from the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
To date, the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated from the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was indeed he who had used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing Bolek Polívka's popularity," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comic.
Harabiš agrees.
"There's a job behind us for almost ten years.
Money search and event development," he said.
According to him, it is the money that is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and could benefit from it.
They are the ones who want to parasitize our work," he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used the title valašský král (Roi de Valašsko) for the first time in his television programme.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, it was not related to the plan to set up a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing passports from Valašské Království.
From a humorous action at the beginning there emerged a business and a lucrative business activity, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka accepted that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered the holders a sale on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the programme manež, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the project Valašské království," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was formed by Harabiš and his team, which devoted themselves intensively to the project.
Collaboration between today's enemy parties continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized an official coronation for Polívka in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, which culminated with the statement "of King Boleslav 1st elected forever".
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the tournament envisaged for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and the date yet.
"We don't want to go to work fast.
It would be something like the Kings' Parade in Slovakia.
The king would be elected for some time.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register," added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: elimination of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing unusual, the quality of speed change, of driving and also of manufacturing could, in many respects, be described as inferior to average.
At present, however, there is its successor, Peugeot 207, which is much better.
All the more so since the combi called SW goes a step further, I only have to think better.
When I was testing the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained for example about the head space on the back seats.
While there finished the complaints because the combi body means that even the great devils will, in this respect, be at ease.
Let's go see quickly.
I will speak very quickly about the inside so as not to repeat myself too much.
It's a pretty successful design, my only comment about the central tunnel that I think is poor.
There, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, since the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time for complaining about too short seats or backrests is over.
The lateral guidance also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for the space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is also sensitive there.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the already mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the trunk
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to assess this one as very well accessible (also thanks to the back swivel ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a fairly average figure compared to competition.
Apart from the Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic.
Comparing the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, the Peugeot remains very much behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to going on leave abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the underside remaining after the backrests of the rear seats were reversed perfectly straight, or a very low footstool.
120 horsepower spread over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pot blocked by a serpillar, then I can only be full of it.
Let's go through the rates
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well-equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with an Otto 1.4-litre engine of 329 900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
However, in addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle costs 531,900 Kč at the end of the day.
It's a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to Fabia's price and you'll get a very similar number.
So all we have to do is choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils into British schools is not working well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, causing concern among those living in the UK about the development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
The British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the inhabitants of origin turn into violence.
The case of northern Kent, where conflicts between remaining immigrants and immigrants of Slovak origin are beginning to increase, illustrates the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The disputes, the chicane and the fights between the students have been incorporated into the relations between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested a Slovak woman in Chatham who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends himself by claiming that the boy insulted him by racist speech.
The police also had to intervene following the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a young man climbed up the bus stop and started spitting at us.
When I told him to stop, he replied with apples and pears and then discovered his buttocks," described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the outsiders went so far as to describe conflicts with immigrants as a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between the original inhabitants and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks came to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30 thousand Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it's really an island of freedom.
Everything you expect from your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach a pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list only in its entirety, but enriched.
However, there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spaniards, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and transshipment site of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the chiefs of the American mafia, had it built, since everything that was a crime in the United States (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients, there were, among other things,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 50's of the last century, were circulating on the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
The stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
What about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of the Havana Bodeguita.
In the bar of the Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, we will mix the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigouli and fiats once imported have already long, in such a salty and wet, rotten climate.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is significantly decrepit, nowhere else in the vicinity there are as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
As tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
During the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but above all in Varader, on the coast of Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by small train enthusiasts.
The cane had returned from plantations in the sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how we can see small locomotives running, whose contemporary ones are not only in museums.
Where to direct your steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the best known places.
So there's no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise, it should be remembered that in the Hemingway property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viśales Valley to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogots, calcareous balloons, and rocks climb in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, with fertile soil caught in their bowels, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense vegetable carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco is probably grown of the best quality.
You will be able to meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Ancient town founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
It was the slave trade and the sugar trade that brought him glory and wealth.
The richness has been embodied in the beauty and the city-glass character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura,výrazně ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí teměř nosměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is so far away that again in the 1950s, there was no road linking this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We weren't building anything, and that's why we weren't demolishing anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time in Trinidad than an afternoon, then it is worth visiting interesting places in the surroundings, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Sugar Valley.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes alive after sunset and where the music does not stand until the early morning.
Baracoa
Some call this village located in the far east of Cuba the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads that lead there from Guantánamo have to cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has placed Cuba's eastern pitfall, thanks to its intact landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in reality, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus' journey) and from the hill where the old castle and the current El Castillo hotel are held, there are several mountain tables, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the mountain massif Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Sows and the island Isla de Pinos, the cabaret Tropicana, the sanctuary of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, the Santeria, the African religions practised by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this could be filled with pages.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, says Americans
The lack of troops and equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, the representatives of the countries with troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh in Scotland.
In addition to the increasing protest from the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States, through Defence Minister Robert Gates, has called for NATO troops to be more active this week, Britain sees as a priority the strengthening of Afghan government authority and the intensification of development aid.
"The evolution in Afghanistan is perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other is to allow the people to start a new development of the economy and security themselves," said British defence minister Des Browne to BBC.
Ninety per cent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is, according to US Army data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in Helmand province, located in the south of the country.
NATO countries have about 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, nearly a quarter of them in the south.
However, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limit and in the organization and equipment of the troops.
In concrete terms, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to give serious thought to the concrete objectives for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I'm not happy with what we have on earth and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told Reuters at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In recent months there have also been conflicts between the countries involved in the issue if all the allies actually do their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat demands they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun called this week German soldiers lazy.
"The fallen Afghans discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild counter-attacked by publishing a picture of a British troupe in a rugby game in southern Afghanistan.
The government's debt will rise to a trillion in 2009
The burden of a State debt exceeding 84,000 kronor is borne by each Czech.
The total debt rose at the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion kronor this year.
As a result of better-than-expected savings in the government budget, the Department has reduced the forecasted amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The debt of the State of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to SEK 842.7 billion.
In the nine months of this year it has therefore increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
Since June, however, it has decreased by 13.4 billion kronor.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on State debt from early October.
The burden of debt in excess of 84,000 kronor is borne by each Czech.
Over the past year, the State has owed itself more than NOK 111 billion.
"For the moment, it seems that, thanks to a smaller deficit forecast for next year, we could cross the border by only a trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns," said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor predicts: "We could exceed the trillion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the situation on the political scene was changing, that policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I don't expect this change," he said.
Debts grow
The debt of the State consists of the debts of the central government and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the State budget.
The debt of the State is financed by treasury bills, rents, direct borrowings or, for example, by borrowings from the European Investment Bank.
The government's domestic debt has increased this year from SEK 38.5 billion to SEK 719.4 billion.
The State's external debt has increased this year from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called marketable state reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kronor and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kronor.
The average debt liability of the State was 6.5 years.
"Total debt has increased inter-annually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which, given the current good health of the economy, is far too high a figure.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly due to the 20 per cent rents.
It is bad for the debt to grow, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be room for negotiation when pension reform comes", commented Pikora data.
Better than we expected
This is the result of the government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, which the government had planned to borrow NOK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of September, however, thanks to better-than-expected savings in the state budget, the Ministry reduced the expected amount to SEK 152.8 billion.
The sum consists mainly of the deficit in the state budget, which is clearly going to reach SEK 76 billion this year, in place of the originally planned SEK 91.3 billion.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources foreseen for the Czech Consolidation Agency, i.e. SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of NOK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of state pension securities for SEK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to SEK 1.8 billion.
She was now appearing before a court in Khartoum for appointing a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday evening by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and deportation, his lawyer said.
The British was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give Mohammed's name to a teddy bear while any representation of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was punished with whipping.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the United High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with violating Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code following several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6/7, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
"Hight names come out of the children's mouths, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says the director of the Robert Boulos school.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred first name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then produced a book for the class with the photo of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the prophet's portrayal as an insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, teaching at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said it was only an "innocent mistake".
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "never speak of religion in class".
The first name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, they did not reach agreement on the future status of the province at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, Wednesday morning, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were not able to reach a status agreement," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to honour their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"There are no immediate plans for violence, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist".
End of mediation on 10 December
The Troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final negotiating session since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the Security Council's granting of independence to Kosovo, are insisting on continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina expresses its readiness to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not agree in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," said the president of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's self-government plan "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
‘Domino effect'
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was still possible, warning the Kosovo Albanian majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said that it feared a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken exclusively by the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanians would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush wrestles Israeli-Palestinian agreement
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had reached an immediate agreement to enter into negotiations for a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must stop its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "road map" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty resolving all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues".
This term covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the US President, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be "global and thorough" and address all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others".
Going to the rostrum, Olmert pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and "an effort to close them in the course of 2008".
Bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for the implementation of its co-existing Palestinian and Israeli "vision of two states".
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had obtained a commitment to Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was behind a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, which offered Israel peace in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it tackles the roots of the conflict and its central aspects", Prince Saud said in his interview with the Arab-speaking daily newspaper with Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always in this type of fact various, official versions and rumours oppose each other.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was travelling on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., on Rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"It wasn't in operation but on patrol, and was travelling 40-50 km/h, without gyrophare," explains a police source.
A Kawazaki green motorcycle, "not approved, therefore not allowed to run on the public road" (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was travelling "at a very high speed".
"She hit the police car on her left, after a refusal of priority to the right," says a police officer.
The blood alcohol test on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The state of the car (before high, star windshield, bumper ripped out) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "facts of involuntary homicide and non-assistance to person in danger" to the IGPN, co-located with the departmental department of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, at a press conference, the prosecutor said that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, was excluding the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday evening, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that this mini-moto arrived relatively quickly on their left".
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the footholds on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday, a rumour quickly circulated in Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police officers left the premises very quickly, thus not helping the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious fault" with regard to this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which one must be very careful," said a police source.
Libération met with an eyewitness of those moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows giving precisely on the stage.
"We immediately came down, with my cousin who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," said the witness.
There was nothing to do."
He then saw "a completely hagard policeman, who was drinking.
Two others tried to revive one of the young, the fourth spoke on the phone."
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, with the certainty that the people present had of the unexpected situation of the young, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to the witness, the rescue arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed heart massages, in vain.
"I will not let it be said that the police services did not assist young people.
These young people were rescued.
Firefighters arrived right away.
Everything was done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
Tension rises in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since General Musharraf's establishment of a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against measures taken in the context of the state of emergency were injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
The latter responded by throwing stones, wounding police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, or police officers loaded and injured lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court's bar called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations reportedly took place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of the religious parties grouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president ''invited the population to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and detritus to those who took the oath before Musharraf'''.
''The promise of Musharraf no longer holds''
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to rule on the legality of President Musharraf's re-election to the presidential elections on 6 October, by indirect suffrage.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
''All that we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court'', the magistrate told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the head of the army and become a civilian president "no longer holds" after the establishment of the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government has denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf has been placed under house arrest by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three (36 per cent) pregnancies are not planned, according to a study conducted by the Institut national d'études démocratiques (Ined), forty years after the passing of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the IUD still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
However, the liberalization of contraception has allowed for a better "fertility control", according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Or calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and, if possible, in spring, a season considered the most enjoyable to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It took astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) more than seven hours of space work to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel, essential for the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated the records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "fabricated" by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday, when astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Shuttle Discovery, a large cylindrical room that would soon host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of docking dock for laboratory modules.
But we must be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was, therefore, to move a 17.5-ton solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, to station it at its final position.
After moving it, the crew began the redeployment of the solar panels of the module, which have a span of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged on almost a meter by a cable that got stuck.
The deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who originally had to perform a space shuttle Discovery control output, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracoler at the end of the 30 meters of length of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker (space walker) in the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very sleek, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this trained doctor was therefore tasked with "operating" the "injured" solar panel.
After accurately inspecting the damage, he severed the fault cable and installed some sort of "flints" on the damaged area.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker who remained near the airlock and, from the inside, by the other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a hockey mini-canne wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "ricolated" by astronauts aboard the station.
After the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before inventorying his tools and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS action is in sharp decline at present on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defence group has announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was forced to review its 2007 operational performance forecast due to delays caused by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost to compensate for the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to ''between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros including more than 1 billion for Airbus'', announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (OEBIT) for 2007 when its quarterly results are presented next Thursday, he adds without further figures.
The group also indicated that the estimate of the new charges was consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS' operating result fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the exit of the ballot box: the Russians will vote massively for President Putin's party, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, or even authoritarianism, after a very locked campaign.
Three days before the general elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends voters a televised message on public channels, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
It does so as the top of the list of united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is expected to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything out of it by receiving the foreign ambassadors, simply delivering a new charge against the West accused of interference - his favourite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and want honest, transparent and open elections," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from the point of view.
She denounces a campaign tainted with pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov says that "there has never been such a dirty election, even at the time of Yeltsin."
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, the former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains banned from visiting according to her lawyer.
"Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus"
Behind these unsuspended laws are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential elections, on 2 March 2008; the candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and the powerful united Russia party who would choose the government and the president?
In any case, both in the legislature and in the presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back a long way: civil society has fallen behind in this Christianised country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine revived the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population, especially since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by a certain economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "will voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility" which they had briefly demonstrated after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Tamara Cherednichenko, 54-year-old teacher, concludes: "What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored on 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were so far only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven states in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
As the process of ratification of the Agreement by all States has been completed, the opening of the Agreement has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will enable research to be carried out "in particular on the movement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers", explains Reto Meistern, the director of the archives run by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, opposed the public opening of these nominative documents because of the sensitivity of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants issued by the Gestapo had been collected after war for a practical purpose: to find civilians deported or subjected to compulsory work and, possibly, to provide proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, bilateral Indo-European trade already reaches nearly EUR 60 billion per year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
EU Foreign Ministers had given the European Commission a green light last April to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to EUR 60 billion a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will greatly boost both economies" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Peter Mandelson said.
Europe is the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "47 billion euros in goods" and "10 billion euros in services", said this week Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has not yet reached its potential. The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England acknowledges concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England said on Thursday that it was anxious to alleviate the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a press release.
The bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will thus be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, at the base rate and until 10 January.
This seems to be the first time that BoE has put on the five-week liquidity market in an open market operation.
These normally take place at a week.
In its communiqué, BoE added that it "holds ready to take further steps to maintain the rates" of interbank loans on a day-to-day basis in line with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829% Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6%, a higher rate since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the market by the Bank of England had been accompanied by a significant penalty rate which had deterred banks from using it.
According to rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums placed on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with a more secure discretion.
UMP and NC refuse consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
Included in a socialist "niche" (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined some ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national PS office, including the 50% increase in the employment premium, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the management of rents.
UMP and NC having voted against the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was adjourned following the general discussion which gave rise to exchanges, sometimes lively, between the majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
PS MP leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival is taking place
Following numerous rumours about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter/producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the British producer Melvin Benn's Republican Festival.
"For our company, it's an honour to work with someone who has inspired the current festival movement in America," said Billboard.com, C3's Charlie Jones.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, the director of Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the bar of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio and, in 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury "the most inspiring event" he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says that his company and Melvin Benn's company are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as a market and worked hard with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we got stuck in politics because of the current administration, says Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the population of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at the Grant Park in Chicago, after having stood out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a rural festival, while ours is instead taking place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a rural festival to the European and urban to the American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," said Charlie Jones.
The latter refused to reveal the terms of the agreement, but stated that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says that the capacity of this festival is "very great", like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavoured, but the music will be varied, in the hope of attracting all sorts of spectators," said Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood film sets to Montreal when none other than Terminator opposes it...
This mission of seduction is part of the duties of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to play in the hands of the "Governator"?
"We must be careful, it is the industry that decides where it is going.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go there.
Our role is to offer those they will judge the best," he says.
The race for festivals
For now, however, Denis Turcotte's priority is the promotion of cinema from here.
The Oscar race has begun.
It will be of all the festivals on the West Coast, whether it be Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, to present the Quebec films, highlight them and ensure that the directors do interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on display in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be an end-of-year rally on the stock exchange? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the arrival of the traditional rally at the end of the year.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange generally has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts based exclusively on statistics should not be made, since, given the current context, uncertainties lie in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is nourished by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of collateral alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of leakage to quality values both in long periods and in short periods".
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not free of volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is unknown, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, head of sales for BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
The Spanish stock exchange index, Ibex, has lost almost 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7%.
However not all experts have such a negative vision.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganisation of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert shade that things will be a little different this year because he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For his part, Federico Olucha, analyst of Inversis Banco, estimates that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound in the index that could be caused by the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst hopes these will be positive.
Analysts agree to select the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to new maximum counts.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some manufacturers "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, in the event that they start there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other builders like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be dominant in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
During the last seven years, only on two occasions the month of December was a month down.
The genuine end-of-year rally took place in 2003, during which the stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, the month of December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of the winnings (for the moment the Ibex has increased by 8.36 % since January) and if it succeeds to compute on its rally at the end of the year.
Banque Populaire will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in Spain's most commercial areas.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organizations, since it is the first group that has decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8:30 pm, and to open on Saturday from 10:00 am to 8:30 pm.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to amplify the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
It is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of its agencies on Saturdays instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the experience of the Banque Populaire will be decisive for other organizations to join or not to join this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
This is precisely what the Banque Populaire is looking for.
Attract autonomous customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and street shops chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 agencies throughout Spain in about 18 months, since it is not the opening of new agencies but the renovation of existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernize the branches it already has in the commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers of the various streets.
In this way, the amplification of schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more current design, with brighter colors.
The bank manager, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve large investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
Agencies, which will also have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave Streets, O'Donnell Streets and Gran Vía Streets in Madrid are the streets to have been chosen, and apparently successfully, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very broad schedules, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of the BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers', Rivero notes.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles its rival Antena 3's stock market value for the first time
We did it.
With this phrase Paolo Vasile, a delegate of Telecinco, yesterday expressed his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the chain he ran doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
One aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a small market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday with a 2.54 per cent increase.
This gain stabilizes its loss at 15.66 per cent over the past year.
The market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (an additional 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which sold 1.52% yesterday and which has accumulated a 40.5% decrease since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other joint ventures listed on the stock exchange is 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1,779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we will make it profitable in terms of audience '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to surpass the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the managing advisor of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
In order for this figure to be real, the television channel is expected to record a 3.6% increase in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to the $965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million) while TV's net revenues increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point out for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after purchasing 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
We have the official compromise to give at least 50 per cent, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is now showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decrease in expected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company decreased the forecast of Antenne's earnings from 3.5% to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel with its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the vote of the Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the aim of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by MPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of organizations to ensure that markets function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Law of the Securities Market, involves the modernisation of the financial markets, as it strengthens the protection of the investor, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Commission of the Market of Values (CNMV) and promotes the cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial advisory services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), financial consulting companies (FICs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and holding companies.
In addition, it increases the number of systems for the execution of transactions on financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and order internationalisation systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment services firms to disclose in the market information on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they conduct to facilitate control by the CNMV.
Through the Congressional Economy Commission, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that securitized debts will be considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has demonstrated itself with what happened with the debt of high-risk American mortgages (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of management to legally delimit the functions that graduates in the Economy may be 30 years after the approval in 1977, the Royal Decree which delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the authorization of the CNMV and who will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increases by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is used after Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on the price developments in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by offering data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same process used for the Harmonized Consumer Price Index, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the Advanced Indicator is only indicative, because it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data to be revealed on 14 December next.
"The CPI will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "temporal figure", but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has specified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential over monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12,000 million (€16,800 million) since it came into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to emerging credit from the Bank of England.
At that time it raised some record deposits above 25,000 million pounds, a figure that is gradually falling in two and a half months because of the distrust of its customers and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to seize around a quarter of the revenues of the British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to get those 18,000 million pounds remaining until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The magnate group Richard Branson, known for its Cree advertising campaign in the United Kingdom, intends to spend £50 million (about €70 million) a year in advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
This week Northern Rock named the Virgin Association's offer, in which three other companies participate, including his favourite to save him from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard arrested today early in the morning the current mayor of the Murcan commune of Totana (of the People's Party) because of his alleged relationship with the fabric of urban corruption discovered this week.
ADE plus, one of the town council secretaries and the municipal chief of police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's self Juan Morales, current right-wing deputy, and until then municipal councillor of the town hall, and who according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER Channel, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
The agents continue to search the municipal premises and those of the Urban Council and the possibility of further stops in the next few hours is not ruled out.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect of the urban corruption pattern discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As the SER Channel indicated yesterday to the lawyer of the congressman 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales' home with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
Moreover, according to sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged collection of Morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galicia-based construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
For the time being, there are eight people in detention.
Bono agrees to be the leader of the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to chair the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the list of the Spanish Socialist Party for Toledo for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
Thus the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced it during a press conference after the meeting that took place this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist Group that will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, who on 15 November last published his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career in order to devote himself to the fight against climate change within the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
Moreover, he pointed out that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the one who will preside over the Congress, in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens".
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak quietly and calmly is Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and his "know-how" and he did not want to act as if he already held his position in order not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider "a domination".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is subject to persecution without mercy, both skeptics of its predictions and those that give priority to other political and social battles, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is president of the government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and who even intends to sign a "new contract for the planet".
This approach obliges him to explain why the action, or inaction, of his Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's leadership of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto protocols.
Who are responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors has it occurred and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must clearly explain to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits of citizens will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings will be obliged to do, what economic consequences will this cause.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has been no and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it is about sacrifice and payment.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Costier, uncomfortable and threatening for business and individual accounts.
Until the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with slogans empty of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that do not speak, that do not denounce and that do not demand, beautify meetings and inspire tenderness.
Provided that this is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are travelling by bicycle or refreshed with the fan.
Mayor and Chief of the Totana Local Police arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcan locality of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel contractor suspected of possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the town hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the function of Urbanism City Council and to the municipal management company of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanise them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 housing units, after the payment of illegal commissions during the last parliamentary term.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested, but they are charged in the judicial investigation, which the Tribunal No. 1 of Totana is investigating.
The first six detainees have now reached a judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the former municipal councillor of Totana and currently autonomous MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is targeted by the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, has been imputed, as well as the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and the entrepreneur of Vigo (Galice) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of the Nuaria Group, through which the bribes were allegedly realized.
The investigation is carried out by the Urban Crimes Unit of the Central Operative Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority of which were carried out in companies linked to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
As a result, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry business in the region, which may have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcan municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 housing units, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana that have been re-qualified and its project would involve doubling the population of the municipality, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the Vigo car parks in Coruña, Venezuela and Fernando el Católico Square; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with yesterday's comment in Finland's most important newspaper (something at the head of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that he appeared there, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the course of Philosophy called public opinion as a consequence of the tragedy of the school of Jokela.
The culprit of the dead, a bachelor's student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counsellor in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily Helsingin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools".

A colleague passes the information on the introduction of Internet downloads into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be an offence punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than 400 euros is considered only as a fault (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value up to 1,000 euros is already considered an offence, but the penalty is less than that imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is less than the penalty imposed for downloading it (one article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the traffic of compact discs.
Participating in a tumultuous fight involves a sentence of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and the trafficking of CDs would involve a sentence of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors ' permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).

My attending physician told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled: 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less. '
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition imaging group of the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed".
The researchers observed that when both people guessed they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one received double, activation was greater.
I don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte for eight years has been relentlessly pursuing the Balkan war criminals from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which is in The Hague.
His term of office ends at the end of the year and Carla leaves with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former serbobosnio leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, which follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who chases fugitive criminals and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What kind of insurance does it fit me?
Motor vehicle insurance, which covers the driver in the face of possible losses, involves a significant expense which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Having a car is the main one.
Yes, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise is achieved through an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium awarded and in return becomes liable for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, sex, seniority of the driver's licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rate to be paid.
This is why people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, since statistics show that these people have a lower claim rate due to their caution.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing frequency the probability increases.
Many of the variables that insurers consider when determining the price of the premium.
That's why the driver needs to study the situation carefully in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will present the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an accessible price, as may be the low level of driving experience and seniority of the driver's licence.
Although the ideal way to be well-insured is to provide insurance at all risk, other, more cost-effective options exist.
The most forward-looking drivers can opt for free-of-charge all-risk insurance, so that they get insurance coverage at all risks but at a more accessible price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the claim amount.
"The part of the amount of the loss paid by the customer will be determined on the basis of the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," says Luis Noguera, the Spanish head of First Europa, an online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fires and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under the age of 25 try to be careful and avoid claims as much as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"The bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and the company's profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the bonuses, " clarified Noguera.
Beyond the age of 25 it becomes easier for drivers to enter into a contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose a risk insurance with franchise.
"Normally, young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired after an accident", says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is preferable for him to negotiate insurance at all risk, as long as his economic situation allows him to do so.
Marriages with children are considered by insurers to be the persons with the lowest claim rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case the best insurance would be insurance at any risk with deductible (may be 300 euros), or extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have a more relaxed driving and they have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a larger amount of franchises," judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, deductible risk insurance is preferable (i.e. 150 euros) or extended third-party insurance when the insurer has a high level of premium.
It has to be said that motor insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible losses, but also because it represents a significant expense, that is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighth in the finals
The Milan AC and Celtic Glasgow are coming together next Tuesday in San Siro looking for the point they lack to achieve their respective goals in closing the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify themselves.
The Italians have a total of ten points and they have already qualified on the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six points, and who receives Benfica who has four points, does not pass him.
These two Group D games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as the Milan AC is due to play the semi-finals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a place for the December 16 final.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic Glasgow knows that by winning he would stay first and ensure a better crossover in the eighth of the finals.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team might be enough to rank if Shakhtar Donetsk doesn't win, but she won't be able to compute only on that since with nine points the game goes back to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
In this way, the Milanese will try to poison the Scots' evening, who are confident that they will finish for the eighth final for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten in the last edition by a goal from Kaka during the overtimes (1-0).
While waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' the triumph would only return to the Shakhtar, in the event that the Celtic loses, to rank for the eighth of the final to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that the Benfica, although it is last and without possibilities to continue the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls initiated their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since the band dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at GM Place in Vancouver that the band's meeting was "glossy".
Around 20,000 people have exhausted the tickets to attend the concert which was the subject of a video in which is told the story of the band that was furious at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world tour coincided with the launch of a new album that resumed their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI published in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that the husband of 'Posh Spice' had given them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had banned him a few days before.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "did not see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' who left the band in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and who caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during an interview with the press, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feeling for Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl showed up for the last time in 1998.
First, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, a baby sitter army was waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will exhibit in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will show off on 23 December.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine is a source of alarm.
A dispute over the price of fermented gas between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by gas pipelines, and each pipeline is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel oil, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two, caused a decrease in supplies to the countries of the EU.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-supply monopoly company, tried in vain to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase as planned, its prices to Ukraine as it agreed to pay for 2008, up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts said that this would involve Ukraine, a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the talks, reminding us that we are a country through which most gas flows," said Ukrainian Minister of Economy Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters news agency.
"The fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions on transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused the interruption of Gazprom supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This has led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of European Union supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the checks to be carried out on its non-Community employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, said the Monitoring Committee.
The warning of the Reviser General, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no specific data on the number of overseas workers it employs.
His report nevertheless highlighted other decisive checks, carried out correctly on a sample of employees of five health authorities.
The reviewer-general conducted checks on extra-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28, a doctor of Iraqi origin in the service of the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after having darkened with his jeep, in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October because he was suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the United Kingdom.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out the checks of criminal precedents, the agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Precedents Review, thereby allowing employers to undertake controls over various countries.
"Although we have found that some personnel information has been verified, it is not done every time," the report says.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "Our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland said it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment checks can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-employment checks currently carried out work well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported that 1161 overseas workers, mostly doctors and nurses, were employed.
But the reviewer-general pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of the problems of identifying staff with open-ended contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are quite adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for overseas health service personnel.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government, together with the Health Committees, would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be published next month, and would commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment controls, valid for all employees, including overseas workers.

Ray Winstone, known for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his remarkable contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having filmed films such as Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the suite of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of Cristal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have given people like me access to cinema," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admired by this great current actor, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as "the Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.

Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia revealed yesterday that it had arrested 208 activists involved in organizing cells manipulating an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clergymen and the armed forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the cells of missile smugglers.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following Iraq's invasion.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Orientale Province, TV said.
Saudi Arabia quickly formed a group of 35,000 soldiers to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006 against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper quoted a statement by the Minister of the Interior, stating that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launcher" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants planned the counter-band of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 people among the detainees appear to have plotted the assassination of clergymen and armed forces.
The government asked the clergy to do more against Saudis in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and the Shiite Muslim government allied with the United States, considered heretic on the hard line of the Saudis Sunny.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many clergymen have collaborated with the authorities to support the royal family's policy that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by calls against the pro-Western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Significant efforts have been made by the armed forces over the past five months," said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medina organized into a "media cell" aimed at promoting "takfiri thought", the ideology of Muslim radicals Sunni which supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of having subsidized the activists.
Venus' climate could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists yesterday said Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live in.
Data from the European ship in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was thought before.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are practically the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago Venus may have had conditions similar to those on Earth, and may even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation has led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic changes in the climate.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from Earth's, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allow us to establish a scenario that billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a habitable surface."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was kidnapped by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the goods would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to everything
Mitt Romney stated that he was not up to the challenge as a presidential candidate to answer the questions of a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates have finally agreed to participate in the debate of You Tube, during which many ordinary voters have registered their questions, they submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, 28 November, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one that emerged from another debate in You Tube, when a snowman asked the Democrats their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers reflected much the conditions of the Republican party, a candidate in the next elections.
We don't know on what criteria, CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest on a single theme, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some voters to call when they would hear pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when the candidates spoke rudely.
The toughest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, leader of the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his term as Mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts, of employing illegal immigrants at home.
The two fighters became particularly fierce when asked whether they would be prepared to promote "amnesia" (offering illegals a regular status and the possibility of becoming citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, have managed to deepen this topic.
None of them has the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps thanks to the fact that they started fighting immigration before and in a more incisive way than the others.
In general, applicants, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, coupled with the concerns raised in particular by the affair of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourage Republicans to forget, or minimize the divisions between libertarians and Catholic conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked if the candidates believed in the contents of the Bible as a whole.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected that Mike Huckabee, in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism, would declare that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to stand for election.
The human race remains unusually open to everything.
Mr Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research into subsidies carried out by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles at Wednesday's debate.
These two have emerged from nothing, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party are unable to agree on who is the more known and traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate united the party early and convincingly with a message of success on the American grandeur bringing together the leaders.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The pains of the Labourers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the trend of British scandals, it is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no hotel bills from politicians in Paris, no extra-marital finger sucked.
But now a revelation attests that a rich businessman had masked for four years, under false names, his contributions to the present Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election project, stupidly insulting British intelligence that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped, on the contrary, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democratic leader, said that the terrifying Mr. Brown turned from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The acquisition of Northern Rock, a troubled bank on the edge of the crack, has demonstrated a lack of direction and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities revealed an incredible administrative blunder.
A trio of retired generals have launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against the cuts in military spending: they have proclaimed that being a minister of defence is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of shady donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the General Secretary of Labour (and his former head of vigilance) have caused them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading for the exit.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; the cabinets of ministers take stock; the press seeks bad stories; and the government becomes defensive and without any more objectives.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was Chancellor of the British Treasury.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the lengthy investigation of the party's funds "cash for members of the House of Lords", voters might think the opposite.
But the difficult situation that Mr. Brown is facing is not as tragic as it looks.
The gaffes are not so monstrous as members of the Tories party make it seem.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the cure, though painful, could be to realize Mr. Brown's Stalinist tendencies forever, in favor of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal over political donations is a good example.
Abrahams, a very special figure, who compares his donations to charity, said he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subsidizers of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know which contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr.Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the grant collection, who had spoken of the questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr.Brown is not involved: There is no evidence that he was aware of these steps, even though most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the Prime Minister has done half.
He quickly condemned the legislative flaw of his party, but he did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power rests on something he knows well, resorting to a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been flouted, it is the responsibility of the police.
In addition, there are many other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent committee of the Standards of Public Life, without a leader for six months, and preparing for a good reform on the financial side of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a partisan such as Mr Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate irreproachable integrity and solid skills.
Card scams.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there's blood in the water, it's normal to see sprawling fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is going through a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of credit to the consumer.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in fees and insolvency rates, which measures unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares, more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in consumer credit, partly due to the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
Costs and insolvencies are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration in rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A law change in 2005 in the United States, concerning personal bankruptcy, caused a steep fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of archives (and thus of insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt that consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the 2007 issue volume will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers may prefer to increase their debt now that fair mortgages have disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flows than to the value of assets, and so falling real estate prices may not have led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to issuers of credit securities.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if properties cost less than the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt would become a priority to replenish everything.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and more flexibly to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should in theory reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of shares.
"We're not going to wake up one morning and re-evaluate all the borrowings," said Gary Perlin, the director of Capital One.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a macabre future.
Be careful with the dorsal fins..
The British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were to testify to their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former financial director, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had first declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial scam in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the PLC group of the Royal Bank of Scotland, have become famous throughout Great Britain because of the two-year extradition proceedings.
In the United States, their case remains a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges brought against them in 2002 made Fastow aware that he was the subject of the government's investigation into Enron's debacle.
The accusations against the bankers, nicknamed "Natwest's three" say they came to Houston in 2000, to stage a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right hand, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, which helped him to rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary as nil, but in fact the three British already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought interest from the subsidiary's bank for £1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as interest on this company.
According to the accuser, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its shares in the subsidiary.
But in truth these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers would have earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others would have earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty for his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow was imprisoned for six years in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is imprisoned for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British were released following the payment of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions of debt or even offer its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse caused thousands of layoffs, over $60 billion in market value loss and over $2 billion in loss for pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former President General Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
No money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money, no money,
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly non-stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a representative of Gulfstream.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats, since it is more than a family aircraft or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Salon, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to raise the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to cars filled with diamonds like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a shiny orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a nice car, but nothing like our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
"With a boom in oil, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 1970s, the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest spenders.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another place in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are composed of 103,000 Russian millionaires worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research center.
(World Bank reported that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of Davis Morris, London jeweler.
She participated in the show for the first time with the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking around the lounge on Sunday night, the two real estate agents on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I looked at the cars and tried to choose between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The show seems to be aimed primarily at the new rich, the kind of Russian brand buyers willing to queue in the plugs to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinium cans, Mövenpick ice cream, custom billiard tables, apartments in Dubai and Gund teddy bears are on display.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, proudly seated at the Royal factory stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturing Delf, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"it is certain that Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the sellers have said here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years old are too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from brilliant logos to a kind of limited edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
In spite of this, thousands of people — millionaires, millionaires or tourists — survey the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, stated that he had sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold thread.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that equips cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also claimed to have sold to a Russian millionaire, the bright orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelet-like cars, for Rolls-Royce Phantoms, at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals to look like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a picture of his wife made of cubic zirconium, will not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles »
Although many of his Russian clients are rich, Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, except in cash," he said.
"There's more than you might think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company has set up four stands representing British telephone booths, filled with massive counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryev, the marketing director of the company, said that his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passers-by arrested to throw masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their motive, in the middle of this false wealth or holding a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire," Karyev said.
Unaccredited surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window at Just a Little Healthier restaurant and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the doors of the white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then the police patrol arrived.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," said Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, on Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone had died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark Police Department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture executed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, whom the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are waiting confidently for the results of toxicological tests which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should help solve this mysterious death which has saddened the high ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo was Assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious," Mr. McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"She would have done everything to protect me"
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two 14- and 11-year-old sons, as well as a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokeswoman for the Union County Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, stated that the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgery.
"It's a possibility to consider."
"the investigation continues."
The authorities said they had arrived at her house around 3:00.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities have not said much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was interrogated by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to figure out if part of the house is being used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Miss Castro's house where a wilted rose lay in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy said that since her arrival in Newark 25 years ago in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said, "you have to pay attention to this," he said.
"She was there when I arrived, and still there when I left.
"It was embarrassing"
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the effervescence of the global stock exchange.
The shares are blown up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm the credit conditions, later reducing the interest rates promoted by the soothing statements of the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets explode in Londrès, New York and all over Europe after Donald Kohn, No. 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, declared that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in agitated financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure irritable markets in the light of these new credit tensions, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence "in part reversed some improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this severe turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of future rigidity of financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into the US markets, and that later reductions in interest rates could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also allowed Wall Street to calm down with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest decline in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial tumult was accentuated by the statement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, announcing that it will dismiss 650 people, i.e., 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs of compensating for the heavy losses due to the losing bets of real estate loans.
Only 20 positions are planned in Londrès where the bank employs 1500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average increased by 331 points, i.e. 2.55% to 13,289.40, while the largest index, S&P 500, increased by 2.65%.
In Londrès, the FTSE 100 index took 165.5 points, i.e. 2.7% reaching 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index increased by 2.6% and the French CAC40 took 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in markets was highlighted by the strong demand for an auction of monthly sorted funds from the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a heavy rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and inject later funds into London's financial markets causing credit tensions has caused the British banks to grow at 6.59% following a sharp upturn since 12 November.
England is facing a call for judgment in relation to the criticisms of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer #6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And even more important in a context as wide as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the breeders who was there exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because Hugh Morris's office, the CEO of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national breeder, at least on a part-time basis.
The one who will not be able to win the number 6 race will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It's never easy to destroy what allows a man to get to the top of his profession while another will never get to the bottom, sometimes because of lack of luck more than because of lack of ability.
It is not only in the cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is this the right time for Bopara to emerge?
Is it just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which chooses between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both new executives with good qualifications, professionals, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the right level of a cricketer unless he is given at least one chance?
The figures are important not only in decisions but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed certain to play the first Test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first-class doors out of 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett only took 29 to the same average, but both have already experienced their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it will be Shah or Bopara who will play at Asgiriya Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and did well in the first, with five doors and 40 useful laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who also struggled to emerge, who managed to become the primary cricket of the Test, despite the fact that his double-cent scored against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
Probability predicts that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of young Bopara.
Both have good arguments.
In favor of Shah, his brilliant and considerable start at the 88 test innings in Bombay, 32 first-class cents against six for Bopara, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah made only ten laps during his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test at Lord, his Middlesex player city, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan again in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his impulses so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket field and he overwhelmed when he recently overturned himself on a 4x4 during a Volkswagen presentation, sponsored by England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was to take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who was looking at him from a distance, to ask him if "he had seen this?"
Bopara is by far the best drummer, his shooting appearance allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe it's the real art of selection?
I would be willing to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as the tea leaves suggest, it will be he who will play this weekend.
Buses take people back to work, and fight against al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, pouring out these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has regained normalcy.
Some have returned to fight against activists who have removed them from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of buses from the official government, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and since the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to move away for the time being.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the militia helped by the United States, drove Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm coming back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have attracted to the increasing lull in the capital since the American troops arrived, and to the continued formation of well-armed "groups of citizens" working with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say that they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the exiled visas that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, allegedly asked the Syrian government to limit in order to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people are said to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We didn't have a problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government not to give visas to Iraqis anymore, to force them to return to Iraq," said retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be partly explained by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
It is feared that a sudden influx of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back the fighting.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest federated state leads in vocational training, and even shines with the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that there is a deficit on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non-Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-detrition, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the training system of the Saarland, a system which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Sarrebruck in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies with a double or even triple degree.
This is reflected in the high proportion of foreign students in 15.6 per cent.
In addition, Saarland also leads the country's children to higher-than-average higher schools - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Saarland, we benefit from the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, an IW training expert.
More than one in five young people earn their academic title in a vocational school, so Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities of combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the double course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education in Sarrois has forced higher schools to carry out a marketing campaign in engineering subjects.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced tests of comparison throughout the federated state.
For children to start learning earlier, the last year of crèche is free of law - a model that in the meantime other states also copy.
Only future comparison studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable way.
In the PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of students at risk decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Saarland has not improved as much as other states.
Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of the Sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - we could otherwise gain points in this field.
Because the language of the neighbour is compulsory in high schools - even if the Sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be tick-tac other than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chavez will bring the half-hour clock back to the South American country.
Chavez, meanwhile, became a caricature in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
Anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, due to a case of hostages.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with the head of state or with the Colombian government.
"I cannot, already because of my dignity," said Chávez, who hastened a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate on the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe allegedly "crashed in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all mouths.
A new ringing of mobile phones is raging in the country: "Por quee no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the Internet.
It was pronounced by the king of Spain Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant arrests of the left-wing populists and told him to remain silent.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, according to a prognosis, real wage losses threaten German employees this year.
Experts have cited a variety of reasons to explain their pessimistic prognosis.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees are expected to expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the weak development of wages, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economics and Economic Research, at the newspaper "Bild".
There could also be new unemployment insurance charges for the employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the expected decrease in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, in the words of the SPD politician.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In total, prices rose by 3.0 per cent from year to year.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought until now: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and wind whirlwinds at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there is lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now proved this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightnings on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports Christopher Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous theory of cyprin, lightnings would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the corner stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If life has been there, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today there should be little living things on Venus' surface: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, sometimes there are temperatures of 500 degrees.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but she remains a twin," said Russell.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the ASE mission.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venusian research, since no more probes had been on their way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results which have now been presented in several articles of "Nature" do not only underline the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that there are more things in common with the Earth on our neighbouring planet than they were supposed to be at first sight.
Thus the researchers found, in addition to the wind whirlwinds already known at the North Pole, a whirlwind of clouds at the South Pole, which rotates even faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica Italian.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called evening or morning star revolves around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it turns much more slowly on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 Earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar, hardly reminds the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets have formed under similar conditions.
Of the two, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but was lost in space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has fixed itself to Earth as carbonate, it forms the bulk of the atmosphere on Venus.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands an end to the dispute between the parties over the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and sums up the great coalition to close the dispute over the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," Köhler told Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for the reception of the Dalai Lama by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even though I have respect for the differences between cultures," Köhler said.
It is well known that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against accusations that it would organize a new policy of China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of one China.
"China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the CDU.
Steinmeier complained in particular about the CDU's "front-door policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama was welcomed to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in German-Chinese relations.
Thus, the Chinese government has not only dismissed German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, has also frozen the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of both countries.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that the Dalai Lama's reception was a mistake.
China refused to allow European politicians to receive Tibet's spiritual leader in his official duties, and supported Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The words and actions of Dalai Lama would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Street fighting with the police, shooting, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those of France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not break out in the streets through violence, the German Minister of the Interior demanded.
Burning barricades, crackers shooting at the police with shotguns: after the serious youth riots in France, German Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We need to ensure that a social explosive does not build up at home and defuse itself into violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "Neue Presse" published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid transformations of social reality.
The Federation, the states and the municipalities were already working hard to reduce the problems, Schäuble said.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From the summits of integration to the conferences on Islam, this already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end to alert.
Schäuble points out at the same time as in the German suburbs, there are no sociological problems or from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Parisian agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police over the last few nights.
Also in Toulouse, cars and public buildings burned.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against "imitation effects".
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need for action.
Kolat emphasises that the quota of unemployed young people under 25 years of age who are immigrants would be above average.
Above all, more training should be provided.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities, however, added that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat urged: "But we still have to be careful."
Young people should be given "the opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, in the Paris suburbs of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with projectors.
Three arrests, as well as a few cars and garbage cans, were reported by the authorities.
Since the conference, a deployment of about 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, said Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie, after a visit to the suburbs.
On Tuesday night, almost 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
On the following night, the troubles overflowed in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the first elements of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The Utopian appearance of the Chancellor shows that the coalition is done with the background - and that there is nothing to expect from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After his deplorable speech in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and poor in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should, in the end, be governed by it.
The reproach of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel in a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it has made it clear to everyone how accurate this criticism is.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a politician in weightlessness, fleeing into foreign policy and even there remaining in the near future.
For example, climate protection: in this area, it welcomes the Heiligendam agreements over and over again, but does not say how climate objectives will have to be achieved in our country.
Even the praise of oneself - to have so little modesty, the head of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she clings to all-round formulas, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image as a pragmatist, who solves problems instead of beautifying the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
He has a few accessory sentences left for that.
In this respect, it is indicative of the number of times that she makes lapsus when it comes to family allowance.
Here, Merkel needs three start-ups to pronounce a half-precision sentence.
She's titrating in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favourites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates already erupts on the first subject.
He allegedly made New York a "refugee for the illegals," says Mitt Romney to his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The latter, on the other hand, was heavily criticized: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants" replied Giuliani and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates go up to the attack: as the Republican base also has no official favourites, the eight presidential candidates use the CNN debates above all to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur movies that Internet users have sent via Youtube are barely more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," says John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who is the only one in the round calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney is also being taught vigorously by Vietnam's veterans, when he refuses to condemn as torture what is called the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation that simulates drowning.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go in the meantime beyond the war in Iraq and the debates on torture is reflected in the reactions of the common hall in St. Petersburg, Florida.
Whether conservative values are leased or future tax increases are not allowed, applause pours into the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favourites are once again revealed.
"I made a mistake at that time," explains Romney contrite and apologizes to the base and the TV audience for having again been a supporter of abortion in 1994.
On the contrary, Giuliani passes through a node when asked for his opinion on literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns for the first time in civilian clothes.
One day after his withdrawal as head of the army, Pakistani powerman Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination ended.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was appointed on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcasted the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf swore to respect the Constitution and to act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his position as Chief of the Armed Forces to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and had thus bowed to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after it was taken over by a bloodless putsch, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By withdrawing from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had decreed on 3 November.
Soon after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfil another Western requirement.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, rejected all appeals against the controversial re-election of the head of state on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of Northern Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
The Krautrock fathers are coming back.
The German supergroups of the 1970s rejoined: the three members of the Harmonia group once again took their console in a concert in Berlin.
For their return were the recordings of their great success "Live 1974".
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left by Michael Rother, 57-year-old and in possession of a laptop and guitar.
To the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is curved on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, including a Beat.
And sometimes it is added inadvertently to a piece of traditional music.
That doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen themselves too much.
The fact that the band Harmonia plays again ensured a few months among the fans of Krautrock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is reason in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been missing so painfully for 32 years.
But why should German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
All the more so since what is deceitfully called "Krautrock" has always been more popular in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the Echo Prize in 2003 to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room as interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chile Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment had no limits.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene as an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the one and only.
The memory is thus already taken by Harmonia, because the trio existed only two years and during this period the impact power felt was much weaker than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother briefly helped out in Kraftwerk and finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, who was at the time perhaps the most radical German band.
Around 1973, Rother followed Cluster musicians into exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an old farm in the Weser, a 16th century ruin, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the "Kommune I" community, where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
Supposedly there was in the trash a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many hold Harmonia away from that.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia", and the next album was "De Luxe".
Because as serene and modest as music sounded, the band suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not for himself alone in search of self.
The CD "Live 1974" which just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as someone thinks they remember.
Rother expressed at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
It was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The group announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and established his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen" (flaming hearts).
Cluster revived in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmony has ever had.
We owe Griessem's Live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Her Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been dug up on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
The physical resurrection of Harmony takes place at the World Cultures House in Berlin.
Publicly funded, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also the inventor of Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire fluctuation margin of Krautrock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The place left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence hovers in the room in the middle of singular sounds: "The only true music, you listen to the future".
There are photos showing the producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
The projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar-wired tools are used for the formation of the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and the battery, to draw to the instruments unheard of sounds thanks to the instruments with effects built itself.
Today, electronic music is like electronic music.
The three in great technical flickers.
To this even the choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and we sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphase.
Krautrock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the flight of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia also now does not let himself be irritated by it anymore.
But what is most self-evident will be carefully covered on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
It can tap on someone's nerves (?) or grant fleeting moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "The Killing Peace", two films once again address the Balkan War.
But both don't convince.
The projects either rely too much on action and on exchanges of insane fire or on the contrary they are too tearing.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first: the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is precisely there, in the most gloomy hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man of the 1980s, because far too many nice and futile roles in women's sentimental films and far too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism have delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to still watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunter (why do today's films have to be as long and confused as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He gives a magnificent representation full of winks: in the background, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so kind: a man who has had his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a monument in ruins in his decline, nevertheless kept visible remains of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Kingdom Peace", which also releases this week, the endless series of failed films about the Balkan war.
The film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovar gunners, in which one of the two still falls in love quickly.
Although it is welcome that here the Serbs are not for once presented as the only causes of all the evils, this film as flat as a television film is lost far too quickly in the action and the exchanges of insane shots.
It remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, one can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party", why basically there was never a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who condition themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox", could perhaps have become, with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now".
Because the stories are strikingly similar: two males go on a small team in the forest, to accomplish something that the military cannot do and for both males, it becomes a journey in madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that we simply don't let Simon Hunt be the deserted cynical with a heart, as it is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute him a romantic adventure with a Bosnian murdered later.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, achieves that NATO, the CIA and all the world's bounty hunters have not succeeded in five years: catching the war criminal and leaving him for just revenge to the Muslim Bosnians.
It is so bad that the International Court of the Hague should be seized of a crime against cinematographic logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at large, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they have to be exceptionally agreed) not to conduct the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are this time so similar that a famous poem by Brecht comes to our mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassing, I see the veins of the swollen forehead, clearly: how tiring it is to be wicked."
Movies such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumescent heads, but which insinuate how tiring it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
We can add: there have never been any good films on South Africa.
Which is worth it every time: when a star hangs out on a hotbed or on a minefield, he then comes out with something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits go Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
Anyway, decades have always passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust movie with "Schindler's List."
Some films have yet to mature - those that are now worth classic works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" have in no way been celebrated unanimously in their time as masterpieces.
But perhaps we also know today simply too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And it delights writers with the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" have in fact become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we need to have the sarcastic and distracted artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Lemprière" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because certain things never change".
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, the men will always be murdered horrifyingly and the war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collected the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's retreat from Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics met with fierce criticism in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of chances.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, the principal director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, described on Wednesday an abandonment as "bad for the local economy".
Recently, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the Olympiad idea.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same measures."
Schmidt-Trenz invites the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes another modified agenda as its starting point".
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday in his previous statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic until at least 2028.
"It's not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
It refers to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December regarding Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means to us that, in the time that we had planned until 2028 until then, we will have no chance."
However the dream does not definitely belong to the past, said Von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It's too early to close an opportunity, burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the reception in the plenary assembly of the German Federation of Higher Sports Schools.
There, Von Beust would have described Hamburg's candidacy at the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Sports Schools had first in the past weeks appointed Hamburg as a candidate city.
The mayor's SPD party blamed the Senate for not using this precious time in housing construction in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was refused by the Senate for years because it played the Olympiad map and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always claimed for the Petit Grasbrook an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor".
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have raised a great deal of enthusiasm in Hamburg.
Hamburg, however, had broken down against Leipzig.
It's not Warhols' crates.
Whoever connects the Swedish concepts with the wooden case, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or maybe?
At the moment, wooden cases made in Sweden cast shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Stockholm Type" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned a few months ago the authenticity of Andy Warhol's 1968 Brillo-Boxes, the internal research of the Stockholm Moderna Museet now leads to a disillusioning result: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hulten Museum gave in 1995 to the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm Type", which circulate on the international art market.
Ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorical productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden cases, based on the red-blue-white design of the "Brillo" powdered soap cartons.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden cases produced in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden cases that at the time would have entered the history of art and auction, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Stockhol type".
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum wrongly later claimed that about a hundred wooden cases had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have given him.
In fact, the 105 cases of Hulten were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Byström, chief curator of the Moderna Museet, examined, next to the six Brillo-Boxes of the museum, three other Swedish private collections, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminate panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies that date back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a layer of background on the laminate panels, using a roller of paint - moreover it is not an oil painting, but an acrylic.
"These crates have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes", suggests the director of Moderna Museet, Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the Moderna Museet will classify the six crates in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board of course announced that it would investigate the "heavy accusations" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cases.
But since then we've had an inexorable silence there.
Manila's Rebellious Soldiers Give Up
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers gave up, the same ones who had broken into a hotel in Manila, and who had demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to power had shortly before stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had fallen into the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse himself with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers, who normally had to monitor them, had apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the soldiers' actions.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who was in command before the Scouts Rangers elite unit, said that other units in the army wanted to join the march soon.
The regime's critics had called for a major demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The finance district of Manila was already the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 members of the army against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurrection broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven coup attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a main shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured a stake of more than 20 per cent in Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company communicated on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We'd already speculated about a buy-back before.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we are seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German market for DSL, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The credit institution would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The day before, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million on the Stock Exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million euros for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on cooperation in the marketing of DSL products and mobile telephony.
"We are strengthening our partnership," said a spokesperson for United Internet.
Both companies founded the MSP holding company in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to feel satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to use their additional 18.49 percent right to endorse at Freenet, said United Internet on Thursday.
The two companies would, however, be left open all the options, particularly to increase participation in the Freenet SA, we learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The still difficult to predict poker on Freenet, which has been going on for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecom market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet Holding and Drillisch had to date a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent.
It was now agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas had already been decided in August.
