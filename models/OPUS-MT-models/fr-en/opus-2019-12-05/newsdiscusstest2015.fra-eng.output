The remaining UKIP people who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You're talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS shouldn't be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First you use specious arguments, then you discredit them with a barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to line up behind those intolerant to chronic hypocondria who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one using specious arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing lunatics, hardly exists.
I think that's what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a rag is not evidence.
Yes, shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, it only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in that country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a specious argument is.
You also don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when trying to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage's sentence surprised a lot, but only because we talk so rarely about this problem.
He made absolutely no homophobic remark.
You're gonna have to get over it.
I'm not sure what you're getting at, but I guess you don't like when the media talk about what you don't like.
We rarely talk about it because unlike Farage and his crazy disciples in Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of god and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are a good thing, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis that is coming the austerity period will not have fixed anything.
Hoping for almost 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland was the "TIGRE OF EUROPE" we were told a few years ago.
We've known the rest!
This resumes reading the article.
There is an attempt to suggest that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a "NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE" is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxation on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, a continuing migration.
With these ingredients not enough to "pavoize" for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, the Irish were one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with the Portuguese considering a constant perimetre, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
The Grece was in front.
That their development has not been a long, quiet river, it is sure in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
According to a report released in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in general in France.
Only SMEs pay full fees.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new cars (and chere) at every corner of the street, just like before the crisis of 2008.
I have lived in Dublin for 14 years, and the recovery has been evident in daily traffic since the beginning of the school year.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon ignite.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a clash on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so some bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I fly with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of those two once they've been raided.
Then it would be entirely the other pilot's fault.
Did Ryanair charge passengers a surcharge for the additional fear they were kindly provided with?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I got on a plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give it to heart.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair from those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic rate have to go after themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays are going to be and whether it is going to be necessary to compensate the passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was an error by the airport air traffic controllers.
The passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowds with people.
People do not come in mass for the quality of restaurants (most of them) or for the Salon de la revue Ã  l'Espace des Blancs-Manteaux (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the stores are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of strangers spending.....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, full of people with 50% tourists.
@ aloes False!
The only argument that I would consider admissible is that of the areas receiving a large number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they are buying tax.
Tourism areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
The industry remains where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, can lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right enjoyed by employees, with exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they lock her up.
What's the use of the law?
To satisfy some of the population and businesses who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my town of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And this is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against her will, used to pay the inheritance fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, some are not terrible.
Probably his estate would want his share of the cake, if you gave me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists / Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole, and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Me neither.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he stood up to the other government aristos who wanted to discuss a "deal" with the Nazis and he won very skilfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had Churchill on the stand for five years, just those five years, and no one else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the inheritance expenses, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when this was "the moment of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for his country during the Second World War.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real evil of francai: s mistrust of dialogue
Return to princeps values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either jointly and severally we come to his help, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he provides or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer to the smic matches that vision.
There is also the lessor who lives on the income of his property.
It is necessary to distinguish between those who invest for a return at the time of retirement and those who live from their pensions.
A property for rent or two for a couple on top, it's a vice
The little genius of Finance is particularly unimaginative.
The new deal was a policy of great works, but at a time of lack of great infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline is emerging in response to a recession that is only a savage decline so brutal
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, motorways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less harsh, then the need for investment is shocking: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high incomes and annuitants.
Who's in power?
obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's profits are being undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple's introduction in mid-September of bigger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and decided to use the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition we all have different needs and they cannot be met by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not value design, for them options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for "a better platform."
Is there "a better car manufacturer," not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and should be encouraged.
That is in our common interest.
I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it's not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our Umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, are fighting ideas and not men (on the contrary, of course on Parisian bobos) could tell us what the author is if they are fighting ideas about gender and tell us what works they intend to fight precisely.
Or do they just attack the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, Jean, I like you, and you're a smart, cultured person.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato evoking Holopherne, rapprochement that had not come to me (I have no vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "background," since you are referring to it, I am not interested in this subject, and I honestly do not see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who's afraid is asking the world?
But what do we fear those who are afraid of?
Furasato and @ give us some answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic throat cutter.
We can see how these studies affect the most intimate of them.
We are obviously no longer in the idea debate.
It's something else, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: Regarding an idea debate I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only point of view of their critics (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me to be very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, that's all the difference between having an enlightened opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat slicer, I contented myself with the "second sex" (it was more than my time) which I believe is the source of the "source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I was looking at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon showed up briefly when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of sometimes having the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night's cloud would really hold the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Special flash blood moon.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will return its true colour to it as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so naturally I only saw clouds.
Melbourne also managed to cover itself throughout the week with the meteor rain of the Perseids and for almost all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I'm beginning to think there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I could not see the eclipse because of the clouds over the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on that eclipse.
QUICONQUE looks at this eclipse should pay for a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last thought before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess you when he eventually (necessarily) disappears?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions by looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse THEM of being obsessed.
Superb picture of the moon over the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between income from labour and capital.
Nothing about tax evasion.

The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
No hyperlink to the original documents so you can get an opinion.
Go see today Tuesday, October 15 the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at the lowest in five years.
In Greece the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these are the examples to follow.
The reform of notaries would generate a claim of some EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economy tells us that these claims for compensation are not well founded.
What if the Ministry of Economy misses?
Will the decision-makers who have gained the political benefit of the courageous attack by notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The next one in his time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@ lol No the State is not comparable to households as regards the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is bordered by the lifetime of its members.
Moreover, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments that will contribute to the growth of tomorrow and hence to future revenues.
Some elements of the answer.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of the world's pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all else.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately the truth doesn't match your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands bound by the law as written by the policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical procedures, safe shooting rooms for addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues politicians want to please the uneducated masses.
By the way, doctors don't make money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health care system to look like the United States, you should find out how it works.
Doctors around the world are courted in the same way, but it's more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to blame the Tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and "research."
Read the few reports on our expenditures on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the world prices of drugs present everywhere, as well as the differences between countries on what is over-the-counter or prescription only.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, direct or indirect.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite the laws that hinder them and the costly permits that are needed.
While manufacturers of some drugs may not be happy with alternatives such as marijuana, those who arrive at a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and the pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put the chip in the ear of a hospital official.
We can't DETEND patents on grass...
If social science "researchers" did research rather than policy and networking, one could use their "work."
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy not research.
It is not possible to say "the research is completed it must be applied" and then in the same jet "it must be experimented with everything."
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not successful, why are you asking us to apply it?
Can I be explained how a "researcher" can infer that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow students to learn on the condition that they learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator. Let us make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What's the point of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a desire for self-promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to keep the sophists and ideologists away from training, which practitioners teach to practitioners.
manufacture reread the paragraph on traineeships (which unfortunately is not very well argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: "It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of current practices, and that does not allow the system to progress."
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it cannot be hoped that only practitioners will teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical and who has never set foot in an operating unit before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems in the education system.
Giving more weight to educational theorists would destroy it permanently.
Your analogy is totally messy: if I would not like to be operated by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I would even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the job.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative Member of Parliament for Combating Copyright Violations by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thank you.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright, I'll just have to read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = vol.
It is the same since they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright violation.
Not the same thing at all.
By using content without a proper license, you deprive artists of their livelihood.
You can always argue about pedantic hypotheses - but it's robbery.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
It's a copyright violation.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start feeling guilty of violating copyright
Obviously, you don't mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon all intellectual property on the site under the general terms and conditions they have passed with one click.
Maybe if they share the headphones of their ballerium3 with a boyfriend on the school bus, they should be evicted for breaking the law in such a way.
Ah, if we could export this resource that we're full of, the grater that says everything's wrong...
If it is said by a PS Member, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France pulls people down by continuously assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down is speeches like yours.
@ gus I've been working in a private company for a long time.
I had the CHANCE of having worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I'm an employee because I know I don't have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the lame bosses I meet frequently.
At ease in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he tells the horrible truth!
@ gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly cite to demand reforms in France, in Germany the companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large companies and medium and small ones - what do the French bosses expect to do so??
Have the state hold their hand?
That state they accuse of imperialism?
@ Jacques L.
Always this anti-business verse from you!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so harsh?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France is facing an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French entrepreneurs who are unable to create jobs and who are moving and undermining while waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employers' charges, taxes, work 45 hours a week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages or their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
Which is ironic given the way people always complain about First Group.
From where I'm from, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to stay afloat rather than transform themselves.
That doesn't mean the Scottish railways haven't improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do this, unfortunately.
I tried to get them recently, but I couldn't.
But the Labour is gonna get us out of trouble, isn't it?
It's an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
There is nothing to prevent people in the UK from setting up a more moral business and taking part in tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all of it so that the decision was finally rescinded.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and believes that all workers must help each other across borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
Perhaps this is because the Dutch are on the right track, whereas the British are not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership, but above all new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
"She was a beating girl."
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "beaten" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, the fact of being "beaten" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "fledglings," who are nevertheless dead, I know palanques.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's do it again, too.
I'm not telling you this is THE condition to manage, I'm telling you it helps..
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When to the examples of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, if only for a moment, that you may have merit in coming out of a disease or that you may despise not to come out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that lets go, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
I'm sorry to think the opposite way, if having a strong morale is likely to make it easier to accept heavy treatments and to prepare for them, to try experimental treatments as this woman did and not to refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is a medical fighter is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to rely on the "lord," it's something else.
Neither with the merit nor with the courage.
These considerations are unique to moralists.
When you catch a piece of dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of becoming a zombie.
Personally I caught two of them, filth, fat, and if I "fought" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight is just to tighten your teeth, to suffer hell and to take the blows.
I thought the charge against Milosevic was decided and finalized about ten years ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted "quickly" and then swept under the carpet.
Is that the story we told back then?
The Communist who became a nationalist who triggered three wars in the Balkans over the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under THE MOINDRE rule of international law?
What country did Serbia attack?
With regard to RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he'd be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was quickly recognized by the Western states that then lied from start to finish about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not understanding the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we did not like him).
To my knowledge there is only in Greece a method of prediction of earthquakes works approximately, measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
Such studies are undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
A hope therefore but prudence is necessary This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years from the Earth in the constellation Cygnus which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules," according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Just like those involving animals feeling a threat coming up.
Thank you Science Passer to delight us, often, with these experimental prowess that are realized in the world.
How will animals know (in advance)?
Probably by the perception of other elements whose rate changes in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odourless for humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act in a strange way a few hours with an earthquake, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an arte report recounting the struggle of two scientific teams, one from California and the other from Japan, to make recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to Earth's magnetic fields, and more particularly to their modification before a seism.
So of course I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Where are we on this research?
Why so much contempt for this lead?
We should learn to listen to nature again...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious review, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by animals, we encounter the same bias: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the goldfish turned strangely in circles.
I don't understand how anyone would think Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't help but think that this man doesn't know anything about it and that he's always trying to distract with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep one.
That just underlines how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was on "Have I Got News For You."
Because she's a celebrity and we've taught people how to worship celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will die the ceiling I'm sure.
God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they used to say about Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French really and always disinterested themselves in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have taken the trouble to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent of B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "Scrap Strait" speak, unfortunately as much as the dead who stayed there.
We understand that Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be there from the bottom since the Battle of Savo) do not want to go back.

More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of some adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation of Kosovar origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, formerly in Juventus and now in FenerbahÃ§e, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still on the team
It's Bisevac the Lyon defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was mid-field or earlier in the 70s and 80s and trained many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in Velez's great team, which, under the tutelage of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also included scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and ArsÃ¨ne Wenger's loyal teammate Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at the Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn * shivering *
Now I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not in charge.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is, the flag of this drone is not the flag of real Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which covers all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (as I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with a map not of the so-called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give parts of the country to the neighbouring countries.
How could one have felt "an explosion of joy" when two towers collapsed knowing that women, men and probably children were inside?
How???
What bothers me a little bit in this "testimony," is that the only fact of having been able, if only once, spontaneously to rejoice at the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with the utmost caution.
No doubt, in the short moment of "joy," we did not think of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We just thought, for a moment, that for once Muslims had managed to really and apocalyptically hurt the great evil Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch of powerful.
Grandiose.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims who are swallowed by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonials filmed in Palestine.
Classic Schadenfreude.
We thought so.
The Western "Christian / White / Gaulish" cannot measure the degree of fruition, anger, hatred of the Musuman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today's Muslim Arab world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendour, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How do we get the Muslim world out of this evil funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascizing nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
That we've figured it out before, don't push the Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Has Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, humid and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
Besides, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the summer green when everything is alive instead of about to die.
In Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, so don't make your grumpy clichÃ©!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to the outside germs, it can change, I guess.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a feverness that culminates with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and lots of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of increases for children, it is the amount collected by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10.
However, in terms of the number of households that have seen their taxes increase as a result of this measure, deciles 4 and 5 are mainly concerned (median income) according to Graph 2.
The deletion of the half share, especially for widows, is not addressed at all in the article or rather its impact is completely undervalued: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And it's not ready to work it out.
Well, we're not on the straw, but we're thinking.
For once the PS makes a policy rather left we're not gonna cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear far more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let us continue and you will encourage these 20% to work less or to leave.
Well, I know it's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and OIC recycled to PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population holds 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it forbids anyone to raise as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit money loses all its usefulness.
And once the value of money has been exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is, to make the misfortune of many.
We're among the richest 20%.
Probably also of the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or maybe as much to give up and live on social minima, especially if you have social housing.
The utopias of the red Khmer head cutters have happily lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to go to the reception or deal with any hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's place, sleep there, put it behind you and go back.
From now on, this will be my first option when I'm on a trip.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases you will need some kind of owner's insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the right logo!
Ah, six hours too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly risky." No, it's not true.
You just really missed your luck.
Based on the link provided in the article:
At its disposal, Airbnb's response to Teman was quick, almost absurd fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an e-mail provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
Then why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I'm thinking of paying a down payment and a month's rent at once, but I'm a little afraid of sending Â£1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
Where are we going?
"Support the troops," sang the Bu $herie on all tones...
So harmless weapons.
I am sure it will be a pleasure for the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their relatives and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombardment of sadam hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
Moreover, how would the mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not very clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: This is ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be greatly strengthened if "them" were to work 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
At present, our teachers earn more than engineers.
And let us not be made to believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their curriculum.
But it can't be seen since National Education does not have the means to provide an office in the middle school / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced telework, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the stash at 5: 00 per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with math, come on, we're waiting for you.
What do you mean, you don't want to stick with poorly educated bitches whose parents spit on you calling you a wanker?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadis so that the Khurde population can flourish better.
Where you can see that the Bush administration has done everything wrong.
My first graduate job was in sales, in London, to earn three times nothing, and yet it was a job for which a degree was required.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London subway, it was paid Â£5,000 more a year and we weren't even asking for the patent.
I never regretted it.
In this regard, don't worry if you don't find a graduate job, try to find something that pays well, or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I'd still be paying my student loan.
I don't really like working in companies, so I hope to eventually move on to the public service or to the academic world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year backlog.
How best to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of the bisouns like art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, so-called unemployed graduates.
I have one of those degrees and I'm a production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the diploma but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Although the starting salary was lower, the steps were quickly moved up because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate between engineering studies and artistic disciplines has been going on for years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are bishonords?
This is ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about degrees like media studies or whatever the absconse stream you went to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real subjects.
We need people who can explain the great questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and who put them to the fore.
Wouldn't it be better to have a real territorial policy to defuse Paris and boost the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the end-of-town of Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80 km back and forth every day by bike to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belt residents already have many other, more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> A number of secure and locked parks, as already exists in northern European cities, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They might as well benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find a place for ONE bike hook-up device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand DelanoÃ«....
Well, that's not okay at all.
When discussing with pedestrians and other public transport users the reasons why they do not pedal it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1 / it's super dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters who drive super fast and don't care about the survival of bikes 2 / one takes a lot of pollution in the head. For me, the cycle tracks are better off, you have to reduce the traffic (urban toll type congestion charge), reduce the speed (Paris = zone 30), make the road code by systematically verbaling (even the bikes near flat passages that you have to adapt the road code written for cars 100 years ago to the bikes).
Bicycle paths are apartheid, we must live together but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word on the place of cycling in public transport?
EELV is right.
The target of 15% Velo travel is ridiculous.
I'm starting to think Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
Moreover, according to OR reports, the EELV assistants seem skeptical.
I'd rather be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it's better to find out who's really behind this massacre.
Index: This is not Russia.
I'm not sure I like the way the world is changing.
That sounds horrible.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint had indeed been lodged.
In addition, they should file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not at fault, the fault lies with the authority responsible for airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air attacks against the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocent people so that airlines pay for the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls defending their usurper government / ultranationalists from Western Ukraine - and who want to show basically that Putin shot down flight MH17.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The precedent: a 1986 ruling of the International Court of Justice which concluded that the CIA's supply of arms to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There's no way Russia's letting this case go to the ICJ.
It's funny to think that Abbott means telling Putin that Australians have been murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators haven't said anything like that.
Your name is Ricardo and being such a beotian in eco, it's shocking!
To be called Polar is to lose the north is to rejoice.
Only one Beotian question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently have not read it!
It's easy to read, it took me a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of income from labour, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of capital today is in line with that of the beginning of the 20th century before 1914, it shows that it is the two world wars that have reduced the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: you say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has a few limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, we can debate it without reading the book, the main one of which is to argue in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did it take you to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it, and I won't read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is this one that seems to me to be pure fumisterie.
The notion of the gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has not humanity been enriched overall?
And this enrichment added to population growth is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and definitely deserves the prize.
But remember, she's only 17.
An age when most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this prize will not be a burden for the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
My best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that it is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Did anyone think his speech was a little strange?
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn't where she was now, she would have been married at 14.
Isn't Malala herself one of those "colorful perverts"?
You should not have any "airtime" on this site.
You are, yourself, a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father ran a school where girls were enrolled and he was in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, that she receives a higher education and has the right to decide her own marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she was saying is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at the age of 14, without having a say.
I'm sorry she didn't make it clear enough for you.
It may seem contradictory, but maybe she means that if her father hadn't given her freedom, she would have been married at 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry into season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who visibly has a little trouble finding her soy character from Marlene Dietrich.
I just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The production is close to perfection and the show by Jessica Lange singing Bowie's Anachronic Life on Mars is simply overturning.
I haven't looked at this new season yet (which will be the last one for me, without Lange Bof Bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I'd rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is on, apart from Jessica Lange's extraordinary, it is above all the risks of staging and montages that I felt.
We have in AHS an avalanche of original plans that ridicule the aseptic of today's productions.
I'm a little out of my mind to see you throw the sponge in advance for the next few seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge its quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, as you say so well, there are many other things.
No, it's just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series outside the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants to do too much at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours of what.
But everyone does what they want!
It's by what I say, "I won't look again" that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
Jessica Lange's loss, I think she'll be fatal to her.
But then, that's just what I think.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut instead in government spending.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
Those who wanted to sabotage the expenses failed.
Putting out polemics about relatively small expenditure items, such as development assistance
The problem is that this is less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the change of direction that voters seem to be calling for, and throughout this time, some in every camp pretend that these nuances are far more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditures.
"Debt" is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem with the government taking one third of my income (even before I talk about consumption taxes) if I thought it would be used appropriately.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage was not entirely honest about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines that are almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that makes the tax of Labour and Lib-Dem look ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first Â£10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns Â£35 000 a year will pay about Â£5 000 (one seventh of their salary), someone with Â£50 000 would pay around Â£10 000 (one fifth), etc., and someone with Â£200 000 will pay about Â£70 000 (just over a third).
What about the social security contributions?
Plus social security contributions, plus local taxes, plus parking and car stickers, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and car sticker.
I get paid in a decent way, but not in an extravagant way.
Not that it's a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But let's not pretend that money falls from the sky, or that it doesn't matter where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed person looking for work at the door-to-door prove it?
Even so, 20% of the unemployed would not be looking, which means that 80% are looking and do not find.
Being unemployed myself, do I have a better interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CVs, that increases my chances.
Actually, I haven't heard from PÃ´le Emploi in months, which means that agents are more busy with screening operations than actually getting job advertisements in?
I don't see the point.
Because it's not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then Pole Employment must be dispensed with.
What is a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in this case we make sure that the unemployed perform their duties properly in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport licence from users of a means of transport, a head of department or employees of their work, etc.
Nobody yells at scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed worth recalling that the unemployed have rights: the only two times I have dealt with PÃ´le Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the cases, reduced by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not a law expert.
PÃ´le Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should only concern employees, they are the ones who pay the costs.
Policies and self-employed French people grant themselves rights that they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the enhancement of paid work.
More than waiting for murder tweets in Arabic...
In reality, we need a direct military response in Iraq / Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this zone of conflict.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348 / 9 in connection with the war and the displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to prohibit this year the Hadj at Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El Pais reported that 7,400 had their visa applications refused because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted smallpox at Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it heartless to propose that the Ebola patients be prevented from flying to Europe?
I thought it was just common sense, but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of ten thousand people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed under strict quarantine.
No one's going out.
Only health workers can get in.
21 days waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they get Ebola while they're there, they stay there until they're cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Last week alone, people were infected after having had contact with people in West Africa although they took "all the necessary precautions."
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is spread mainly by airlines.
Let's forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, airport customs officers should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately quarantined.
May he succeed in conveying the message of the first individual and the second (including religious) group and will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect into dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
He's still a long way from that conception there.
It has only been 20 years since information appeared as humanity's given bonus, while religion, the result of the cerebellum, has been leading our actions since Lucy perhaps.
What's the point of becoming an umpteenth Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to adhere to it.
Those who criticize would not, in any case, set foot in the Church; it is only necessary to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@ louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe this will make it possible to touch more people...
@ Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you see it preexisted at Christ.
Hillel a century before already said to him: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!."
Christianity goes far beyond mere reciprocity but introduces agapÃª.
Your "advancing justice, peace, brotherhood" but without god?
This is a return to communism?: -)
Next step: we remove the incarnation and the resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has changed moral laws by redefining the respect of others.
Christians will then be ready to assume their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and forcibly converted and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant between buying this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming out soon.
It can't be invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don't think it's worth Â£30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at Â£30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at Â£30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The computer department's joy flap blocks all cool sites.
Hello, is this Â£30 then 20% discount, or does the Â£30 include the 20% discount?
Attention: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but can't play it.
Plus I bought it on Steam, so no payback, it sucks.
It's time to buy a new video card.
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon Â£30 for PC, Â£35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, Â£44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they would erase it from your library if they decided to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
Join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was the France of 1940 a "putrid soil"?
Say, this Nobel Prize guy looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Do we have to love France of 40, that of "strange defeat"?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the award-winning authors.
Brazilians, Chinese or Australians will read Modiano, which is already hard to read in French and which describes such a limited and self-centered universe?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant connection with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
That would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They'll know how to appreciate Mr.
Modiano to its fair value, if they don't already know it!
For your part, continue to frequent Levy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso retain all their chances.
So let's see who got the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hey, you ugly guys.
Ever since I drove one to Iceland, I've been seeing Kia Sportages everywhere.
I think this thing's been following me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or swallow me like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not just CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real beginner's chance I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to 95, I'll be as bright as he is.
Last night I went to a fancy cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came in with a slice of bacon on it.
I admire Mr.
Read a little Buddha and you'll understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
Having said that, I don't want to upset you, but I think you're getting a little away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of mosques.
It reports arms trafficking without delay.
Either we have eyes wide open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have eyes wide closed.
You have to choose.
It's not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but again, you are making a monumental opposite-sense: all the authorities, organisations or representative associations, Muslim or not, having formally condemned the ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say a word consents.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they demonstrate publicly in order to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
In my view, this principle is the negation of the republic and can only contribute to delaying French society.
If there's no doubt, you might as well say it.
Who doesn't say word consents, but consents to what?
Suitable for close proximity to EI or conviction of EI.
Silence is convenient, it is the main weapon of those who want to spare the goat and the cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically untenable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "take revenge" on the parties represented in Westminster during the elections because there was a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified by the idea of losing all those seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a shit about Scotland because they don't have any seats there.
They can do what they want with electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to shed a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs ask their leader to be held accountable.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats are not from the Conservatives, they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that is the most important thing.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
To target the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs can no longer vote on matters concerning England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists, and it worked well for her.
However, he is still competing for prime minister in 2015, since winning the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "The Life of Others" from East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long term, it will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I am waiting for the next post: Amazon manufactures YOUR book according to YOUR profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's a cheerful world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, the management of DRMs is not implemented, I still have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or bought from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a bug.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am amazed at the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your bookseller, you will always notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn * c, d * * itre,...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably derisory.
For example, James Joyce's "Finnegans Wake."
@ Thomas: In the Big Data era, the data doesn't really need to be personal to be relevant.
Be careful not to put all the literature in the same bin.
Anonymous data collection when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
It is the data published by Kobo that is so, which makes it impossible to identify the readers or the authors.
But Kobo has all this information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of schizophrenic children on acid.
It is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think that Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine.; -)
Well seen: -P But Turkey doesn't want to shoot itself in the foot, unless it gets something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will retaliate, so it's actually shooting herself in the foot.
A retired diplomat writes on his blog: "The PA reports that Iran warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad as it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran would send a serious warning of retaliation or simply advise caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises is that today's Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region. "
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the differences between the traditional media. The short article you link is important and should be read bearing in mind the previous realistic observations / warnings from Iran proposed from Afghanistan around 1979-1980.
Who are these "moderates" who are seriously fighting the horrible secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world towards abime and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existent "moderate" ones pay more attention to facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in mind.
We need a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we "have"?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have a chance to be alive?
A little late for that, buddy...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Especially concerning the triumvirate of the CUP who planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a poor place in Central Asia at about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a Turkish empire there.
What a fool!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
All clichÃ©s without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a surrogate mother.
Lesbian couples may just have a desire to be a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Hetero-sterile couples, too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them future psychological unbalanced.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their living and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
GPA is no doubt a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine in our world.
It's not from today.
Many women have borne and delivered children that were not their husbands.
This is still the case, so we are made...
The important thing is that this practice should be framed so that the "commodification" of the body is limited.
But are cosmetic surgery, cosmetics not as much commodification of bodies?!
Anakronik Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a maid in distant country numb via internet and Pay Pal than to accept his responsibilities and or to avoid scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all rooftops!...
These practices were also not done in the name of the church!...
There are not only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late '70s in the Midlands I only saw it from a distance.
I had to go all day because I had no right to go at night!
But if you liked it and you listen to the music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they are posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there's an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of the culture of Northern England.
No wonder that Paul Mason understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampired by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including a lot of Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story," but here's a little article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
Great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria / Exchange and get off at Wallgate.
Gobbing pills.
Whatever the station before Wigan was Ince, 15 minutes walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the stop after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the police series George Gently entitled Gently Northern Soul, which took place in Newcastle in 1968.
Business is getting more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@ Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace since he wants to continue to occupy and colonize (indeed, it was also the case of Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters have all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, laid them on the rock, and entered into the water.
An Israeli stole them from him.
The Israeli representative rose up angry and vocifera: "What are you talking about?
The Israelis were not even there at the time! "
The Palestinian representative smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of Palestinian authority and will not lower the guard...
That anti-Israelis don't like it is obvious, it's not the aim...
AntiZionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical relationship...
And this has always been the case since politics became globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it persists!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What balance of power has allowed Israel to be created?
Anti-Zionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a balance of power!
Do you doubt it?!!!...
Besides, it's not all about Russell Brand, but the Guardian's reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskyist billievesÃ©es written not others.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It's just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old girl likes it, which would mean it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a hint of awareness that Russell Brand is telling some truths, maybe truths that we prefer not to think about.
Hang in there, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks in a pretentious way and after all the absurdities of tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a beginner populist, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross hands and ignore the whole political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles / videos he posted, it says that voting once every five years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting democratic engagement to it is completely useless, both parties (to a slightly different degree) governing essentially in favour of particular interests, multinational corporations and rich people, at no time does it say that simply ignore politics completely because these parties do not govern politically at the local level, insist on movements, demonstrations, petitions, no matter, and try to influence politics from there rather than just voting and disconnect for five years, people should become much more active at the local level.
I am not saying that I necessarily agree with his solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting his requests can go hand in hand with the fact of voting, since politicians are girouettes who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is a matter of raging to see all these condescending answers that say that this fool who makes Jesus tells young people not to bother to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people debated what he actually said rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and setting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The voting thing has been completely distorted.
The futility of dragging a ballot paper into a ballot box every five years makes me deeply angry because my vote really does not count for anything.
I want more referenda, electronic voting, direct democracy and Members reporting locally to their constituents.
In addition, I dispute the idea that Russell Brand's words are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even if they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counter-culture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskyist billievesÃ©es."
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headaches added to the montage!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russel but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding what he's getting at.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by the traditional media - including the Guardian - for generations.
This "fronde" reveals above all to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the historical meetings where trade historians have become a minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished to the benefit of condensed ready-to-think type Sciences Po for press records.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to attack a culprit, a scapegoat.
They develop both very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these scapegoats who are the keystone of their thinking.
Instead, I believe that Foucault felt that the state was indispensable as a guilty party.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem of the relationship to the other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchizing, neo-lib and / or / or libertarian slope (of the two terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to seek the help of the state for its markets) in the sense at least of state / not at all state at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself calmly.
His thought is built on the guilt of the State: without this guilt she does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals mentioned here.
Nor support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too fast if you took Foucault's texts on the Iranian revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel through this...
Gauchet puts forward a profound reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the mechanism of accession in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he's an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cabal orchestrated by researchers in the humanities of the hard left who can't stand the fact that we are without allegiance to their mantras, is quite laughable.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the posture of these "rebels," which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "yellow" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends on this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I last saw a Chinese guy.
In London and they were sympathetic to me when they found out I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same thing about white people!
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them say violently anti-white.
My dad's not happy that his older daughter's dating a white guy.
I also believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are becoming richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, Russians are mostly prejudiced against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or faced with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the river Ienissei, in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the Australian views on the Chinese and Aborigines.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two of them in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories of them, all people are being valiant and, in fact, those in London were very nice that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise we don't remember who we met, all people are equal, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a sort of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there's a lot of chance the parents of these white guys would attack them PHYSICALLY.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all the battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the trade union of the judiciary...
@ Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly brand right.
In the Judicial Union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made on the basis of relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
That of the observer's political vision and that of the magistrate's factual interpretation.
It remains the necessary tool of the law to refocus evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of judges, including prosecutors, forces a distinction to be made between the error and the bias of judges.
It would be futile to claim that acts of justice were not distributed among these three groups.
Allegation and ignorance are not an objective analysis.
And so if all this is not analysed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
Only by implicitly revealing statistics does it start from a low point.
The previous preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
Corruption * of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the nuisance * power conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The area in question is that of the despoilment * of heirs committed until by means of procedural scams * by genealogists estate commissioned by notaries.
This profession obtains a good year 150 million euros while benefiting from the cover * provided by the quasi-judicial impunity * of the French notary.
For an understanding of their mechanism, some of them have been reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is in line with this statistical improvement * moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in numerous disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be thereby robbed, a whole set of jurisprudence contrary to all laws favourable to heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics which ignore such rational criteria an elaborate form of lie?
Totally prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam people with disabilities.
You can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, custom-built to his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, taste and color...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The Tankchair looks EPIC.
I don't think the inventor of the Whill ever had to clean a dog poop on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard inclination.
Here there are hills that they would like.
Prices actually seem high, but there really are people who put that kind of price in a bike, so "you see."
The off-road tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all disabled people are poor, though.
Many of them have reasonable insurance.
Only if they became disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things that they know we need.
You can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it's just a draft, it's not intended to be made.
I am CONTENT that the "long distance" wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza, during intensive shelling of densely populated residential areas.
Two million people have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying Power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
The eight-year-olds lived their whole lives under Israeli blockade!
The unique situation in the world, the unacceptable situation, the illegal situation as well, since this blockade imposes a "collective punishment" on all civilians in Gaza.
"Entrepreneurs who are working on their projects are diverting a little bit of their cement to the black market..."
Ah, that's not the wooden tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
AntiZionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, it's certain, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been trapped in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-guarded land: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Blocus is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress built against the people who have chosen their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
A lot of people are just looking for a one-night shot at Couchsurfing.
So it's getting paid (or at least hoping for it) in another way.
It's always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and process directly in cash, bypassing Airbnb.
Where's the community in all this.
"What's she putting on for rent?"
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The word "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you haven't noticed.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure that it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers to allow them to engage in a commercial activity there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (honestly) on Airbnb, in short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and painted, sunken, etc.?
The barges are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All those Somali immigrants who come here and attack our barges...
Where are you going to dock it?
No Marine The Pen is not right!
Populism?
There is no truth other than the one that exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
Increasing wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism will not be impoverished!
High finance, speculate, plays with our companies therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our foodstuffs therefore our food, with the care structures therefore our health, with our debts therefore our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold..
All this to the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild Bank Minister of Economy to better defend the interests of banksters, who were solely responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Wasn't there anyone else skilled?
What do you call it, flip his jacket, drop his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
Actually, we don't know what Marine The Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I'm not sure Spee really "refused" to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if that was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after sunset, making any rescue operations more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malvinas, where, in photos showing the survivors being rescued, we see a calm sea in broad daylight.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two battleship cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after having stopped firing, and a race-chase began.
The Leipzig saw something on fire, but when he got closer he saw that it was just a wreck.
The NÃ¼rnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, bent and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his spotlights at the vessel's flag, the offer to surrender was refused and he opened the fire, finally casting the vessel.
Without reliable information, von Spee decided that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10: 15.
Concerned about reports of a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north. "
So, if that is true, the Germans, in the dark before the radar was invented, did not know that a ship had sunk, and therefore could not look for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have damaged them severely, so in confusion they ran away to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes have been taken by the UMP to request that it be included in the law that a permanently convicted elected person be permanently ineligible for election.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the elected left of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROMOTE A REGISTRATION TO THE MAGISTRATE CONS MUR
When will the ban on trade unions in the sectors already protected?
How long will this distortion of equality among citizens be tolerated?
Intervened by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to soften the very ones who will take advantage of their irremovable ability to hinder the actions of the real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is commensurate with their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little signs "money for justice" they came from the provinces and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold at the service of its party.
It would not defend the same arguments if right-wing, or even extreme right-wing, trade unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your assertions are totally free.
If, at the moment, the right is financing the news of the court, it is simply that it has committed acts that fall within its scope!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with justice, but not all those who have been the subject of its attention have received preferential treatment.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the left-wing Judicial Union is not the only judicial union and is a minority.
Let a minister support trade unions with so much commitment to show how useful they can be.
@ MCR The union you mention may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it is not a secret.
The question now arises as to whether the "mission" of some judges is no more dirty than instructing.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the DM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
@ Pivoine: You forget that magistrates are not civil servants like others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the most glory-hungry moron realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I'd be surprised if someone accepted their offer.
Many used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills stadiums all over the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, which, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, CÃ©line Dion, Cliff Richard, all did the Eurovision competition, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else have competed in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens to most celebrities who don't compete anyway.
There are few who, after one tube, succeed in making others.
In any case, most singers / bands can at best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, only has fans in the UK.
His fame comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar-smoking friggers in their father's garage and throw three chords on a primary school poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to touch before even releasing an album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied - a distance that turns fairly quickly to racism, because the sacraalist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and entangled with ritual bigotry, while most of their ways of doing things are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, by practical considerations in everyday life.
Except that you interpret recklessly in the opposite direction.
Either, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our MoliÃ¨res do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object confined to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article in any case.
It's deco ephemere to furnish the emptiness.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred always lives on.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the nests interpretations not at all scientific that last the life of a Mandarin, rarely less.
When's a comparative critique of the disciplines so we can have a little fun?
Because what applies to archaeology also applies to interpretations given by other disciplines.
That would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, to understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and previously archaeologists relied on their "instincts" and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Today we have so many technical and scientific means that the interloan of excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
Here we are in the middle (and old) of a controversy about the Shamanism advanced by the prehistorian Jean Clottes (cf his book "The Shamans of Prehistory," especially the re-edition augmented of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could get on with it.
So we're done?
I don't really understand. Why can't we just go on with three?
This paper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the gutter?
No, but we're not against a play on this.
We wouldn't be able to watch a musical on that, though, it would be too gay!
We could expect that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost over, may I suggest you go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their peril.
Instead of having those childish ass jokes laughed at.
Not very clever.
Go away, then.
If these "childish ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
You also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is this the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
Nevertheless we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net...??
The FOM chose not to show these images only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the pilots, it would have taken out the safety because when another vehicle (such as a tow truck) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it appropriate to advance the time of departure (right TV, pub, money...).
But other than that, they protect the pilots well.
Well seen, I also share that view.
But there is also that if the very British FOM brings in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at the restart a chance to beat the English that led then...
You're leaning on this blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I have a little time to find out all your clothes.
No, just no.
There have been lots of F1 conspiracies, but never one that puts commissioners in danger of death for a distant story of one pilot's chance of victory at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out the safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the commissioner wanders a green flag in the middle of the intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the complete video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag agitated, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is no longer under yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misconception of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under yellow flag AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of commissaries just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 metres as it is 100 metres after the accident) shakes green to tell the pilots to return to a normal look.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
Before I thought the media was an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I'm afraid, in the end, it's just for the money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sex, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex life.
The news does exactly the same thing.
Doing the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
"When the tabloids are coughing about Ebola, we all catch the fear" It should be "derailing," not "coughing."
Given the medical reference, "coughing" is much better said in this context than "derailing."
I wonder if all the people who are worried that Ebola could start to spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You do them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that delusions nicely and solidly this abject pseudo-journalism.
That made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media are talking about most things with that optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us afraid and anxious enough (without getting hysteria) for the government to get us out of the way when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to suffer a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has itself invented.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to still be of this world almost 35 years later.
Besides, at first it must have been horrible, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there.....
Testimony perfectly useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are testimonials useless: taken in isolation, they cannot be used as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
@ traffic: Testimonies cannot be used as scientific material.
This may be the reason why patients in psychiatry are not asked questions when they have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric records mention that my mother psychiatrist explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) is useless in a scientific approach?
So what do you base your research on, then?
On fantasies?
You put fantasy theories and facts on the same level (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the bogus word adulted by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who think they are great psychologists after reading D'ansembourg.
@ Jim: There are lots of meaningless buzzwords in psychos.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of "resilience."
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have mimicked us with a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and Company??
Doesn't that remind you of Team America?
Seriously, it's * not * a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
And why is that?
It was a great show and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us therefore leave our salvation to the almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they gonna get the kids to hang on?
The only solution that comes to mind is pee-pee humor, which would kill the show.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging up.
Ah, because it's a children's show?
The UKIP works for the Mysterons.
Why don't you keep your Team America?
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is well done.: -)
I can't wait to see this (though it's an adult), but I hope it will give an idea to a channel to rebroadcast old people.
The show has almost never stopped broadcasting here in Australia; it's been at least 40 years since we've had one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6: 00 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-class commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And the half-hour episodes are now at 05: 30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Temple Mount" in or under the esplanade mosque!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli excavations under and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have failed to find anything.
The temple mount if it exists it is elsewhere.
Maybe in Argentina?
This mountain is not wanted for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, rises in the middle of Omar's mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad went up to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham failed to sacrifice his son Isaac.
As long as it has been taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind them regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the 2-state plan, and it has been constantly overhauled!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize his own?
The shortest Jewish joke: "God be praised!"
To praise tourism in Israel, we are often shown young, half-undressed naÃ¯ades, alanguies on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, quite different from what the advertisement shows us, as can be seen in the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this photo is a magnificent piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that Reuters' photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to rock the Jewish faithful below, praying to the Wall for lamentations.
@ Mat, If this photo bothers you, it is not the newspaper, nor the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she transmits must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is through revolution.
Since the economy seems to be on the run, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are lucky to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time, without hiding, they have given ever higher wages to the top-ranking little elite.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will only change in this country when the workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of bitching and moaning when someone else strikes, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not just about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't fuck people with impunity.
Unless we give up democracy, in which case it's tenable.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like, for example, China and India.
Not all of this can end well.
It's because we're in a democracy that it held.
Did you vote for the TTIP?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of companies owned by these people by bypassing national governments through secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage this agreement will have to our lives.
It is only recently that we are beginning to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you will understand what is being negotiated behind your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
These have great spin-offs, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in XVIII there were unions in all the regiments
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let her (at last, her officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe that she is the safe of France's eternal values, and she will fight and close her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalisation, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still lack the sindicatesof married men, celibates, married women, celibates, lost dogs and I don't know what yet.
If you don't write the French properly, I'm a union member.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
In order to defend the interests of the categories, the protected professions with trade unions are already suffering enough, which has created a breach of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh at the fear of risk on the part of a public servant.
We can imagine a system that guarantees freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike, as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise disaster insured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What safety are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other civil servants, since this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker shall participate in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of undertakings. "
This is absolutely essential with the advent of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off review."????
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, it was Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some of them were well seasoned.
In Joffrey's wedding episode we have one of the best moments (though deceptive: wine) in the history of television.
Also, pie mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has done anything like "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow down to your master!"
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and relatives out there finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these outsiders were kept away.
And there's also the idea of "playing security, there's always next week" that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I can't imagine doing that to myself.
I am grateful to those who do and so offer us great entertainment and push us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and had to do one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to divide, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could find was the rather dry base (although I agree with Hollywood that the green icing on Richard's mill didn't make sense, Richard had already lost at that time anyway).
I must admit that many of the challenges in this series seem somewhat artificial because of the time allotted.
There is also cancer waiting, with the sunburn.
We're definitely doing it right now.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind with ultraviolet radiation.
UV is blocked mainly by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "drive" ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would even be more, and therefore less UV and "cancers."
It's a good thing the ozone layer doesn't block the UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancer-causing UVC and lets the UVA and most UVBs pass through.
Do you know that you don't have to be a condescending person and consider your interlocutor a stranger when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to be pedagogical.
Without saying that I am used to melanoma, the UV makes only ACCELER its development.
They won't.
As a proof: not all tanned people have melanomas.
So, when a doctor tells you to avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary for every human.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we bend it?
And, more importantly, can we get him to the blender?
Or put it in the blender...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable for its intended use.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as a front-line communications equipment.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it
Except a Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
We make this joke every time we talk.
I've decided to count them.
This is the fourth joke about folding that I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before specific software is installed, it is assumed that the telephone has been removed from the main production line and it is hard to see how it could return.
So, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm@@
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don't know how they do these things at all.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or CE logo and the presence of a prototype red connector.
ah article for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrialists produce in "industrialists' We highlight super u but all the brands and even the small trade are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650 â¬(average salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put their priorities where they hear them.
For my part, food is one.
Go without a grudge, I'll kiss you
We call bobos, or better boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological "software" that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It's the total thought-reason unbundling.
They are experts in management, for example claim to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuferie, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of burdensome ideology and tartufery, too, do not be surprised to encounter criticism of them often.
Wow, thank you for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the details associated (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I'm not in it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecolos are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left-caviar?
Well, you're able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in ecolos at all.
The boboecolo is one of them, but it is only the most visible band of ecolos because it is the one that inflicts the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe.
She's so badly done, she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shh, you're next to the plate.
You have to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to make a comment since you have not spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and still seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulous rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
This is art.
No, it's pig.
The fact that Emin can't draw
That's not really a fact.
Rather, it is an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs who smoke playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Designing is more than just representing the real.
If you're only looking for this, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still room for savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer in active service....
I (Honesty obliges us to say that France is decreasing its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes even more drastic, starting with Great Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without the support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, as we observe the weaknesses and shortcomings of our defence tool, particularly in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuarization?
@ edmond: That's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have been around the military thing, little or no, dare come and say here, with eyes in their eyes, that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting with laughter...
That we apply the same potion to the public service as a whole, and public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: really relaxed: look at the inflation of public employment in other ministries and you will understand why Defence can feel a little loaded!
Well, yes, the savings that everyone agrees they have to be done, must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of potty, those on whom it falls groan at the murder when it happens at home, the poor cherishes.
We should do some, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Val de Grace weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, the story is repeated every time a post, maternity, hospital, barracks are closed.
But everyone is for the savings of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and doesn't like the savings in public spending.
This article is really the most staggering thing I've ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is a shame to scroll through his Facebook thread and see that 80% of his friends started their statutes with the phrase "This embarrassing moment."
I think they're gonna make a movie of it.
He will probably be basing himself on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus on the way to work and only realizes there that his skirt has entered his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and tighten his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
God, I have to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe of satirical journalism!
I'm falling to the reverse!
It is imperative that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible excitement and unsurpassed genius that springs from Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine glow.
God, that was really bad.
Especially if they're not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of regional policies and effective associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are confiscated from the right to save our planet by states that play the tartuffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, as citizens, to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted with energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away...
Translate: Wind turbines and solar farms are the Round points of tomorrow.
The whole is financed by the person responsible.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful to its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully controlled, it should be limited to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity from renewable sources to fight CO2 emissions?
France is in no way concerned.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions at production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by wind or PV is already more GHGs on the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate intermittent.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind power or PV would run counter to the fight against CO2.
Christial I am not insulting you I am a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 plus I did research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove to be contrary to what I said.
For what I did not say it was you who lent me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not answer what I said and as all the right-wing people demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I would also like to quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count uranium extraction and construction and if you do not count the greenhouse gas water vapour of less effect than the CO2 it is true to recall two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant starts with water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "South Asian giant..."!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I'm not surprised, most Indian people who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it's a good sign of your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a Pandora's box full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Kolkata's Athletico taking 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India spends on IPL cricket and now on football, how could we ever compete with our "noisy neighbors..."
The low cost launcher race pays for cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect occurs only with a helium that is too cold.
So maybe we're not in a design flaw, we're in a implementation flaw...
Unlike arianespace, which is a private company, it seems that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for the satellites in frigates who know...
This is all the more unfortunate as many media clockwork on the only titles of articles - and many readers hold only those titles.
All in all, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Completely agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly calls into question the project when it is only a pitcher problem.
