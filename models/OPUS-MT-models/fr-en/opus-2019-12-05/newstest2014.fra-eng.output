Spectacular "wingsuit" jump over Bogota
Athlete Jhonathan Florez jumped on Thursday from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed 160 km / h above the famous Monserrate Sanctuary, located more than 3,000 metres above sea level, where many badauds had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While planners in the U.S. highway system find it difficult to find the money to repair decaying highway infrastructure, many see a solution in the form of a small black box that binds over your car's dashboard.
The aircraft, which records all miles travelled by a motorist and transmits the information to government officials, is at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to redesign the outdated financing system for major American roads.
The generally uninteresting sector of the planning of the major axes suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to press for the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and eventually the road you travel on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses concern about the protection of privacy.
And while the members of Congress cannot agree whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking at how, over the next decade, they can move on to a system that allows drivers to pay according to the number of miles travelled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS surveillance system, for an experimental ride.
This is truly indispensable for our nation.
"It's not like we have the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Managing Director of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles travelled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be some change in the way we pay these taxes.
The technology is there to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed with the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars can travel more miles with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the last 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
"The gas tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State had recently installed tracers on 500 cars to test a mile payment system.
"It turns out to be the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious state laws on global warming.
But Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Speaker of the House of Representatives' Transport Committee, said he also considered it to be the most viable alternative in the long term.
The reason foundation's supporters of the free market also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay for the mile.
"It's not just a tax swinging into a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Politics at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. secretaries of transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move towards payment by mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have involved approximately 10,000 cars.
But the Speaker of the House killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to travel many miles every day to get to their work or to the city.
However, several States and major cities are making progress on their part.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state kilometric fees instead of fuel taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is testing a limited number of trucks.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in states along the east coast of the United States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their cars with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their every move.
"Concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, who leads the strategic performance management in Nevada's Department of Transportation.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into full localization devices."
There is no need to build a huge and bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people's day-to-day whereabouts.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car runs, but without knowing the exact location and time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to use a small California startup called True Mileage.
Initially, the company did not aim to assist motorists who pay taxes to states.
It sought to break into the emerging auto insurance market, in which drivers would pay according to their mileage.
But the devices it tests have liked the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, downloaded periodically by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't record their speed and locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much cheaper ways and much less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering motorists different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a flat rate based on the average number of miles travelled by all residents of the state.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transport officials are seeking to develop a tax system that would also be equipped to pay parking costs, provide "driving payment" insurance, and create a real-time speed data set from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic congestion.
"Motorists would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said an urban development document.
However, some transport planners are wondering whether the whole debate on payment per mile is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay area, officials say Congress could very simply manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles and others whose vehicles do not consume much petrol, so that everyone pays their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgery when you simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, Director of Legislation and Public Affairs at the Commission.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: four new listeners
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
Starting from The Next Day, released in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the Web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie left everyone in Panton.
On his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he said that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dates from 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be relied upon to make the pop scene shine.
A feast for his fans
Not tired of surprises, David Bowie had more than one trick in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke planned to republish this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional songs compared to the original album: the three songs of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces both each of the discs, but also the accessories supplied with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own impressions, a booklet with lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new title, Atomic, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very forward and a rock electricity skilfully mastered.
New ones already listening
But atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-sided: a disturbing intro before a bright cavalcade that gradually slows down to give way to a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a little reference to Elton John's Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddness, next door, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again refers to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
Guitar riffs, captivating, make you want to leave Earth.
Bowie has fun playing chameleon with these titles: in turn informant, man aboard a rocket, potential Martian...
He conceals and reveals at the same time, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
It is not surprising that he has a mask in his hand in the photograph of the L'Invitation au Voyage campaign, by the Louis Vuitton brand, whose new face he embodies.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from 10 November.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that injured soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before they returned to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson assured that prior to their release, members of the army were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All injured soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life, and none are released until they are ready, he said.
Critics accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured members - who do not meet the army's "universality of service" requirement that personnel be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by La Presse canadienne, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a Reservist from London, Ontario, with post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the military despite his request to stay for another year to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who said before a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed out before he was ready because he did not meet the rule of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said in an interview with La Presse canadienne on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way I could stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of major fighting in Afghanistan, the army has been struggling to determine what latitude it can give to injured soldiers who want to remain in the ranks, but who are not capable of fighting.
Under current rules, seriously injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for overseas deployments, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted to Parliament last year indicate that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Liberal veteran spokesperson Jim Karygiannis called for the reinstatement of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while NDP Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney puts on tablets to launch a animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to focus on tablets on its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its app for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on Disney's channels is only scheduled for 2014, details the release of its Disney Junior division.
The cartoon, intended for children between the ages of 2 and 7, tells of the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she makes order rule with a magic lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interacting with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice President of Digital Products at Disney / ABC Television Group, quoted in the press release.
This type of experience is part of Disney's efforts to "extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms," he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under 2 have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under 8, compared to 10% and 38% respectively two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistle-blower of the US intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers on their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter that the Member presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts was obviously positive, my Government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalise political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
In the context of the complaint filed by the United States Department of Justice, he is charged with espionage and theft of State property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany has been severely tested by complaints that the NSA has tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Member of Parliament who heads the parliamentary group overseeing the foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States," it should be taken advantage of.
Mr Ströbele, German Green MP, published a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele stated that, according to counsel for the former NSA consultant, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden was to testify in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, the Member said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained" campaign of persecution that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior officials - including in the United States - felt that the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance was of public benefit.
The letter provides an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately Netflix video-on-demand service via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's subsidiary indicated on Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary tests of the beta version of the platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to highlight more user-friendly interfaces and more options," said Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet in an interview.
Cogeco Cable follows suit with its competitors, such as Bell, even though Cogeco's subsidiary does not yet have a specific date for this new platform.
"We need to adapt and change or resist change and fail," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our clients currently do not have access to.
The Rogers telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which have not been cited, could be resolved.
In the United States, the popular video service says it is in discussions with some major cable companies to make its service available via their broadcast platforms.
The CEO of Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper Government at its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite television providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for pay-per-view services.
"It's been about two-and-a-half years since we said that forcing consumers to buy large bundles of channels is not working," said Mr. Audet.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to some interesting recommendations.
"There will have to be some kind of new frame of reference from these discussions to define our new Canadian cultural policy with respect to television," Cogeco p.-d.g. said.
The CRTC has been consulting with the public since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the results side, Cogeco reported a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82 ¢per share.
This is a decrease from last year's net profit of $44.9 million, or 83 ¢per share.
The Montréal-based company explains this decline by depreciation costs associated with new acquisitions.
Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based Atlantic Broadband cable company for $1.36 billion in 2012.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that had failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Entreprises, an Internet provider based in Vancouver, for $526 million.
Cogeco's revenues grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to 504.7 million.
The current fiscal year is $1.8 billion.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 ¢per share, down from the 45.7 million, or 93 ¢per share, of the same period last year.
However, Cogeco Cable's revenues increased by 45% to 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for fiscal year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers is increasing 5546.
Mr. Audet is not concerned that the number of clients will fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with very strong competition.
From horse to beef products
Horsemeat was detected in cans of beef products, sold by two small British low-priced distribution brands, today announced the agency responsible for food hygiene.
Routine testing revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained 1-5% horse DNA.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," explained the UK agency.
A scandal about the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to reviews by the European Commission, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four early Friday on Highway 131 in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist travelling north in Saint-Félix-de-Valois lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of both vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic was back to normal around 6: 00 on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in its announcement on Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them to the descent of the aircraft.
The new carry-on baggage charges are for bags stored in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier stated that it would charge $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers paid only once at the boarding gate.
Frontier's spokesperson, Kate O'Malley, indicated that the $100 was intended to encourage travellers to pay the fees in advance.
"We don't want to charge that price," she explained.
Airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges put as much as they could in the carry-on baggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no room in these compartments.
These fees are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer things on board.
O'Malley stated that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It is a matter of making Frontier's most loyal customers understand that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline site will not have to pay.
For example, a passenger in queue at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in queue could have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's site and check-in procedures are changing to ensure that passengers are aware of these charges before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's carry-on baggage charges will not be applied until summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often fuss about baggage and other expenses, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are significant and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people at Wall Street see the addition of baggage charges as a sign that airlines are charging enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss.
However, many of them did not pay for baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. applied the first hand baggage charges three years ago, and low-cost Allegiant followed later.
The only other company imposing such charges is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant with airlines Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the surcharge charges.
In a December 2011 report, he estimated Spirit's carry-on baggage costs to be worth $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently travelled on Spirit and wondered what he was going to find at the boarding gate as passengers discovered the company's unusual hand baggage charges.
"I've never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire career," he said.
I was expecting to see teeth squeaking and a fight popping at the door.
The aircraft was full, he added, "the passengers got on board at the speed of lightning."
Frontier also does like Spirit and charges $2 for coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or juice can take the open can with them, and those who take coffee can be served free of charge.
She will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for carry-on baggage when passengers do not purchase their tickets directly from the airline is his final effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Airlines pay online travel vendors like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of using an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it started offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut the miles bonus by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would save 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly from Frontier.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in her hometown, Denver, but her business is shrinking and she loses money.
Revenues fell by 9% and its flying capacity declined by almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic attempted to redress Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA questions an "internal error" and not hackers for the breakdown of its site
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the breakdown of its public site for a few hours, not hackers as some had claimed online.
"NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update," the espionage agency indicated in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial of service attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had broken down for at least 6 hours, and some users are still unable to access the site.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not at all" compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesperson explained.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed to be responsible for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactic is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly ultra-secret NSA, a time known as the "No Such Agency," has found itself under the spotlight and strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its extensive national and overseas communications monitoring programs - which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former disused NSA consultant, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has led to much speculation that tonight's incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville Hotel closed on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to developers who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees down.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and individual employees were met to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," says Delta Hotels Regional Director of Labour Relations, Felix Bisson.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
Either he was reinvesting in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Either he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," says Paul Arsenault, holder of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totalling nearly 600 rooms will be launched in two years' time.
For Titan's CEO, "Goodyear Amiens' purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the sponge with fracas in January for the partial take-over of the Goodyear site of Amiens-Nord promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American pneumatician Titan, now declares himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 jobs in the factory.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister for Productive Recovery, had already announced it on Monday 21 October.
After giving up the project to purchase the plant in January, you are back today.
You had made violent attacks and insults, talking about "so-called workers," who "work three hours" a day, "crazy unions," targeting the CGT.
We don't understand that volte-face.
Is that to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt anyone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment too.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicapped France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I have no prejudice about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But with a proper price and skilled workers, it's worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered employees a good severance payment, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine Titan buying Goodyear's closed factory.
Therefore, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country in the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
He wants to keep the Amiens factory with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from the current 1,200 or so employees in Goodyear.
So Mr. Montebourg needs an engagement from Titan before he tries to get the CGT to sit at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to enter into an agreement on severance benefits for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the plant.
Mr Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister was 333.
I know he'd like a four-year warranty.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on severance benefits.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide job life guarantees when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg can get CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan to buy the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier's profit is falling, while aircraft deliveries and orders are falling
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and aircraft deliveries during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Train division.
Nor did Bombardier, based in Montreal, provide flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before September.
After the initial flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it only flew three times, and the question arose as to whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to expectations and stock prices declined by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst with the National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday from "overperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential for stock market growth in the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the decrease in aircraft deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to customers.
We believe Bombardier will record new controls for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
However, the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft has so far been modest at 177. It appears that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airline aircraft.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 firm orders before the first aircraft comes into commercial service.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was progressing according to schedule.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," said Mr. Beaudoin at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft's shutdown time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We had decided to proceed with a first flight and to schedule an update period, and that is what we did.
This will occur throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company said.
Yet analysts are sceptical that the first customer can fly a CSeries aircraft only 12 months after its inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that it is in the process of evaluating the entry-into-service schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowness in flight testing - although apparently consistent with Bombardier's internal schedule - reinforces our view that entry into service will be delayed in the first quarter of 2015," said Mr. Doerksen.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit dropped to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, one year earlier.
The adjusted share result remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues declined slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a 10 cents per share result and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer in the world reported that it had delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders have dropped to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 before.
The backlog in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion as at September 30, unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
"In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our expectations, but the small number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing," said Mr. Beaudoin.
Aeronautics revenues declined by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest railway manufacturer in the world, reported that this division's revenues had increased by almost 11% to $2.1 billion.
The Transport Division's order book totalled $32.6 billion as at September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have been affected by enforcement problems with a few large contracts.
Management announced that further guidance would be provided during the fourth quarter.
Bombardier's share price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, Chief Financial Officer of Google Inc, would sit on the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to C $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third largest aeronautical manufacturer in the world and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a 10% decrease in its quarterly profit.
Two 23-year-old and 27-year-old speleologists have been missing in a chasm under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned on Friday from the Spéléo secours de l'Isère.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one agerri à la pratique and the other non, had left underground on Thursday at around 9: 30 p.m. in order to cross the Dent de Crolles, located on the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We had no news of them since then, said the same source.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5: 00 in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, technical advisor to the Speleo rescue in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on site
Some 20 relief workers, ten civilians who were members of the French Spéléo secours, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but uninjured."
They got lost in the network, returned to their footsteps while waiting for the rescue, said the prefecture.
Renourished, they should emerge from the cavity with the help of the paramedics in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
On Thursday, the German journalists' union invited its members to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using Google and Yahoo's search engines and messaging until further notice," she said in a press release.
She considered the Washington Post's information, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) had collected mass of information by infiltrating international networks that allowed the two companies to synchronize their servers, to be "scandalous."
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union claiming 38,000 members.
Repainted lights: MP asks for resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project of Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relieving" the posts of traffic lights in Brussels is not pleasing to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport today launched a test project in the centre of Brussels, which consists of repainting 16 columns of traffic lights in the region in the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity."
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, at an estimated cost of around EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark," according to Brussels deputy Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of the "flamdisation" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content to spend the money of the Brussels people madly in operations of relieving the signalling posts in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his operations of flamdisation of the Capital," Mr. De Bock protests in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally painted the Brussels posts herself in dark-blue yellow-black.
According to the Member, there is now "no longer any difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels."
The Brussels people deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD & V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse from Flanders.
"As a reminder, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of Brussels!," concludes Mr. De Bock.
the portico of Pont-de-Buis disassembled
The eco-tax portico of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of the tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national road was diverted as a result.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finistère on Wednesday, was taken by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
This is the last of the three eco-tax portals in the Finistère department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory shop for Google Glass
An online shop, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected glasses.
This allows them to acquire a headphone, a charger or a storage case.
This boutique, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to buy a protective cover made of micro-fibres or an intraatrial earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget him or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep "dating him."
There is no recipe, no instructions to pass the wall of the invisible and find his own.
Then signs appeared.
The first time was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a gentle wake-up in the middle of the night to watch his watch that never leaves me, put on the night table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting fight against cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found his empty body, cracked up on that hospital bed with cracked sheets.
Similarly, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the thin glow of the candles that framed his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Little by little, by small, diurnal or nocturnal appearances, a little timid, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she regained her place in the landscape of my thought, which believed in mourning.
And then she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had not lost my mother's person in any way, but simply a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnated that person, during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had completed her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and complete.
This detour of the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved people never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out," he says.
I've always been told that.
I never believed him at the time.
I had a rough relationship with him until he got old, sick.
Now I wasn't afraid of him, and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I was hurt...
He talked to me, constantly encouraged me, he lived in my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It lasted a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged and advised.
I don't know who said that dead people are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are gone, but I feel them all the time.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to it: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I dream about them all the time, maybe not every night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only, there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes some dreams carry me on the contrary and are part of my history, and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
The day before my ultrasound, when I had to know my baby's sex, I dreamt that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and rejoicing that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he was sharing with joy what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I enjoyed sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in recounting this common memory lived after his death.
Five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year earlier, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is the shock his disappearance caused to the young bachelor I was at the time.
Nevertheless, I realized my mourning quite quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, to the point of making it a master's degree in a large school, have not been, with hindsight, harmless choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are always present, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same is true of my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and right-of-mind of the one who was a fervent believer.
From now on, I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I see his eyes lying on me.
My mother passed away 19 years ago now.
Dead after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: misunderstanding, anger, pain, crying that goes on alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed the pain.
There was nothing but the lack, the unanswered emptiness, the need for her, to entrust me, to reassure me in the depths of her gentleness.
Yet she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her worried eyes landing on me, I see the circles that make her look heavy, the wrinkles around her lips that the cigarettes dig, the folds that mark the forehead on days of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer when they were 43.
We can feel his protection all the time, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually relearned to smile, and pronouncing his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the hollow of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little reached.
We feel worn and protected in difficult times, the recession of time makes us realize how much she was conductor and we try to stay in the way she had charted us.
If a being loved you very much, absence cannot take it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, the loved one becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008, from asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted on the basis of what he thought or liked.
I couldn't see her burial and three weeks after her death, I was giving birth to a little boy.
If I have my beliefs sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are in line with his vision.
I have had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in the opposite direction, I don't sleep in it and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, he will always be my reference.
It was kind of like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
Anyway, he's here every day.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It's almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 and our son was 6.
The immense pain that then invaded me has, of course, diminished, but it is still close to me.
Very often it "arrives" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to see that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I told him no, he answered "I'm going down" but in such a real voice that I woke up in a burst, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I always live in the same house, and often I feel watched and turn around to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I talk to him.
In all the rooms I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and where his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since he left, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am sociable with a responsible profession, I laugh and sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have many friends, but my heart and my soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the deadliest month since April 2008.
On Friday, Baghdad published official figures: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the US President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We don't tell the world to stand by and support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said this Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread as well.
And what happens when a terrorist virus lives? It spreads.
Noury al-Maliki spoke at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution established by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were waving signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with assistance.
Cocainoman lawyer who informed a drug sponsor of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years' imprisonment by the Liverpool Assize Court
A large defence lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to the crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug-related activities after having compromised himself because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "major case," was arrested at his home in 2011 following police listening operations directed to Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous trial in connection with drug trafficking.
Police officers spotted Sarborough, 32, dropping off three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while attending a bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawful information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized £1.5 million of heroin and cocaine, as well as over £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, provided information to criminals because he feared that his addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Assize Court, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Solicitors law firm located in Blackburn, fell into disgrace after being convicted on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer's fall occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing drugs, 60% pure, under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was in regular telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and on her credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but denied using cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because it was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken.
During interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that clients sometimes called him at home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that he was calling major actors in the drug trade, some of whom he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
The prosecutor Anne Whyte said: "If anyone should know that the law should not be violated, he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with individual clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will no doubt be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But that went far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored it.
He got too close to some clients, particularly Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said: "Mr. Ditta has gone from a criminal lawyer to a criminal himself as soon as he started to obtain drugs from criminal organizations."
His addiction to cocaine has compromised him forever and has made him vulnerable to the ulterior thoughts of the leading members of organized criminal groups who entrusted him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the varnish of his profession.
The serious organized crime unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation into Mr. Ditta, who was convicted of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now obstructing justice, demonstrating his commitment to prosecuting criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Another 35 persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his website, Ditta organized a question and answer session on himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what motivated him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage again in December
Detroit News reports that the soul queen will perform on December 21 at the Sound Board of the MotorCity Casino Hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the illness from which she was suffering, the famous interpreter of Respect told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult."
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of its Christmas lights
420 motifs, 2.2 kilometers of seaside covered with a light coat: one could close the hot blow in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice, which, unlike many municipalities, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by traders' associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses leds.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10: 00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to the local police, at least two people were injured.
He is said to be an employee of the United States Transportation Safety Authority (TSA) and the gunman.
The incident reportedly occurred at Terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travellers and staff rushed to the exits or on the tarmac.
Soon the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is being interrupted.
Classical singing for teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful in the previous season.
Through five saynets imagined and interpreted by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humour, teenagers are allowed to tame the classical song.
In addition to this show, the Society of Lyric Art of the Kingdom will return with its Lyric Destinations, a formula that now makes room filled with the Pulperia of Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving local artists the chance to show what they are capable of.
To these activities was added the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the help of the soprano colorature Marie-Ève Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, alongside the artistic dimension, and it helped the not-for-profit organization produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as an air of the bat.
Without giving any precise figures, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of yesterday's press meeting in Chicoutimi to be reassuring.
Despite the precarious nature of so many cultural institutions, the future is looking well, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
"The finances are afloat and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a stage that we will be going through in seven years," said the administrator.
"I would even say beyond that," added Executive Director Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six counts, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan was accused of hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons with dangerous intent, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the officers involved and their ability to defuse the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Paquet by way of a press release.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and is due to appear in court on Friday.
New application for a class action against the Saint Croix brothers
A new application for class action was filed against the brothers of St. Croix, concerning sexual assaults which were allegedly carried out this time at the Saint Joseph Oratory and in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The request is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J.," who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher, Brother Soumis, and then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Saint Joseph Oratory, where he served as a mass and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was for only three institutions, and when the regulations were announced, many people told us: "I was in such a place, can I register?," says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The special feature of the class action that has just been filed is that it allows for the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been committed by members of the congregation of St. Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Holy Cross brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since several of the institutions concerned closed in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which are a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse to be committed against children," that they "exercised moral, religious and psychological coercion on the victims," that they "knew of the sexual abuse perpetrated and nevertheless stifled them," and that they "knowingly and consciously chose to ignore the problem."
The latter charges are based, among other things, on letters written by the lawyer for the Saint Croix brothers, Mr. Émile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Saint Croix who publicly denounced the abuses.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage is the hearing of the merits.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of St. Croix had agreed to settle the matter amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
Important fire in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
Relief calls were made at approximately 1: 00 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire in the basement of an Indian kitchen restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
The 30 firefighters who were dispatched to the site took almost an hour to master the fire.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said the Chief of Operations of the Montreal Fire Safety Service, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived at the scene.
There were no injuries, but close to 20 dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be accommodated temporarily, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical help dying at the Palliative Care Congress
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, held this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favour of the principle of the bill on medical assistance in dying in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, as well as being able to stay at home, very few would like to end their lives, according to a spokesperson from the Canadian Hospice Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The President of the Réseau des soins palliatives du Québec also rejects the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences for future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she deplores.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice-president of the Palliative Care Homes Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be unnecessary anyway.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Hospice Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is disorienting the public about the vocation of palliative care.
He did not believe that Ontario would follow suit.
For her part, Liberal Member of Parliament for Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the notion of end-of-life needs to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press disgraces controversial media law
"This is a frightening country and it is legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?," the newspaper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," explained Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of Capital Group - owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent news radio stations and websites.
He said that the new media court "will always be biased because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would undermine Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians," he added.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media." The Standard, for its part, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and quashed the bill calling it "draconian."
The adoption of the bill comes at the same time as a package of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media provoked the authorities' anger by broadcasting images of video surveillance cameras on which troops deployed at the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury shopping centre.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by convening two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a lifting of shields in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists of up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "deleted" or of being denied official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single fine is enough to paralyse most FM stations."
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animated blogosphere."
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do what they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist at The Nation, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
"Left to themselves, politicians would bankrupt the country and take us back to hunting and gathering."
Kenyan legislators have been the target of the people's anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Wages Commission and re-established their soft wages of about 532,000 shillings per tax-exempt month - which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused a stir to the management of the Hôpital de la Cité-de-la-Santé in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the Pharmacy Department found itself seriously understaffed.
Almost 30 per cent of the staff needed were missing, making this financial year "very difficult," according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
Troubleshooting was not used, Ms. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the facility have been rationalized or reduced to level, while things are getting better.
We certainly worked hard to interest our young people [pharmacy residents] so that they could come and stay here.
There's a combination of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this difficult period, 2013-2014 looks much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain students have borne fruit, as the four students currently residing in Laval have also decided to remain employed with the CSSS.
Now it's much better, said the pharmacist.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
It will therefore fill in our departures last year.
Growing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as that experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a young environment and we employ a lot of young women, so with the pregnancies, we almost always drive at three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
In the past year, we've had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists who are available to do replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old supermodel doesn't start his movie career by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), the erotic memories of a quadragenarian addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's resemblance to her eldest is striking: a twig silhouette, a diaphane complexion and Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste of risk: the one who had not hesitated to pose naked on ice paper will appear in situations much more sulfurous on large screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac raised the temperature on the Web: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it is the star; below, the lining.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, via Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing her actresses into their last tranches, always for the better.
Stacy Martin's not done getting her to talk.
Narbonne RMC room evacuated Thursday night
Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and warned the firefighters of a suspicious smell.
About 70 people left the session.
The people were examined and a complete recognition of the room gave nothing.
Bad joke against a tear-gas background?
Or involuntary incident?
It is still that the director of the cinema has played the precautionary principle and the safety of its customers to the fullest.
The room was ventilated and everything came to order.
The cinema was able to regain its rights and the customers were able to regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She's trying to import two kilos of cocaine into pumpkins.
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to bring in two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was when the passenger's luggage was examined that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed in three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) office, which took over from this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border services officers at Montréal-Trudeau airport have made 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border services officers in the Quebec region made a total of 1,653 drug seizures.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese Army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A shipment of SA-8 short-range ground-to-air missiles was reportedly targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF air raid on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances roughly identical to the one that took place on 5 July: at the time, it was also an anonymous American official who confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont surface-to-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials did not hide their anger at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine approaches bankruptcy
The credit rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the ability of the former Soviet Republic, which has been in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt notes go to "B-," falling into the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative outlook, with S & P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be lowered again in a year's time.
"It is increasingly less likely that the government's strategy will guarantee enough foreign exchange to meet its high external financing needs," says the US agency.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and anticipates that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, are collapsing, and the agency is increasingly considering devaluation to be likely, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to pay its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tension with its Russian neighbour, furious at Kiev's desire to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public in the wake of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its still relatively modest debt has exploded in recent years and S & P estimates it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has for months been calling for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 had granted it a credit of $15.3 billion and has so far released only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new instalments until the country adopts unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
After another unsuccessful mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "the large external financing needs" were "a vulnerability," while noting "signs of economic improvement."
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud of the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect an improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled for 2015, says the expert interviewed at AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S & P also notes the "uncertainty" linked to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the liberation of the opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative consequences in the short and medium term related to Russia's reaction," explained S & P, who fears "trade restrictions" from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for one quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that should a free trade area be established between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls for imported goods.
United States green light for the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday that they had received no objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus approaching the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Group announced today the expiry of the time limit for the examination of the previously announced merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announced both groups in a press release.
They indicate that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the operation to be carried out.
"The merger is also subject to further regulatory approvals and the approval of the shareholders of both groups," they add.
Congolese Army Chases M23 Rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units would chase the M23 rebels to their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be beaten after being driven out of the localities in the north-east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which it had controlled since the beginning of the insurgency 20 months ago.
"We're going to sue the M23 and bust it wherever it's hiding because it's criminals," said Colonel Olivier Hamuli, FARDC spokesman to Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize themselves because they have been tormenting the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, told RFI that these military setbacks would not change his demands at the peace talks.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, resumed Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Clashes are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last town in the hands of insurgents to have fallen this week, and in the vicinity of Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion began in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the escape of the government garrison and the passivity of the Monusco peacekeepers.
The fall of Goma has led the UN Mission in the DRC, the largest in the world in terms of numbers, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawite and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC headquarters was restructured and the army moved to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is now unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to be coming to an end," says a Congolese affairs expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historic - it would be the first time that the Kinshasa government has succeeded in beating a major insurrection.
This would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed groups allied with Rwanda would be present in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.
United Nations experts accuse Rwanda, which denies it fiercely, of militarily supporting the M23, originally made up of former Congolese soldiers who had been mutilated.
British diplomacy leader William Hague invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to exercise restraint, a spokesman for the Foreign Office announced.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals following the shells that had fallen into Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entry of FARDC soldiers.
"We lived a year with the M23 and it seemed unimaginable to us to be one day released by the army," one resident of this neighbouring locality of Uganda testifies.
"We have lived in terror (of the M23), we are traumatized," added this man.
The tests carried out by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus were negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date."
On Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of having been reached, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second largest oil company in the United States, reported on Friday a decline in its quarterly profit due to a decrease in its refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group's objectives.
Its third quarter net income decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters relied on an average per-share profit of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company targets 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Much of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual capital expenditures have increased by $7 billion over two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities declined slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the sector as a whole.
For example, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil reported a declining net profit on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Transportation of schoolchildren: the complaint found admissible
Since the beginning of the school year, the Sherbrooke Region School Board (SSRB) has charged a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who receive school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," says Ms. Lefèvre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to mediation and requested additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk to each other, talk to each other and find solutions," says Lefèvre.
The Commission scolaire de la Région-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not wish to comment.
The organization has only indicated that mediation is part of the process in a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergency rooms of the Hôtel-Dieu
In the face of the frond over several months led by some of the staff and several trade unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "postpone the schedule for the implementation of the project, and in particular the date for the closure of the emergencies which will not be able to take place on 4 November."
An official request made "to take no risk on the handling of emergencies in Paris early in the winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign within a few months of the municipalities.
Despite ministerial instructions, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although in the APPP the term "transformation" or "change in continuity" is preferred.
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual visits to the Hotel-Dieu's emergency room will all have been instructed to take about 30 serious cases a day to the emergency rooms of other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the Hôtel-Dieu, emergency interns will leave room for five general medical interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the current month.
"The Hotel-Dieu emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4," says Loïc Capron, president of the medical board of establishment (CME) of the APPP, who supports the management project.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by the firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical director of the new Hôtel-Dieu.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he tempered, arguing the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will stay on site, he also said.
But it is up to the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are happening gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on 4 November, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or he was lied to," deplores emergency doctor Gerald Kierzek.
He was removed from his position as head of SMUR in early July for leading the fight against the reorganization project, and he defined himself as a "whistle-blower" in the face of a "cynical" decision taken by "the medico-administrative technostructure."
"They are emptying and suffocating emergencies that were renovated less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
However, they are regularly congested.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours waiting at the emergency room in Lariboisière.
At the ARS, it is argued that 30 patients "dispatched" at several sites are not likely to represent "avalanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also have been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APPP are defending the "new hospital model" that has been in operation since 7 October and is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners should also be involved in the establishment of an "ambulatory care facility."
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose themselves," wonders Gerald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression."
This is going to happen just like Level 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going to go where there's the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take any action by Monday, we will change the ratchet, warns Christophe Prudhomme, emergency doctor and member of the CGT Santé.
We are going to be even more present in the municipal campaign and we are going to think about presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, UMP advisor from Paris and elected from the 4th district, clearly announced that "even if the UMP in Paris were for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hôtel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we returned to the responsibilities."
Anne Hidalgo, candidate PS, recalled again Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, it would mark its clear disagreement, says Bruno Julliard, its spokesperson.
Even if the restructuring of the Hôtel-Dieu has its legitimacy in substance, we cannot admit it without an acceptable pattern of postponement to other hospitals.
Obama puts an end to wiretaps against the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to its wiretaps on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, says an American official on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to regain hands in the NSA's wiretapping case after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that IMF and World Bank surveillance by the intelligence agency has been mentioned since the start of the scandal.
When asked about this, an official from the US administration replied: "The US does not conduct electronic surveillance of World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington."
Speaking anonymously, the official did not indicate whether such monitoring had been put in place in the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had given orders to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the wiretaps at UN Headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Committee approved Thursday a strengthening of controls over government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data that intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and has imposed a five-year limit on the retention of this information.
UN welcomes new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations will start working now on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were set up 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in highlighting the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it is now time to "go beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs)," he added.
These SDGs will build on progress made under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate entrusted to me by Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals that build on the success of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing at the same time as conflicts erupt between powerful personalities
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique's founding president, tearing them down, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to sing peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, Managing Director of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the words "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the Independence Square of the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks there have been almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo, the worst clashes since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-run Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not relapse into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The challenge is considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government was responsible for the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala Province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on 17 October.
Attacks on the former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group leader, and Fernando Mazanga, the Renamo spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames the Renamo for triggering conflict, and accuses it of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
On Wednesday, Mr. Guebuza told AFP, the French news agency, that Mr. Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wanted to use "all the forces he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government."
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But there was growing concern after Mr. Mazanga said that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the utmost seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease the tensions fuelled by a series of conflicts this year.
"It's two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and Mozambique specialist.
None of them knows how to negotiate well and none of them is prepared to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by the Renamo has been declining steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which was created by a former member of the Renamo, is expected to obtain more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza - who is expected to withdraw at the end of his second term next year - wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
It is not clear what the Renamo's capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive flash attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the clashes took place in Sofala province, which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was unable to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has reinforced the frustration of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the people responsible for the country's future are the government and the president, and that it is up to the president to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protester, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "lifestyle models," says the author.
Thor's Legend could show that "brutal force does not weigh against subtle cunning," while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be "far too violent, far too scandalous and in some cases far too obscene to be taught at school," Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America," he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are "openly didactic" means that the children "get off completely," the messages being "sublimated" in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult writer for adults and an adult writer for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or finished well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and what we don't say.
One combatant from Hamas' armed wing was killed this evening and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, it was reported from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between Palestinian territory and Israel when they were fired from shells by an Israeli armored.
NSA espionage: the United States has "gone too far," Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in espionage, acknowledged Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Washington confession in full controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time an American government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in the NSA's interception of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I grant it to you, as the President has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that it does not happen again in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London in which he participated since Washington on Thursday 31 October via video link.
In his rebroadcast speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of US diplomacy provided a long justification for intelligence and information gathering practices through the necessary fight against terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Referring to the attacks of 11 September 2001, the Madrid attacks of March 2004 and the London attacks of July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had since thwarted many plans for attacks, through interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have effectively prevented aircraft from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered, because we were able to be aware of these projects," argued the head of American diplomacy.
And, John Kerry told Europeans, "I assure you that innocent people have not been deceived in this process."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already had to speak on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and that he was re-examining these practices so that no one would feel wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans has continued to grow this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA was intercepting data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the program called "MUSCULAR," and conducted with the UK counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from optical fibres used by Internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in January alone - ranging from metadata on e-mails, text elements, audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google denied any connection to these practices.
Over the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain and Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US President was not aware of such tapping, Barack Obama refused to speak about it, citing national security.
On the other hand, the boss of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied him that his intelligence agency had captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services who allegedly seized the communications, before supplying them to the NSA.
This would involve "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not be Europe at all, said General Alexander.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has convened the Australian Ambassador, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans in a vast international espionage network that has also aroused China's anger.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the club of Ligue 1 in a press release.
The PSG, the championship leader ahead of Monaco in contrast to goals, released the list of players selected for this game of the 12th day, without including the 32-year-old attacker.
The press release simply states that he is "injured," without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the deceased
The crematorium of Father Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased crematized in his establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris City Hall, will attend, and will then explain at a press conference her funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funeral, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study carried out on 6 and 7 September with 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a relative, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, only 15% choose cremation.
In his book La Mort en ash, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, stresses the "violence" of cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence done to the loved body," which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which would "accompany the phases of mourning."
There is also "symbolic violence," which is due to the "erasing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly experienced in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book PPrivoiser la mort.
It has been tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to tame it.
For François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, a ceremony as worthy as the one to which he would be entitled with an burial is to be arranged for the deceased.
Ipsos' annual survey shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their loved ones, whether religious (53%) or civil (24%).
From now on, 73% of those who have chosen a cremation wish to hold a ceremony.
66% of atheists or non-believers also want it.
Crematoriums have adapted to these changes in society.
"For the past decade or so, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the delivery of ashes," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the establishments now offer ceremonial masters, who perform the following ritual in the presence of the body: to welcome the assembly, to appoint the deceased, to link him to others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This has been the case with Father Lachaise's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremonial masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of Father Lachaise has organized, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which he invites the families of the people who were crematised in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast online to those unable to travel.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the rehousing for rats turns into a polemic
Earlier this week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the Office of the Land of the South Habitat, proposed, on an exceptional and temporary basis, to relocate the couple and his three children in a new T4.
Yet the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, says Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats have always been in the cities.
The destabilization company makes two passages a year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats don't puff in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, the products of denaturation are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, one is not going to kill a child.
"We didn't invite rats to our house," defends the father of the family who left his house to settle at the hotel.
We are soon without money and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange finishes in decrease of 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended in decline on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating has been affected by the decline of the dollar against the yen, detrimental to export values and the warning of Sony's annual result on Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony dropped more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house plagued by flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out Friday noon in Old Quebec was quickly brought under control.
More than 30 firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-storey house located behind the courtyard of the Séminaire de Québec.
All the tenants were absent during the fire.
The fire was brought under control one hour after the arrival of the firefighters, many of whom intervened.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw smoke.
"So the alarms followed each other, because it took some backup to attack the building, because it's buildings stuck here," explained France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec firefighters.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, in the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued over the years, until it was taken over more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Carolines' stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with over 60 shows presented in small clubs and major theatres.
"Most of the headers emerged at Carolines, and were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to continue working with them.
This year's event will feature the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes," a comedy and music evening for veterans at Madison Square Garden, which will include Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year's festival have gone through non-traditional circuits, for example by presenting shows on small television channels, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel ("The League" on the theme of the fantasy football joyfully lascif of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the show "Saturday Night Live" and was part of the cast of the series "Parks and Recreation," but she is better known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Kroll and Slate, along with other young singular actors (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, ironic advocate of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attraction factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up actor, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg."
The meeting takes place at the City Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and say, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here."
Oil prices continue to fall and are approaching $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about the size of stocks offset a report showing that China's power-intensive manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell from 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it down 5.8% for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The US Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show an increase in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been experienced in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a reference for international crude already used by US refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
Tackling the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal reinstated in Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This judgement means that a law passed in July in that State, which largely jeopardizes the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
The decision of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice GIVs will have to have a "privilege of admission" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his / her status as a health-care member of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment.
The advocates of the IVG argue that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of one third of state clinics because these clinics have not been able to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be deprived of access to these facilities.
On Monday, a trial judge had held on the eve of the entry into force of the Act that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, asked the Court of Appeal to overturn the trial judgement that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star achieved a strong return to audiences, with 1.3 million viewers behind their television station, or 5.6% of the audience share.
But was the show at the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates appeared at the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the bad Sinclair, the perché André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have actually scored in this first bonus.
As every year, the first audition shows bring together a wide selection of budding singers, for better and sometimes for worse.
Now, on Twitter, we want show, emotion, originality, music...
Luckily, a few of them found their way there.
Many of them tried the New Star, and sometimes even went to the end.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of successful singers are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make them laugh.
Court blocks decision on NYPD control and search policy
A Federal Court of Appeal blocked on Thursday the decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's screening and search program and desecrated it from the file.
The United States Court of Appeal (Second Circuit) indicated that the decision of Judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and question citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments concerning the request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge must be removed from the file because she breached the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the Court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their monitoring and search program.
It has appointed an external controller to oversee changes, including policy, training and supervisory reform, and has ordered a pilot program to test body-mounted cameras in neighbourhoods with the highest number of controls.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of those who are rejected after police checks.
The hearing of the City's appeal is scheduled to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of monitoring and searching have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of recorded controls increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 controls that mainly concerned black and Hispanic men.
In 2004, four men, all from minorities, brought legal proceedings and became collective action.
Proponents of changes in NYPD's monitoring and search program say they will end unfair practices, allow for more effective and trusted police forces, and can change the way police departments use politics.
Opponents say that these changes would undermine the morale of the police without reducing crime, would be a waste of money and would not solve the wider problem of police forces under pressure after the number of police officers has been drastically reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not putting an end to the constitutional control and search practices, but that she was reforming the way the NYPD was implementing its controls.
Tenants have to vote because each of them pays on average $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes in tax to the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each dwelling.
We are obliged to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us that they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We can't afford $100,000 fireworks, $4 million to $5 million land in case...
Go and vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entered the 500 m2 of the Elysean kitchens as a clerk after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the ranks until he became chief nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande, through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday sites, and fed an incalculable number of great people of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he did not break until today, at the time of retirement, at the age of 60.
The man with an open face, a loose skull and intellectual goggles, born on October 24, 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, holds a pastry CAP.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I passed from one castle to the other!," ironises Bernard Vauffie, who knows not only the manners of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
"It is always the Head of State or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Mrs. Chirac was a little more involved, she came straight to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchen of the Elysée!
It is not disagreeable to the heads of state who had a relative indifference to the earthly foods, "they are all greedy," Bernard Vauffice nicely denounced.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had suppressed the cheese, the plates returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like."
The current head of state, who regained the kilos lost before the presidential campaign, has "no request for a specific regime."
Bernard Vauffice also remembers the pressure on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at the Elysée: he has to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour."
The night before is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand if there were mistakes.
The now former chef of the kitchen of the Elysée, who had a drink Tuesday evening with his team, his family and friends, leaves with a pinch in the heart. "François Hollande came to greet me."
He said praise.
"His human side came out," he says.
The chief will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been at the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was plagued by flames in Old Quebec Friday noon.
The four-unit building, located at 15 Hébert Street, was alarmed by three fire alarms.
The fire broke out in the front, but rose on all three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said that the rapid response of firefighters has prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where the buildings are constructed in close proximity.
The burning house housed four houses, but no tenants were on site at the time of the fire.
The damage was limited, even if the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have ruled out the theory of a criminal act.
Wall Street Wolf: exit of the second trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is embodied by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will disappoint you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "Long Island Stock Exchange Broker, who refuses to work with the authorities on a large corruption case on Wall Street."
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, the man chains parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excesses of any kind are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have recovered the magic that had united them on Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long installation.
It appears that the film finally lasts 2h45.
In the hall on December 25, he will be able to take part in the race for the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
The former editor of News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used "telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a bogus tip on an affair involving the then Minister of the Interior, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated in the Old Bailey Court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his "pretty special advisor."
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack into Pawlby's voice mail and "plant permanently in front of her door," but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
"The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of people's homes hoping to surprise them, he is the kind of man to like to present history to people to see what they say," Edis said.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate the issues: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first?
Does he know about phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say, "Of course we do."
Rumours about an affair involving Clarke were taken up first by NotW's editorial office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Miss Pawlby, said that she had been told, "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A tape, on which hacked voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found seizures on the private investigator's computer that related to Ms. Pawlby and her sister in a "Projects" file.
During the time that the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup oversaw Miss Pawlby's actions.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I would really like to talk to Charles about."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he was attending the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having engaged in telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, in the midst of violence
The US President was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of help from the United States to fight the biggest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq had its deadliest month in five and a half years in October, according to figures published by the Iraqi authorities on Friday, 1 November.
964 people died in violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police officers and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations had even a higher toll, with 979 dead and 1,902 injured.
Such violence is becoming increasingly deadly despite reinforced security measures and large-scale military operations launched for months by the Shia-dominated government of Nouri Al Maliki.
The total number of deaths in October was the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of United States troops, the level of violence raised fears of a new conflagration, while neighbouring Syria was plagued by a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot dead in the streets or even in their homes, and the security forces are also the targets of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who claims to be politically marginalized and the target of unjust arrests, has contributed to this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, further violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five car bombs north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a group affiliated with Al-Qaida (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is the focus of talks in the United States by Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end the military engagement in that country, had put forward an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has increased the number of meetings with the executive and elected representatives of the Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a "third world war" against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But they also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, who attributed him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policy."
They also demanded that Barack Obama make Nouri Al Maliki understand that "Iran's pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship."
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
On Friday, the Chinese head of internal security accused a group of Uighur separatists from Xinjiang of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people in Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, ran into the crowd in the famous Chinese capital square, a symbol of the murderous repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau responsible for internal security issues, accused the Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkish-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province Eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there driven by independence claims.
"The violent terrorist incident in Beijing was organized and premeditated," Meng told the Hong Kong Phoenix TV channel.
"The behind-the-scenes group was the Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan," he added, "his remarks being taken up by the new China agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he is of Uighur origin and stated that his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained gas-filled containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident resulted in 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement in Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican investigates contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey around the world on how parishes manage sensitive issues such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the instruction to obtain as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to hold next year.
The news was reported on Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper from the United States.
A spokesman for the Conference of Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide the appropriate way to survey parishioners.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
Democratic Republic of the Congo: Army Attacks Last Rebellion's Foot · Global Voices
The irreducible M23, some hundreds of combatants, were cut to almost 2000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities located approximately 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night," told AFP a resident of Jomba, reached by phone at about 12: 30, and according to which a girl was shot in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a little," he added, "it seems that the FARDC armed forces of the DRC have pushed the rebels a little."
According to this witness who wanted to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "sweep operation."
It was very clearly heard behind him crackles fed with small arms.
From Bunagana, the political fief and last strong spot of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the fighting has entered "a final phase," as FARDC has "surrounded the positions of the residual M23 to dislodge them."
Since Friday's resumption of clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it has provided critical intelligence, observation and planning support to government troops.
At the end of the afternoon, dozens of soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, climbed towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, soldiers with civilian assistance loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to take over another machine shelling M23 positions on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called again on Wednesday night for the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" or be disarmed "by force," but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been arguing since December with no results yet.
On the spot, the M23 political leaders hope to reach an agreement.
"We have concluded the talks, only the Ugandan mediation has yet to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-Chairman of the M23 delegation, without this information being confirmed immediately on the government side.
The M23 was born of a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala refute.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and its subsoil is full of coveted mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the movement back to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which had begun in the morning, reversed in the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the military told us to retreat," said AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by his nine children, including an infant on his back.
It seems like the shots are getting closer to the population.
At the beginning of the evening, dozens of people crossed the border, some with mattresses on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical, this beast of stage
Classical, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, sung and danced productions take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found its voice.
It is a revolution: French-style music is asserted as a successful genre.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the rock opera, most attempts would get bogged down in ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables bore the auréole of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at the Châtelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles as successful tubes.
The first, this Christmas, resumes its excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the following the world creation of "Un Américain à Paris."
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" may well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other scenes, musical performances such as "1789," "lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are all about success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comedies musicales" and lecturer at the Théâtre du Châtelet, analyses the reasons for such a hard-won success.
How do French musicals evolve?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical performances" that evolve at the discretion of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a real story like in 1789, the lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year leap back on the pretext that you can serve anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
After that, we have the musicals with the sumptuous productions of the Châtelet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularises Anglo-Saxon musicals of variety by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to break through.
But ongoing projects such as "Rent," "The Spider Woman Kiss" or "Spring Awakening" have difficulty being funded.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in one season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the cradle of the musical, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these trades in many schools.
There are many jobs between regional theatres, touring, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The pool of talent is as significant as the number of positions to be filled.
Why are tours in the provinces so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre for adults and not for young adults.
Music shows fill this gap.
These are the same young people who love reality television and what it produces as ephemeral stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance that these young girls and often their entire family are excited.
The Facebook pages of these shows are skilfully maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a provincial Zenith.
The mayonnaise went up to Paris and tasted by the provinces.
The show is designed to enter all the major theatres of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious casualty in an accident with a ghost driver in the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5: 30 a.m. on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, towards Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9: 00 a.m., at the scene of the accident, until the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation did not cause much congestion because the accident occurred at the Hoeilaart exit.
The traffic could therefore have been diverted by this exit / entry of the ring.
A child seriously injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old was seriously injured as a result of an accident at an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is still in hospital.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the "Pirates of the Caribbean" attraction.
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: Army prepares for a new assault
Children play on a carbonized armoured that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in eastern DRC.
On Friday, the Congolese army was preparing for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in eastern DRC.
The aim is to dislodge the M23 from the hills that overlook Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took Bugina Hill, which overlooks Mbuzi Hill.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
Only Runyonyi hill will be left.
"Chanzu's is not very strategic," said the AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku plans to go to Bunagana on Saturday.
A political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this town is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred irreducible M23 have been cut to almost 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the nearby town of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting on Thursday throughout the day indicated that the situation had been "calm since this morning."
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting of the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were injured, including one seriously evacuated by FARDC, who added the AFP witness.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not reported any loss of life.
NSA revelations increase corporate paranoia about state surveillance
On a beautiful day in late August, a German police helicopter overflew the British Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, at low altitude.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation sparked an exchange between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of the US intelligence services, again stressed in September that the US does not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits."
But since Edward Snowden, the whistle-blowing consultant, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible wealth of information about the secrets of US surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on his word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian petroleum company Petrobras and had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever aroused corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that the telephone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between US intelligence and business transparent.
I believe that it is conceivable that these data should be used for their mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, representing German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the US is as high a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by the consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents unveiled by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has passed on trade secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capacity and believe that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and reopen them slowly...
"This is not the right way," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we should not let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Everything but the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of US intelligence agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations have been a shock to some companies who previously believed that China was the biggest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, as European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, about 10% of non-US members have abandoned their plans to use a U.S. cloud storage service provider after the revelations about the U.S. Prism data exploration program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says, "Our clients are asking us today a question they didn't ask us a year ago: where are my data kept and can you guarantee me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders say that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There have always been.
"This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Managing Director of BASF's chemical company.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business managers are generally reluctant to reveal the preventive measures they have put in place, should this leave the advantage to an opponent.
Large companies have long been marking the message that it is at least imprudent to collect a free USB drive during a trade show or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the Audi car manufacturer, says that the collection of mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The German BfV advises its managers to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when travelling abroad because of the risk of infringing the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their trade secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV warns in a report.
The United States alerted its own companies to the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The US National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), conducted in February, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, who were second-degree guilty of hacking economic intelligence behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company considered that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former French Director of Internal Intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies."
The parents of a Georgian teenager, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgian teenager, whose body was found in a wrestling mat rolled up in the gymnasium of his high school, think their son was murdered, said the family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 trapped in a carpet pressed standing behind the stands of his high school gymnasium.
The Lowndes County sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson had died in unusual circumstances, but the family of the 17-year-old boy disputed these findings.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com. "This is not the case.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
"They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as the common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions were made solely for the purpose of covering the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a briefcase and they were returned to them in a dead bag," he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, pointing out that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow up on the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis for an official investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died of "positional asphyxiation."
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are still a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he finds evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Office representative was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge from South Georgia ordered the authorities to hand over all the video surveillance recordings that the investigators had examined.
The adolescent's parents stated that they hoped that the video images would contain clues about the circumstances of his death.
CDC publishes advice on child allergies to schools
On Wednesday, the American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies in school.
This is the first set of guidelines that the U.S. government has published, as the number of school-aged children with food allergies has risen sharply.
One in 20 children in the United States is now suffering from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize faculty and staff to food allergies in children, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have a stock of epinephrine - the EpiPen brand self-injector being the most commonly used - to be able to react quickly in the event of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated the regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
The kids can say, "I feel like something's piercing my tongue," "I feel like I have a hair on my tongue" or "I have tingling on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on intelligence
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which, on the one hand, is offended in public by convoking the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, it is forbidden to fly over the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumour of Edward Snowden's presence on his ship?
In my view, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When François Hollande calls Barack Obama or when foreign minister Laurent Fabius summons the US ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is that of the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Is it not surprising to read in the columns of the world a few weeks apart the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and a condemnation of the listening of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral positioning, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks raises the veil of American diplomacy's analysis of political and other issues around the world, we consider that, in the light of American power, this is an important light.
When we describe American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to indignation us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA concerning terrorist operations against our interests?
Can we deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The fact that the United States, as well as France, has been putting in place very powerful technological interception tools for the last ten years has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
In this area, France and the United States, in particular, have established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on a quasi-daily basis, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas of Miranshah was reported to the French through the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit whole blocks of data on the Sahel region to the American services, and in return - as has already been said - the Americans can give information to the French about other parts of the world.
So the substantive issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or the right of countries to acquire interception tools, but the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly in parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope which must be theirs, and ultimately the question of infringements of freedoms.
What is the United States really at risk of? a deterioration of its image?
We may denounce them, but I do not see how they can be punished.
The risk to the Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have strained.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in the light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US suppliers subject to US law, and thus to the NSA's control.
Last but not least, the vast movement of revelations by media around the world, which is helping to initiate a debate on intelligence surveillance practices that have so far been virtually non-existent, could push legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sexual organs.
The male or female sex of newborns will no longer be rigidly attributed to birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to enter "indeterminate" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the Act was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions about sexual reassignment surgery for their infants, and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I'm neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, bruised and swallowed.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children born every year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, with intersex being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorders, a generic term for people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering surgery, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification issues, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea."
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
"Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children," he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex persons as different from transsexual or transgender persons, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being either.
These characteristics may be self-evident in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, hair, chest and stature), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conforming gender now have special camps for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to include male, female or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "neutral" after winning her appeal trial that allows her to keep an "unspecified" sex for life.
German passports will have a third designation alongside M or F - X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition to remove "gender theory" from school books.
The American site Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "since the world is dragged into a new reign where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown."
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer to have a sex attributed to the babies at birth.
"The role of a parent is stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the sex of your child," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely ten years ago, the medical community considered the genre as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But from now on, many people question the ethical basis of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors may be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel about sexual reassignment when he or she grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," said Drescher.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was initiated by Dr. John Money of Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malleable.
He recognized the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental signals - the way parents raise a child - interact with a child's genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John / Joan," his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut off during a gagged circumcision to castrate him entirely, also removing his testicles, and to raise him like a girl.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it was not," said Drescher.
At about 15 years of age, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But when he was 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors "always repeat this pattern."
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations said "[they] are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn't really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
When he was 18, he had a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical records.
What he found horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for its sexual organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, taking a testosterone treatment and getting his breasts removed.
Surgery made it sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based non-profit organization Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law "invites labelling and stigmatization."
"Many activists are concerned that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an" indeterminate "sex," she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we didn't see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that his organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized as third-sex."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal genre," she added.
German law concerns the attribution of sex at birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a disorder of sexual development and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that German law will "take responsibility" for parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29 years old, Katie is married and interns in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogates.
"The law allows parents a degree of flexibility to avoid hasty decisions," Baratz said.
This gives them time to do certain tests and to understand them, and a delay before entering "masculine" or "feminine."
So everything is fine - you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for surgery that's irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and reduces the sense of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do the right thing," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he / she feels the most comfortable - and that is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself or herself.
Letta confident in the longevity of his government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta judges that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right in the ruling coalition as the Senate's vote approaches to remove Silvio Berlusconi from its mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the centre-left leader said he "firmly intends" to continue governing with his coalition until the next parliamentary elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian Parliament will meet later this month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council who was convicted of tax evasion in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where it has more opponents than supporters, declares his removal.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last its refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of fire.
Fire fighters called at the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call alleging "multiple injuries."
"The security forces are on the scene," says the airport on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people evacuated to ambulances.
"There was a shooting," said AFP a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second one carried on a wheelchair.
The incident took place at approximately 9: 30 a.m. local (12: 30 p.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that temples 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was not in a position to confirm in the immediate future whether any of his employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli army kills Hamas member in Gaza
Israeli tank fire killed a Hamas Islamist Palestinian activist on Thursday and seriously wounded another in the southern Gaza Strip, it was reported from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this area, as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli army merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel called a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and announced to be discovered in mid October.
Report: Obama's campaign seen as dropping Biden for Hillary Clinton
The advisors closest to President Barack Obama have considered, in the utmost secrecy, replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This is the most significant event in Mark Halperin's and John Heilemann's long-awaited 2012 campaign book, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times got a copy of the book to be published and told on Thursday night that the president's close collaborators had conducted "extensive group work and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes were dwindling.
According to Times Political Correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary General Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice President by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely kept within the Chicago Field HQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisors to the president - including Daley, Obama's former campaign leader Jim Messina, and former White House councillors David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew that the change was under consideration.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their "close personal ties," before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "did not significantly improve Obama's chances of success."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and it was one of them," Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president was not in shape, and so we were like, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley described the review as "concerted," Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had invested a great deal in finding out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
"Campaigns don't spend much money on surveys and focus groups unless they seriously consider taking action," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama was aware that his team was looking into the replacement.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of the possible reorganization.
Although Daley said he didn't think the president "knew" about the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not definitively answer the question of whether the political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's removal from the presidential list was under consideration.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world's first ice fluorescent jellyfish-based ice.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He had the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the shiny protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to shine when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice-cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said: "It's something incredible but we're still in the early stages of production, and 2 g of this stuff costs about £200."
The protein we use in ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to shine.
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the brightness of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every ball costs me about £140.
But she tastes pretty good!
The experimental Charlie company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But its next creation is even more ambitious.
He added, "I'd really like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is inherently impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think I will find a way to do that.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, revealed Thursday his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for the inhabitants of the town of Springs, where the couple had a house.
The artist died last Sunday, at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning, as he looked at the trees and performed the famous 21st tai chi movement, with his hands as a musician who split the air," writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was master tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we're city dwellers, this is our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will pass on to many the great joy of living that he had," she adds.
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: Figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I became more pinger.
In the last two years, I have not distributed a single candy and I will certainly not do it any more this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallant sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans - 158 million of them in fact - will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, disguises and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party is trends.
The disguises are expected to account for $1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inanimate sexy objects are furious.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizza, burgers and carrots.
As far as men are concerned, I expect to see many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that Daft Punk's space men will be included in our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most popular disguises are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with staying traditional.
We disguised our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, the Americans are going to spend $330 million in animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of curious dogs dressed as hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, you don't gobble.
The Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents about 272 million kg of Hershey bars, lollipops, Milk Dudes, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million kids who go hunting candy in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell ourselves stories, consume 41 million kg of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candy is the only thing you don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg is sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of maize.
It's a mystery I haven't figured out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 haunted houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million in recipes, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these amazing pictures of you pissing on your Facebook friends that you can't remove and on which a guy you like leaves a comment of the "pretty head."
I mean, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree - it's something we've been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby pumpkin trend" only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these pumpkins and didn't have to sit in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that gently wilt on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you're looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg pumpkin.
Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal "bad bank" with 38 billion pounds (€45 billion) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to ease its relations with London and speed up its re-privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of dubious assets in its balance sheet from 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleaned it up within three years.
RBS also stated that it would enter an additional allowance for write-offs of £4 billion to £4.5 billion over the quarter, a writing related to the establishment of the cantonment structure.
RBS also pointed out that this internal restructuring would liberalise from £10 billion to £11 billion in capital, thereby strengthening its lending capacity.
The bank and London pointed out that the "bad bank" could draw a line on the past, as the government had in particular been accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
"We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90% of assets that make up a really good bank and build a large bank for customers and the UK," said new Managing Director Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces its sponsorship of a series of rallies
The interior features 6-point seat and harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Bowler CEO Drew Bowler said: "The rally enthusiasts who join Bowler have changed."
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try out different forms of rally in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the vehicle of the Defender Challenge - the championship will be really exciting. "
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15 m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a quarry
Ruby, a cracker, escaped after a non-serious road accident.
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
The firefighters took a reminder down the cliff to get the bitch back and save her from a certain death.
A puppy had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to safely recover him while he was perched 15 m above the ground on the unstable projection of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cracker, escaped after a road accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being saved in a career on Wednesday.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They desperately searched for their lost bitch and made a call to social media sites after she disappeared in the career following a non-serious accident.
Around 2: 15 p.m. Wednesday, a person with sharp eyesight walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, trapped 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and came down as a reminder to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical rescue specialist Andy Clayton said: "She was in a precarious situation."
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't move at all during the rescue - she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after that.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical rescue specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby was very lucky to get away with it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; his general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified watching the rescue."
I didn't think she was up there first.
It was surprising to have him back in his arms.
The veterinarian said if she had been too exhausted and fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely wonderful.
Mr. Alderson, of Keyley, added, "We were afraid that she would fall, but she didn't move."
The firemen were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never hit on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview during an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, "He hit on me when I was 18."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and he was very kind."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger stated that he "categorically denied making advances to Katy Perry."
The representative added, "Maybe she's confusing him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers making an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism," landed at the top of the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question a Turkmen Islamic movement
"Behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and Western Asia," said the head of the Chinese security agencies to a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website on Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CCP), spoke in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has designated a particular organization after Monday's attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, a border of several Central Asian countries, rushed their cars loaded with gas cans against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that killed two people and injured 40.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of Eastern Turkestan, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 as a member organization of Al-Qaeda.
This movement is often referred to by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The break-up of Europe gives the Scots the choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are warned that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And now we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along the wall of Hadrian.
While it is true that Strathclyde's paper indicated the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not in the headlines (and should be expected).
Nor has anyone said that the EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, continuous non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants to get from the Scots.
It is therefore a story that is not one.
And a story so ancient that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the bobble that "independence means passport control" more than 40 years ago.
Yet an interesting point has been forgotten in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow Europe's instructions, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely at a standstill.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or advocate the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and arrived from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections in September and removed the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the carcano on national economies through accession to the single currency, has led many to believe that the Europe Project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments with excessive budget deficits - this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has put favourable exchange rates on its members for German exporters - which German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with a problem of intrinsic productivity vis-à-vis Germany.
The only remedy is to cut wages and public expenditure - encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise linked to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels - which are a reason for subsidizing French and German energy companies at consumer's expense - European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a debilitating cost disadvantage, as we have seen in Grangemouth.
Not all wage freezes in the world will prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, the revolt is raging, particularly in France, one of the EU's leading leaders.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a means of controlling Germany and putting Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy struggling.
As a result, the extreme right-wing party of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the votes - a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split of the right will automatically favour the left.
What is Marine Le Pen doing with its new popularity among the French white working class?
It wants to use next year's European elections to create a single anti-European currency block in the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties were to be good at these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
That is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be more like a "Europe of Nations (sovereign)" free privileged by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope that it will look soft in the United States.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending Berlin and Brussels for a walk.
I believe that Scotland could come to terms with a freer Europe agreement if we keep our own motto.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of Nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is - and it should be noted - the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the dark cuts proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Chancellor, Alistair Darling, and the subsequent Conservative / Liberal-Democratic coalition.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Aging earlier
Studies show that African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
Physical changes don't mean puberty is imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter's pubic breasts and hair start to grow at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a child endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young American women and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents - in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast budding, hair under the arms and in the pubic zone and body odours, appear earlier in girls.
But there has been only a slight increase in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, compared to 12 years three quarters in 1970.
"Once the chest has begun to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test for how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows or stops - it's something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster progression may justify testing by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumours or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the onset of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of bones that can slow growth and small size in adulthood.
Drug and hormonal treatment recommendations are based on child age, developmental rate, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psycho-social aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medication but recognizes that "controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioural problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others."
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will deal with hygiene issues," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had her first period when she was 10.
Even if there were signs and we talked about the rules, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public's attention about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9 years, which linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty age earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything, from economic conditions to climate, to genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic zone, the trend towards genuine early puberty is not as pronounced as among girls.
Other physicians attending the PAA conference emphasized the complexity of the topic.
Acne and pubic hair are common, even in infants and toddlers.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a child endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will react well in general.
Girls with early puberty need to be reassured that even when it happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
The tribute to the folk of the Coen brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography was just the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémathèque française, had taken the Palme d'or in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Without being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their hands on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33 years old, but also on the planetary pop star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and live songs, Oscar Isaac reveals himself as an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left the rich attire of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the Magnificent" for less glamorous clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the jumper unfolded with a machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" recounts over a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't break through and gets angry with the whole world.
He accepts retrospectively the replacements with the feet raised in the studios.
Without accommodation, he toured the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what interested us: a mix of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a career driver but integrates, with self-destructive behavior," declared to the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and awards in Cannes.
While Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music filmmakers built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich village, this neighborhood of New York called to become "the epicentre of the development of folk music that would generate international stars," as the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk writes.
The film then took on documentary style, from the unsold 33T dusty music label inhabited by an old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers performed.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a funny character who goes through the film all the time: a beautiful red cat with a crackling look, a makeshift companion of Llewyn Davis.
Asked about how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled "growing up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country."
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is needed to "be considered good," "chance can also start someone's career," and "more and more today."
Like Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise her music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to be caught by anything that can stop us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS," died.
He never knew the word retreat.
In the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died on Thursday at the age of 83, had just published his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin."
In February, the New York Times had described it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theatre of the 198 and 199th opus of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling with a walker.
Before Afghanistan, he had also gone to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, said he ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul," the first in the series, almost half a century ago.
"Probably between 120 and 150 million countries all together," he said last March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment in a building on Avenue Foch just steps from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he cited some of the languages in which SAS's adventures were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Not to mention pirate editions," he added, designating a pile of books on the coffee table between the bronzes or ivories reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with a photo of a young woman with a advantageous chest, carrying a gun or assault rifle.
Inside, his Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a dissilenced Austrian aristocrat and CIA contract agent to pay for the repairs to the family castle, went after all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70's and 80's, and then jihadists from the 90's.
With each book, the same recipe: a great dose of geopolitics and exoticism, some scenes of hard sex, a zest of violence and torture.
"I never pretended to be a literary writer," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went there and returned with real and long investigations."
The father of SAS said "do some kind of geopolitical soap opera."
"I am constantly following my files (Afghanistan, Syria,...) before leaving," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP journalists, diplomats, people from the services I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SAS are often premonition: for example, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command centre killed several senior officials, he told the story in "The Damascus Road."
In "Benghazi's Gods," he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in that city, the cradle of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Conspiracy," a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako," he recounted the 4X4 columns of jihadists who based on the Malian capital.
I am not a devout, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make hypotheses from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my hypotheses come true.
After his travels to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter, "all the pieces of which have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in the pen.
On the walls of his office are AK-47 assault rifles, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly tipped for machism by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organisations, Gérard de Villiers divided these accusations into two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books, but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I am always well received in Africa, where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not of age."
He won't die or retire.
No more than I do.
The airmen are arguing about the width of the seats while large controls are at stake
The dispute between the major aircraft manufacturers over the width of the tourist class seats on long-haul flights is raging, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at the Dubai Air Show which is taking place months ago.
The dispute relates to the width of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers - which are not always the most courted by airlines, but to which the space allocated is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard requiring a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its big American rival Boeing says it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as the aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record of orders at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The manner in which seats will be positioned at the rear of the aircraft - in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats - is essential for the economic performance of the "mini jumbo" segment.
Boeing states that its redesigned "777X" will accommodate 406 people in economy class in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus states that the competing version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in 9-row configurations.
Aeronautics giants often exchange hits on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls directly to the public before the Dubai airshow, where the 777X should take precedence over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, we were able to see what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept that?."
"Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft," said John Leahy, Airbus's commercial manager.
As eating habits change, people grow larger, but seats in aircraft have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's Jumbo 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The size of the 21st century average American is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival clings to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicated that an additional inch in seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus's seat width figures and argues that it is not for manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not depend solely on the width of the seats.
"It's really about bringing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they need to do to carry out their business," said Kent Craver, in charge of passenger satisfaction at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more a matter of having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly an issue that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute lies a race to order aircraft for an estimated amount of at least $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tilt the balance of US and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, seat configuration is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat performance in their latest 20% higher long-haul twin engine models than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The performances announced by Boeing depend in part on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in 9 rows.
The gain in unit costs is small compared to the set-up with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing is doing this so that it can fit more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our products," said Kevin Keniston, Confort Passenger's manager at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that the cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favour of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
"An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus's proposal is motivated by the 777 threat," said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aeroplane vendors who go around the world even take with them a meter to check the competing configurations.
While boasting of offering comfortable aircraft, all manufacturers also offer high density aircraft configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider aisle seats on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of modern large aircraft, the experts say that it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set up a size standard for seats would succeed, but that it could overlook the 777X sales wave.
Oracle shareholders irritated by Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and general manager Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote was not binding but tarnished the image of Larry Ellison, the world's third-largest fortune just overtaken by his boat's victory at the America Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Already last year, Ellison had a negative vote on his pay.
Oracle's boss gave up a $1.2 million bonus for the 2013 fiscal year ended in May due to the group's poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but collected about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the whole of the 2013 lagged year, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5% while the bond exchange price by 27.5%, surpassing the S & P-500 index, which took 24% at the same time.
The new nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine dependence for life.
Further testing is required before starting human testing, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods now available on the market, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begins to produce a steady flow of antibodies.
The antibodies track down all nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from having his nicotine dose.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice that were subsequently given nicotine continued their activity normally.
But mice that had not been vaccinated "were soothing," researchers said, indicating that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently to keep antibody levels high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms liver cells into antibody plants.
Professor Crystal stated that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, children could be given it before they were tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to quit smoking.
"They'll know that if they start smoking again, they won't enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists stated that the results were interesting but indicated that much more research was needed.
Pakistani Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in an American drone strike on Friday in Pakistan, it was learned from the security services.
Hakimullah Mehsud's death has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence, military and activist leaders claimed this time that he had lost his life in this strike in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone shot," said a senior security official.
The previous day, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on a trip to London, had informed the British Government that discussions had begun with Tehran e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labour Minister of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales Minister Joe Tripodi denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to determine whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several state ministers to renew his leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid owned two restaurants and a coffee shop, after their expiry in August 2005, without any tender.
It is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony from Mr. Tripodi's former Deputy Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
In the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government lobbied for a tender for leases.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay's businesses, which contributed approximately $2.5 million per year to the Obeid, were renewed without a call for bids.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tendering.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations presented to the ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid's command at the Department of Fisheries.
"Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of commercial lease policy?," said Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," Mr Tripodi replied.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at least it wasn't about that.
At least certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, says Israeli leader
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirms a military official at Fox News.
The person in charge did not specify the target, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass a "authenticity" test
The Government is currently studying the possibility of introducing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa as it plans to extend enforcement measures.
The test, if adopted, would be applied in accordance with a test to prevent 457 visas from being used for unqualified positions or as a diversion to bring family and friends to Australia.
A government discussion paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia's neighbours.
"The overwhelming statements about" foreigners going back to the bottom of the line "and" jobs for Australians first "are an unpleasant return to the time when unions were calling for a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white people's work had to be protected - and I would not be surprised if some countries in the region saw it as an echo of this historical artifact.
The discussion paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to determine "whether the job offer is genuine in the case where the applicant is a personal relationship or partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsoring undertaking."
Companies may also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some companies, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's horrified 9-year-old son went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death on Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was urgently transferred by the Australian authorities to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the UK Government.
The work done by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
The Baroness Transport Minister Kramer said that the project "would bring the UK together."
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was "excited" about working with the UK government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government increased the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and the improvement of journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for up to three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together."
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a problem of the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unambiguously" support Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said, "High-speed rail has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings Scotland's economic weight to the overall high-speed rail project across Britain.
"We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the British government to explore options for bringing the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will decide together on the next steps."
Rules for the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the US move to relax electronic device regulations.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in "plane" mode.
While passengers can already do so for most of the flight, many find it difficult to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are reviewing the decision that requires U.S. carriers to do significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the announcement but pointed out that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," she said.
The issue is regulated by regulations requiring aircraft operators to ensure continuous safety and passengers to comply with crew safety instructions.
Virgin, who has already told CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to change, but said she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really believe it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft," said a spokesperson.
Qantas stated that it is currently in compliance with the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate intention of changing that," she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in the regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA's decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will be required to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passenger instructions.
"Once an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," said the FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to turn off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under seats or in upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four wounded in a violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a group of about 30 people according to the testimonies gathered...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a fight involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries would be deplorable.
Alerted, the gendarmes went there to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Pledge lenders in Singapore take advantage of middle classes forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga puts a bracelet, ring and pair of gold earrings at a paired lender at Bendemeer's mall in Singapore to pay her daughters' tuition fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator, and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia - where household debt is increasing - that ValueMax, where it made its transaction, has become the third pawnshop to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Paying jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash - $1,300 from Singapore in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga - but it's almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore pawnshops levy an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, pawnshops have the advantage of not asking for a credit check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to pawnshops as families feel the pressure of rising costs of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and low-cost credit fuelled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to bridge the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the growing indebtedness of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia leads the list with 80 per cent of GDP, compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which recently emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are looking to supplement their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have made people quick to pawn their personal belongings to get the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pawned in the city's 200 pawnshops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, the largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its shops in recent months.
The increase is such in the pawnshop sector that ValueMax, shop operator in Bendemeer and 15 other shops like this one in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia - where it already has four shops - but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its general manager.
The company will fund them using 60% of Singapore's $66 million raised this week when it introduced itself to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some reduced-rate lenders have been criticized for their exorbitant interest rates, Ms. Yeah indicates that pairing not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Clients are robbing assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt," she says.
Paying is becoming increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing short-term secured financing.
People who go to pawnshops are also not just those who have financial problems.
The wealthy people of Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pawn gold ingots or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their purchase price in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
"They can be affluent people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses that need cash to get through a difficult road," says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with child pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth minister in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia is charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30 years old, was arrested Friday morning following searches of his home and the office of the National Research Council where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, is deeply saddened by this news.
In a statement, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under 18 years of age or have access to the Internet.
He will appear in Halifax Provincial Court in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before he is driven out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barred from a armband with the swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers having complained to the management of the establishment that called the police, said the store Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked her to leave the store," explained a spokesperson for the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "by the time she arrived, he had already left without any problems," she added.
I was in line when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
People were mouth-fucked.
"You don't go out on the street like this unless you want to get attention," testified a client, Rosina Rusin, 60, at Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, the day of Halloween, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS armband twice a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining "mental problems."
$325 million rescue plan for Tasmanian health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the flickering health care system has strict conditions to ensure that the state government will not waste the funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent steps" to end a crisis caused by an aging island state population, high rates of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding, planned over four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmania's independent MP, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges facing the state," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-emergency surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, particularly in the field of orthopaedic surgery and cataract, will help to catch up.
Funding is also provided for the walk-in clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved external care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems to local hospitals.
"These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania's health care system," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will have to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth money and prepare monthly reports on where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the Crown provides services in the most efficient and effective manner possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count "unless they are followed by real reform to strengthen Tasmania's public health system."
However, he commended the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will go a long way towards removing Tasmania's public health system from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the State Government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse the recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesperson Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is a "makeshift solution."
"The reason we're here is that the state's Labour government has removed $430 million from its health care system," he said on ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that rips out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and pretend it's a good day.
Mr Dutton visited Mrs Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue plan will be spent on extra bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel has a remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous reconstitution of the time, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Taking place in France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faced the limitless cruelty of one Mother Superior deliberately sadistic and became an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never pours into lubricity or sensationalism, and that is the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, says surveillance agency
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gases, said the international chemical weapons monitoring agency on Thursday, while violent clashes were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day ahead of the deadline of
1 November set by the Hague-based organisation ordering Damascus to destroy or "render unusable" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious schedule to destroy Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still needs to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mustard gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made as the fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which, according to experts, houses a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory based in Great Britain.
The group of activists, who are monitoring the evolution of the human balance through a network of activists based in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, an estimated 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad were killed, 18,678 of whom were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Of the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 were opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated this figure since then.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country as a result of the conflict.
Al-Assad troops have been fighting the rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups of the Al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory declared on Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but gave no details.
The fighting has underlined the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they complete their mission to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of a continuing civil war within tight deadlines.
A statement by OPCW, working closely with the United Nations, stated that its team was "now satisfied with having checked - and seen destroyed - all declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling."
It added that "no other inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first phase of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW said that both sites were, according to Syria, "abandoned and... that the elements of the chemical weapons programme they contained had been moved to other declared sites, which were inspected."
At first sight, it was difficult to know whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
"I salute the moral strength and courage you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organisation," said the Director General of Ahmet Uzumcu, in a comment published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shia Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there had been a large explosion on Wednesday at an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence imposed on one of Bali's bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali attacks reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years fleeing as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years on parole.
The 45-year-old man was convicted of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other charges related to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutors applied for life imprisonment, yet they could have asked that the man, called "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in bomb making, be sentenced to death.
The decision revived painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destruction perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators almost 10 years ago.
On the brink of tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"He should be dragged in front of the firing squad," said Ms. Corteen at the PAA.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren, or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded in a van parked outside, exploded just after 11: 00 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a backpack loaded with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he died three times while under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues stated that Patek should have known the same fate as the other three members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist cell responsible for the carnage - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated that intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden to re-establish links between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender," added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he mocked the grief he had caused others.
The verdict was issued on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of crying this year," said Ms. Corteen.
However, Patek may appeal against his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but not make a call with their mobile phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their door-to-door electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music - but not talk on their mobile phone - under the new, long-awaited guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines will be required to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new directives and have updated crew training manuals and aircraft storage rules to ensure compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices in the near future," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not expected to turn them back on until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the captain gives his go-ahead.
Passengers are expected to turn off their aircraft during the descent of the aircraft prior to landing and not turn them back on until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new directives, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground rollover, said the FAA.
Most new airplanes and other aircraft that have been modified to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Association of Professional Flight Attendees, said she was pleased with these changes.
"Once the new policy is implemented safely - and we will work closely with the carriers for this - it will be beneficial to everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like "room guards" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, said the agency.
Passengers will be required to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was widely evicted from an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stored because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority for mobile phones is vested in the Federal Communications Commission and not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were still considered a risk.
"Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to FCC, that they could disrupt mobile telephone relay antennas if they are used on board," said Rosenker.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to examine the problem recommended last month that the government allow for a wider use of personal electronic devices.
Pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there are no valid security reasons for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to turn off their aircraft, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices in 1996 as a result of reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were transporting FM radios, the then high-tech gadget.
New line aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow for wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, said Huerta.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Electronic book readers, for example, only issue minimal transmissions when a page is turned.
But transmissions are stronger when devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is one of those who are pressing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's managers loaded a Kindle e-book reader line plane and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This has given members of the FAA Advisory Committee mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices poses a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers stated that he believed that interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that indicate that aircraft can interfere with aircraft systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to request passengers to turn off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling for common sense arrangements for technologically equipped travellers.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helipad bird from a platform in the North Sea was released into the wild
A bird, rotated after being found exhausted on an oil platform in the North Sea, was released into the wild.
The water rake was mounted on a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was put back on its feet by the Scottish SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This water rale was probably a wintering migrant who came from northern Europe and was caught in the midst of strong winds in the North Sea."
It appears that the exhausted bird was able to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: "He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help."
The water rale was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of bringing businesses together and defining what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, broadly representative of all sizes of companies, sectors and regions in Great Britain.
The findings of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have discovered that the vast majority of companies are now seeking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing as EU states stagnate.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than getting bogged down in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked about specific policy issues - ranging from monopoly regulation to product laws - the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should return to Westminster.
The single market has caused general discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading area - 40% of the large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives to change the treaty and develop a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This conclusion, which can be found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the business world insists on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
The stakes are high - achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain's interests would allow a 16% shift in the vote in favour of maintaining the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, since the euro area is embarking on a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses it means putting a new emphasis on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
The United States with Halloween Colors
In the United States, President Obama did not depart from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife last night, he distributed treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were cancelled due to Hurricane Sandy.
So this year, the party-goers have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the "Greenwich Village" neighbourhood.
Everyone's over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the suit I had planned last year.
We're having fun like crazy, Rhonda adds.
People are happy.
It's good kid, it's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan festival celebrated on the eve of All Saints, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline opens a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom's director.
"A historic event took place today: Construction started in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, Europe's largest large-scale project," said Alexei Miller, Gazprom's Managing Director, in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his Ukrainian counterpart, which transits most of Russian gas destined for Europe, increases the level of risk compared to conventional channels, the Director added.
Miller added that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever."
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project becomes operational in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world's largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily Tahiti News, featuring information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory is 47 km2, with three other small islands nearby.
It has been British since its occupation in 1790 by the mutineers of the Bounty, an episode in the history of the English navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, the majority of the descendants of the mutineers of the Bounty, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Island Council voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, i.e. 836,000 km2, corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
A deputy mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards greater financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, residing in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctuarize the 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port to place military surveillance vessels.
As for France, it must already carry out the very expensive aerial and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the ZEE of French Polynesia, neighbouring Pitcairn.
The FAA relaxed restrictions on the use of electronic gadgets on aircraft - but it will always be prohibited to make calls on mobile phones.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former vice-governor of Jilin Province in northeastern China was sentenced Friday to life imprisonment for corruption.
Excluded from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having hit more than 19 million yuan of bribes, reports official Chinese media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also the President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped companies and managers to obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, said Beijing's first intermediate court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering the phenomenon a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the Head of State promised that justice would be as intransigent with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials have been convicted, including former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest office in the state.
But the government has not expressed any intention to reform the anti-corruption system by, for example, establishing a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two New South Wales YMCA employees were charged with sexual assault against children following allegations against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord at a hearing of the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children in 2011.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA stated that it "had never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization."
General Manager Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education instructor at the YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel for the Commission, that he had knowledge of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate, pointing out that "external controls of the YMCA were carried out and indicated that child safety was a top priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings of four institutions in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities conducted in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that personnel management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they were required to report any violations of child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of 6 years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA had a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's breaches of child safety.
Staff members testified that they had observed certain shortcomings, including the fact that Lord stayed alone with the children, kept them in private, seated them on his knees, told them that he loved them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behaviour, said she found YMCA Caringbah's Children's Services Manager, Jacqui Barnat, who supervised Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time."
The Director General said that he rejected the staff's testimony that they were reluctant to report these deficiencies to their supervisor.
Instead, he said that the friendly relations they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, so they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his view before the New South Wales YMCA Board that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be "reporting" by the staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were made, was made by the YMCA Executive Director for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence, but that it was "overzealous" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA in New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on child sexual abuse, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in the recruitment, monitoring, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to re-become Prime Minister, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various national policies.
Since his departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as Quartet Special Envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: "Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so..."
When many equestrian event experts met in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year Trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first guns, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trotted through the three laps with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparables - which are of the same size - were praised for the presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat cap a little on his side in a casual way to scroll his 2-year-old Toffee pony around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural qualities of dressage for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a present for his third birthday last March and has since trained with his Shetland pony every day.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said, "Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duet."
They presented themselves against and against everyone, but both took the gold cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were crazy about the joy he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been competing in equestrian competitions for over 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air and everyone encouraged and applauded him."
He ran all the length of the track and even though he seemed very small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, he will surely soon participate in the Horse of the Year demonstration - and I'm sure he will do a great performance.
A spokesperson for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony."
They're a good team.
The judges noticed that Fenton and Toffee presented well and how they marched on the runway.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer - Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he looked really good.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "will be reshaped"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page call for the release of a journalist accused of libel will be reshaped, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou has published a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now the New Express is going to undergo a "complete overhaul," said the regulator.
The order of "reshuffle" comes from the Guangdon administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the group Yangcheng Evening News, had published several erroneous articles on the company listed Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The writing of New Express was disorganized," the regulator said in a statement.
He stated that he had decided "to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card."
He also "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that he investigate those responsible at New Express and immediately reorganize the newspaper's management team."
Mr. Chen has written several articles for the New Express about the alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice published a front-page call for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion and the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was chasing after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express published his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to confess, despite a change in the law that was passed earlier this year prohibiting the authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in the harbour.
The radioactive vapour leak detected on one of the two nuclear heaters in the Charles-de-Gaulle in mid-October and while the vessel was at sea, was "safe for sailors," but not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royale has confirmed to us "the unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November," "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, DCNS, a specialist in defence naval, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently operate on the carrier."
They are, among other things, changing a pump on the malfunctioning boiler room.
"Every effort is being made to ensure that the Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013," says DCNS.
And the National Navy certify that "it does not call into question the program of activity of the ship" with nuclear propulsion.
It should be recalled that the Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft carrier was released from a six-month intermediate maintenance period.
He had sailed from Toulon in mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify young fighter pilots.
A "small damage," confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the French fleet's flagship ship.
According to the National Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great deal of discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous re-evaluation of their properties, deluge of taxes, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to finish no longer.
Anyway, siphoning without limit from our pockets.
Millions of squandered dollars could be saved in order to allow a much respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with sumptuary spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: cultural centre deficit, strong subsidy to the Cité de l'Energie, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also distressing to note the expropriation of several properties in order to accommodate a major industry that has never come.
I do, however, give an honourable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a sort of industrial incubator, but at what cost to tax payers?
It is not up to the public to invest in such enterprises, but rather to the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that the fishing and pile lakes will continue to provide the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (major water users) and the large decline in the population, water use has declined significantly throughout the territory.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation of its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a record.
With a gross debt of over $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We have been run for over 40 years by craftsmen with great degrees for the most part and I don't think a sheep farmer is doing any worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The American authorities described the 4 feet by 3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they had ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzagating over a length equivalent to nearly six long football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, making it easy to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs came out unnoticed, said the authorities.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are liable to imprisonment for a term of 10 years to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major crossing discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, challenging drug cartels to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passageway of about 700 yards with railroads from the kitchen of a Tijuana house to two warehouses in San Diego.
British police issue extradition warrant against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that it had issued a "remission notice" against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking that South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a surrender notice against a 40-year-old man who asked him to report to a police station on the date and time of his choice," a spokesperson said.
He continues to violate bail conditions.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after having unveiled more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting against secret information.
How biometrics will invade our lives
Are you done typing passwords to access your smartphone or pay for your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, deputy director general of Morpho, even believes that "the century will be biometric."
Only biometrics will make it possible to ascertain the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a world as transverse and transnational as the Internet.
The privacy organizations confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 alone and in France, the National Commission on Informatics and Freedoms authorised 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone can soon be identified, anywhere and anytime," says Justin Brookman, Consumer Privacy Officer at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, in some, and pessimism, in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will enable new services to be rendered to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people working on concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are illegible," says Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand implies a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - it cannot be captured without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been carried out over the past 20 years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the coloured part of the eye).
With increased sensor accuracy and computer computing capacity required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture's R & D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
"Today, we are conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk with sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyengar, Director of Security Research at Intel Labs.
A unique and infalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," says Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospective Studies at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and expensive.
NEC offers criminal investigation services a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
Biometrics uses are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is the person they claim to be).
So far, the identification concerned the issue of identity documents: biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) must be compared with the information that the state has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person does not attempt to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance to a hotel or shop.
"We get images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who are freely circulating on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, NEC France's business development manager for biometric identification solutions.
Other use: take a photo of a quidam in line in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens, etc.) or logical access (opening a computer).
In addition, more recently, there has been monitoring of attendance.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend who points for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, d'Accenture.
But more and more authentication will also concern transactions, especially those involving devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this act replaces the striking of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by Natural Security in partnership with banks and retail brands: when paying in-store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is planned to last six months.
If it is successful, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French merchants' premises.
Ways to reassure users
There are three ways to make biometrics attractive to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a customer stays in cash for 30 seconds less, it's worth it," explains the manager of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
"The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks itself if one tries to move it," lists Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, in the absence of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know whether these speeches really convince users.
The privacy community continues to be concerned.
"The advances in facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me fear the worst: widespread surveillance," says Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km / h with a hot drink between his legs was inflicted an almond of £1,000
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving at 210 km / h with a hot drink in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to be taken between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the conduct offence without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points removed on his licence resulted in a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also ordered to pay £90 and a victim surcharge of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Consolidated Revenue Fund has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who, in Budget 2012, entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than £2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own property in a corporation rather than in an individual capacity.
The stamp duty already applies to the residential properties of the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, amounting to £708 million over the 2012 / 13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: "With the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of anti-avoidance legislation in this area, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are undertaxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
Prestige real estate - the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market - in the prosperous sector located southwest of London, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has increased by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a rapidly growing "domestic market," with the city's southwest, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) recovering, according to Savills' studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how the movements of a dog's tail are related to his mood.
Previous studies had shown that happy dogs moved their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs moved more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "Everyone knows that in man, the left and right sides of the brain are involved in different ways in stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was happening with other species.
He added that, as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, researchers followed animals watching movies with other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It will certainly not take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We have presented to dogs films containing other dogs - either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor - and we have been able to manipulate the tail movement and present it as going left or right."
When the animals saw a dog without expression stirring the tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog stirring the tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail moving mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog stirring the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said that he did not believe that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, he thinks that dogs know from experience what movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet other dogs repeatedly and you notice that most of the time the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side causes a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, visiting professor at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, "Dogs went more easily to a robot dog when his tail moved to the left than to the right, instead of becoming anxious - the opposite of what appeared in the Italian study."
He indicated that the differences could arise from the fact that the dogs who participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals in the movies or robotic dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs might be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified - and dogs are no exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviours can be recorded, it will certainly not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes move on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert to Glasgow after his singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
Sheffield's band was scheduled to perform on Friday in The Hydro Concert Hall downtown.
However, his laryngitis forced singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to likewise postpone a concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "Following the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and after seeking medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday, November 1."
"Alex Turner suffers from laryngitis and regrets that he cannot perform in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Glasgow Hydro will take place on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience caused.
Please contact the customer service at the ticketing office where you have purchased your tickets for any additional help.
Pope Francis will appoint his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, announced the Vatican on Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest church men placed in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will appoint his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope - that is, it belongs to a group of 120 "cardinals voters."
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops would be raised to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
"Pope Francis decided to communicate his decision to convene the February consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said that by February, the number of cardinals voting will probably have decreased.
He said that a pope usually named as many cardinals as he needed to make the number of cardinals voting up to 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wanted.
Next year's consistory will be important because it will be the first since Pope Francis was elected in March this year, said Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
Cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the Cardinals Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world to examine ways of reforming the church.
Previously, the pope decided on his own.
"From now on, François has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero explained.
He added that it was "quite possible" that François asked the cardinals for advice.
But we have never experienced such a situation - it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was "full of surprises - so we do not know who he will appoint."
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the seat back
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to fix a problem with manually tilted files, according to a Friday statement from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could have a defect in the tilt mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
"If the vehicle is struck by the rear, the head restraint may not adequately protect passengers, thereby increasing the risk of injury," according to the statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models recalled were built between August 1 and September 10.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first US car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickups owners of the defect in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, which slowed the growth in vehicle sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42.660 Silverado pickups and 16.503 Sierra pickups.
GM's share price rose 1.4% to $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks on Thursday morning in Montreal.
The drama occurred at approximately 11: 00 a.m., on Marquette Street, close to the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been taking place there for some time.
A mitoyan foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to recover his tools.
I was driving by and saw the wall crumble with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who remains close to the construction site.
I came in and I went to take off the big bricks that covered him.
We only saw part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is an elderly man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation manoeuvres were attempted by the emergency services, but were unsuccessful.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Occupational Health and Safety Commission was dispatched to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
An Obama Voter's Cry of Despair
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made laudable efforts thwarted by the obstructionism of the Republican Party
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks of drones
The memory of Obama's 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what might have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year medical student at Harvard School of Medicine.
I'm reading a horribly sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during the slack of the second year of medicine and give me hope again.
His name is "The Audacity to Win" and these are the memories of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished my patients' medical reports in the evening and went to bed, this book took me back to the days when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended with an overwhelming victory and news presenters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My comrades cried with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing towards the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favourable opinions.
And then I close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult awakening, it's like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years following the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I imagined.
I credit Obama for great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our army, to the end of the "no seen or known" and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer explain.
I'm on the verge of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the wiretapping of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
She cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans, nor the indictment of whistleblowers who reveal the wrongdoing of the government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, nor the escape of public funding and the overrun of the expenses allowed during the presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the White House's efforts to silence the media are the "most aggressive... since Nixon's administration."
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unsophisticated alternative that did not seem to determine his policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term and freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we had heard for so long.
Yet, while the index of favourable opinions has plunged below 45% this week, it is even more difficult to return to the year 2008 through this book.
He makes me want the many promises that have gone away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses to Clinton at the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Five years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are those of Nathaniel Morris only.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescue, he died during this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest over the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer argues that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who challenged the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, argued this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were willing to benefit personally from these policies.
"He will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying for parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the seat of Sunshine Coast in Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr Palmer put forward the idea of a redesign of the voting system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your details in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6: 30 the next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone doesn't agree?
Nowadays, having a pencil of paper seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission had considered options for electronic voting and had recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, stated that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties "very seriously."
The exercise of public functions is a matter of public service.
"We're not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the New York Wildlife Conservation Society has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off the northern coast of Australia.
Thibaut Bouveroux, Scientific Officer at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Marine Animals and Habitats (OCEAMM), returns for L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Does the discovery of this new humpback dolphin surprise you?
That is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
While species have in the past been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today the development of new tools such as genetics allows us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
It is not impossible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to call into question the classification or membership of a species in a genus, family or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged because of advances in genetics.
Similarly, two closely related morphologically distinct species were distinguished through genetics.
This is the case with the newly identified species.
A decade ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: Pacific humpback dolphins and Atlantic humpback whales.
Recent analyses have identified four species.
Why is this a major discovery as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and hence its genetic variability.
If this population had long been known to researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only there.
Therefore, if there is a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture in the region, we may have to deal with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a species more widespread on Earth.
This loss of genetic resources would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or extirpated based on the number of individuals on Earth, that is, the stock, and the ability to recover from neighbouring stocks.
For the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the new discovered species originated, its stock has automatically become smaller, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This gene mixing limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
The marine environment is the least well known.
We'd rather send robots to Mars, than find out what lives in the Mariana pit, just 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
We spend more money in the search for life on other planets than in marine research, and it is high time that this change.
RBS suspends two traders on the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division from two sources close to the file, again showing that the global regulators' investigation into suspected foreign exchange market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations of the world's largest financial market, where US $5.3 trillion change hands every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of the expansion of the investigation, which echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The ongoing investigation of this case is ongoing and we are cooperating fully with the CFA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had sent folders of emails and instant messages to and from a former trader to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European Head of Currency Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Head of Currency Trading at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, Senior Currency Trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages to and from bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, adding sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it brought an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator, Finma, stated that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the CFA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are examining allegations made about bankers who have agreed to manipulate exchange rates.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicated sources close to the file.
Banks look at instant messages and emails that have been sent for years to find cases of wrongdoing.
The news about these investigations has shaken traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest engines of growth of the trading units of investment banks in recent years, but that has been questioned this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limits the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
One senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between trading management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at low cost."
The news arrived on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had returned a trader working in its fund office negotiated the London Stock Exchange this week after he caused a loss of $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was brought under control," said a representative of Credit Switzerland.
The investigation into Mayor Rob Ford was sloppy, argues a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had got their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby argued that he had never seen an "as sloppy" investigation.
Mr. Ruby said he believed La Presse canadienne that the police had "ignored or minimized" the evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver, Alexander Lisi, 35 years old, and accused him of extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, indicate new court documents.
Mr. Ruby described as "inexplicable" the fact that the police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or taped his phone, arguing that police chief Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and carried out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash described Mr. Ruby's remarks as "an obvious and desperate attempt" to assert himself to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr. Blair stated that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" for filing a criminal charge against the mayor.
European stock exchanges down in mid-session, except London
With the exception of London, the main European stock exchanges are on the decline on Friday at mid-session, driven by some disappointing company news, while Wall-Street is expected to increase.
On the other hand, investors remain cautious as they believe that the U.S. Federal Reserve could undo its policy of quantitative easing earlier than expected.
On the other hand, after the announcement of 0.7% inflation for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spreading among market participants that the European Central Bank (ECB) could relax its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street heralds an opening of rising U.S. shares, after two consecutive retreats.
At the values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, buoyed by the result warning of its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of EuroFirst300, having also published declining results this morning and announced the creation in-house of a "bad bank" with 38 billion more risky assets.
For its part, Vodafone (+ 2.45%) remains at the top of the increases of the EuroFirst300 in response to press information that AT & T is studying a possible OPA.
On the foreign exchange market, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is well underway, as John Hardy, a saxo bank strategist, points out.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week's meeting.
We are anticipating a strong potential for a decline in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues to fall against the US currency and has reached a lower two-week mark at $1.3517.
The same conjectures support the euro area bond market in the opposite direction.
Supreme Court Validates Obama's Health System Reform Act
Great victory for the Obama administration: the US Supreme Court today declared the Obama-ratified health system reform law to be constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act - which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, failing which they would have to pay a fine - and declared it constitutional under the government's tax authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy disagreed.
The Court also validated the remaining 2,700-page sections of the Act and considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered, failing which all federal funding for the program would be lost, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
Proceedings to block the law were initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates in the 2012 presidential election, including nominated candidate Mitt Romney, fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant Tribute to Veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and deceased of all wars.
Sprouts were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by Deputy Mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Palestinian-Israeli engagement on the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured on Thursday evening, 31 October 2013, in a violent clash on the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased functioning on Friday, November 1, after its fuel stocks had been depleted, the Energy Authority of the Palestinian enclave announced.
A local commander of the Ezzedin al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another senior Hamas military officer, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by tank shells during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armoured bulldozer made an incursion of some 100 metres into the territory before withdrawing thereafter.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heroes" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the Al-Qassam heroes who fell defending the territory during an incursion of the Zionist occupier into Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman threatened.
For its part, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities."
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the aim was to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using the tunnel, an Israeli military statement explained.
During the operation, Hamas detonated an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the terrorist tunnel being used for attacks against Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel hit an air military base in north-western Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, reported on Thursday, 31 October, the Al-Arabiya satellite chain.
An American official confirmed an "Israeli strike" but gave no details of the target.
"In the past, the targets were missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he added.
Israeli government officials refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing "exclusive sources" that it did not name, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombardment targeted a cargo of ground-to-air missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon," in reference to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Lattakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents at Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopedias de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and from ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Théâtre Maisonneuve, advances, of profile, fine as a line and clothed in black, a body.
On the screen, Henri Michaux's ink is projected.
The body, a simple trait, takes its shape.
And this form will be the shape of the whole piece: an enfilade of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only with their hands and face uncovered, wait on either side of the playing area, rush when the next drawing appears, embody it, run out.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solos relay, in unison group (a mass that makes solo), in large group of twelve solos where each one executes his sign.
We think of "Glory of the morning," where, as a solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on cartels, posed online in the foreground.
It's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the rhythm always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur takes refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of the poem of Michaux, monocord and monotonous in the scream, and continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to go back.
This long, energetic sound discharge, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hair that crumbles or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
We have the impression that the choreographer, instead of going to meet Michaux's work, has established herself, with her tics.
As a result, the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
The inks of Michaux, like forms of Gestalt, open up a broader and giboyous imagination than dance, which is more porous.
Only the end, in negative, with its dancers chopped by strobe light and white signs in a suddenly black theatre, touches magic.
The audience liked it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedias, after intermission, are richer.
The stage is partly covered in grey, the dancers and a piano are covered with fabrics, like furniture in a abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers turn around to play the scores.
Their touching music clumsiness gives a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duos, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving sets, choirs, writing is less binary.
Some buffoons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, with a red nose, in very polarized male-female loving parades.
The lovers are carnassiers, runners or players.
The gestural, the laughter, and the little cries are deeply transposing the archaic, the grace and the ridicule of the bodies into coitus, of the beings who merge.
But the play takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes superimpose themselves, the dancers cabotinate, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play applause codes, stretch the sauce in a skilfully calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are sweeping, and it is Chouinard's art to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei facing legal proceedings over Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents started an avalanche of patent lawsuits on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company he crowned at the post in the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Assize in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
Patents contain technologies that allow advertising related to search terms on the Internet, indicated the outcome of the trial, which is Google's core business.
It was not possible to reach the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work under Google's Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel's patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, and finally offered $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola's patent library.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in issue during the auction, it violated and continues to violate those patents," stated the trial findings.
Rockstar claims greater damages against Google because it claims that Google's patent violation is stubborn, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defective water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette in a gas leak.
The explosion of a house in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, indicated Friday evening the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert sent to the scene by the prosecutor's office assures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette when there was a leak and gas build-up.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still under way.
The grandmother was shot by the explosion and is seriously burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and companion, was at his side and was burned slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU in Liège, she by helicopter, he by ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who had come down on the scene.
Traumatised, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Safe and sound, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs left intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and tenant of the nearby house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
Crisnée's civil protection department has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi took the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he took the oath of office as president, becoming the first freely elected president and successor to Hosni Mubarak, who was driven out of power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He was sworn in before the Court's 18 black judges whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We aspire to better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life - absolute freedom, true democracy and stability," said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer trained in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as an illegal organization and severely repressed by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the Court to applaud the new president and, in contrast to the presidential feat of the Mubarak years, the traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the busy streets linking the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered the uncharismatic "spare wheel" of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased considerably since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to run as a candidate not only for the Islamists but for all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian President Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in blue suit and red tie, addressing the judges present in the hall decorated with woodwork where he was sworn in.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to Cairo University where he gave his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by a military band that played the national anthem as he put himself in the watchful eye.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The people and the army, hand in hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheatre of the university.
Founded in 1908 and former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a fief of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian regime last year left, and swore to recover the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ex-president who was ousted, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
Shutdown in the USA held back the rise in the car market
The 16-day closure of most federal governments weighed on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, show figures published Friday by manufacturers, with five of the top six performing below expectations.
Detroit's three major manufacturers show double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors has done better than expected.
Analysts expected an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market was estimated to be 15.3 million according to Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley's analyst.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight setback is primarily due to the "government shutdown" and its impact on consumer sentiment in the first half of the month. "
However, GM reported an increase of almost 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
All four brands of the group improved their sales performance compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while consensus was expected to reach 194,301.
For its part, Fiat-controlled Chrysler announced an 11% increase in sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also have below-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, the GM share increased 1.4% at 4: 35 p.m. GMT while Ford gave in 1.1%.
Renault on the stock exchange by Nissan's warning
On Friday, Renault recorded the biggest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced that it had reduced its annual net profit forecast by almost 20%, reports traders.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a redesign of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault action was affected this morning by the "warning."
"This is clearly Nissan's profit warning," says a Paris broker's trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from the Nissan website.
Greece: Two dead in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured on Friday night by gunshots fired by two people on a motorcycle passing in front of a neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party building in the western suburbs of Athens, it was reported from police sources.
The police were not yet in a position to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Anti-terrorist police raided the central avenue of the suburb of Néo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighbourhood.
The incident occurred a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies from Golden Dawn, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against that party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal dismissed
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has been denied his appeal and will be suspended for the next two Champions League matches of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expulsed against the Barça for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish milieu saw its suspension extended to three encounters by the UEFA.
In a press release, his club said he was "very disappointed," considering that his appeal was entirely justified.
Nearly 50,000 households across the province are without electricity shortly after noon on Friday due to strong winds in many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers immersed in the dark, Montérégie with 13,464 and Outaouais with 8642.
The Greater Montreal area also has its share of power outages with nearly 7,000 private households in the metropolitan area and Laval.
You thought travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit projections upwards and expects record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency now expects to realize an underlying profit over the entire fiscal year between $325 million and $340 million before taxes, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12-17% growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million reached in 2011 / 12.
Managing Director Graham Turner stated that Flight Centre had achieved 8% profits in the first half and that the second half had started in earnest, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present have been profitable, and many of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire fiscal year before deducting interest and taxes," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly declining domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre's leisure travel sector performed well while business customers spent less.
Its subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses in the first half of the year when seasonal demand was lower and was expected to earn a profit over the entire year for the third consecutive time.
Flight Centre's stock increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown shots at hotel near Cairo pyramids
This Friday, unknown people opened fire on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo, Egypt, without causing any casualties, as a result of an apparent quarrel with laid-off employees.
The attackers fled, said the spokesman of the Ministry of the Interior, police general Abdel Latif.
This attack comes at a time when Egypt has received virtually no tourists since the army removed Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and is blooding the protests of his supporters.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature classes, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to the present.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be discontinued.
Starting in 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programmes tomorrow - the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
In addition, Ofqual, the Board of Regulators of Examinations, will unveil a redesign of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking this summer, Minister of Education Michael Gove said that there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence," stressing that CSGCs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies show that English schools spend less time on math (116 hours a year, or 3 hours a week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and Singapore students offer about 138 hours per year.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to math, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE of advanced math - as well as the greater emphasis placed on subjects in the international rankings - would likely encourage schools to provide more teaching hours.
The program will focus more on "real world issues," including financial mathematics.
This judgement means that a law passed in July in that State, which largely jeopardizes the right to abortion, will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle to the Muy for Halloween
Miners 9 and 13 years old used to go door-to-door to claim candy on Halloween night.
One of the neighbours of the Muy neighbourhood visited by the children opened the door while holding his shotgun.
The old man, 86 years old, told the gendarmes that he had been afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former Gestapo chief buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of the Second World War without ever being found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte," he assured the daily in great circulation on the basis of archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi regime, would respond to one of the great riddles of the post-war era.
The German secret service, the BND, assured that during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were totally wrong.
"As early as August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Air Ministry by a commando," says Tuchel.
He was wearing "a general uniform."
"In the left inner pocket were his record of service with a photo," he continued.
Bild also publishes a document from the Mitte district town hall in Berlin stating that he was buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The President of the Central Council of the Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, declared himself shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists is buried in a Jewish cemetery is an enormity of bad taste.
"The memory of the victims is grossly trampled," he said.
Heinrich Müller is one of the important personalities of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his orders Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Walking in mud, jungle and crossing rivers to offer free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in villages in Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, barely 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the other 10 heroes, to elect him "CNN Hero of the Year."
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma whose sequelae he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to busy clinics and hospitals to get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5: 00, run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since the death of Dr. Bwelle's father in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
By way of comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians would not be able to pay for the consultation.
Two out of every five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three quarters of the country & apos; s health expenditure is in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy life.
After seeing his father and as many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed more than 700 surgeries free of charge over the past year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And it has established a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which visits rural areas during weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about 30 people, they pile up in vans after they have fixed the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to reach the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn't always follow them.
They have repeatedly had to push vehicles to cross rivers or muddy runways.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle - with his big smile and overflowing energy - is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team begins to receive hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people each time," said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this travelling hospital, various health care services are provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a pair of glasses collected or a free birth certificate - a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team practices simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient rises and goes to the alarm room to leave his or her place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the first hours of Sunday morning.
It's a hectic rhythm, but the village musicians usually help the team stay motivated.
"They're hitting drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working," said Mr. Bwelle.
On Sundays, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgeries free of charge over the past year, and knows that their presence can make all the difference for those they help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and that of my family," the man said.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's sleeping," said Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He is still in hospital or trying to find money for his association so that he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a field learning opportunity they don't have at home.
"We were able to participate in operations to help clean up the blood or pass the instruments on to Dr. Bwelle," said Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you're a medical student in second year.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
"He's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happily by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," added Mr. Bwelle.
And I'm thinking about my dad.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The two France of Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and situate Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but highlighting his weakness for the traverse paths, Sciences-Po, the Hautes Etudes.
Arbiter of the works of others in his office on Gaston-Gallimard Street?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the editor.
Heir to the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the French Academy?
Of course again, but knowing that such a sacrament cannot replace the true holy oil, that of the thesis that has happened.
They gladly recognized him as a great awakener, facilitator and unifying of their work, but pointed out that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of memory," to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The nasty languages could see a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen look and a lot of scholarship, but incurably dilettant.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who thought not to write had much and well written.
The book here should definitely do him justice.
Yet there is once again the temptation of ubiquity, the intellectual vagrancy, the jubilation set to jump as if on foot joined from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects gathered in this book with such a beautiful title bring the embroidery back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the knot that constitutes French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: this is a concern of the times.
A few minutes ago, we were collectively asked to give a definition of this.
But in the peremptory spirit of our then leaders, French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the matter, Jacobinism obliged, was entrusted to the prefects and to the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Pierre Nora hunts is quite different.
He does not stand as the heir of an eternal Francinity, he refuses to define.
A scientist worried about a familiar strangeness, he wanders in a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented with irritating questions.
Why, in a country so sustainably located within its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly mastered, are these dramatic calls for unity heard?
They are only so pressing, suggests Pierre Nora, to counter the disorder created by the discord of French history.
Francs and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignon, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is obviously the one that splits national history in two.
From the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchic and the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the former, but did not succeed in denying it; on the contrary, it was anxious to regain its sacrality, and all the more greedy for unity and indivisibility, since it had cut off its head from the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To make sense of this singularity of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that the American getaway of Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
For America and France have both made a revolution, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American cousinage only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men cluttered with an ancient indigenous regime, and all the more radical.
There a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confided it.
There are founding fathers who are always honoured, and here revolutionary ancestors whose role models are difficult to make, and who have also been killed among themselves.
There is an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, such as mistakes to be made and tests to be repeated.
The France that goes away, the France that comes
Yet there was a time when the French thought they could sew the torn dress of their history, and overcome the curse of number two.
At this third republic, central moment and creator, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: saluting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France obscured modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only one time.
Here it is again in debate, buzzed by a new type of immigration, threatened by the rise of minority claims, absorbed into the European area.
The book thus offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve some surprises.
It found out that the railroad was a casanier.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessive, around the same idea.
The edge walker was located in the centre of the centre.
And he who had laid down, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had evaded the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually have done it.
Certainly in a less stiff, more bursting and more subtle form.
But let us not be mistaken, just as binding.
For far more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
Former hostage in Lebanon: "Return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the hostage defence association "Otages du monde," which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the possibility for the hostages to file a complaint and bring their hostage takers before the International Criminal Court.
The four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb), Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Feret, were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Grâce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to return to the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked 62-year-old Jean-Louis Normandin, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde."
As of the evening of your release, you were on the 8: 00 p.m. set of "Antenne 2."
What are your memories of your release today?
In Beirut, for example.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's dark - Roger Auque.
He says "we're free," but I'm not sure, and he says we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very tense too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They're dropping us off on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel site where the press is present.
Some French are taking us to the French embassy.
It's time for the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night talking to Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arrived there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How was your arrival on French soil?
We're landing at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible hustle and bustle.
And a lot of media.
When I left there were three TV channels.
I'll be right back and there's plenty of them.
The descent from the flight stairs, the reunion with my son and my relatives, my friends, all of this is extremely emotional.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers are taking pictures and following me to my place where I have to do a little police work to keep some of them from getting up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're in a good position to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly in the media.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, pretty complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
The same night, I'm at 8: 00, the next day, too, I'm on TV.
Then start a kind of life rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like a vacation.
How did the medical examinations and the DGSE debriefing go?
I was given a first medical check in Corsica.
The rest was done at the Val-de-Grâce the following days: my return: radios, tests of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on him, remind him if necessary, that we are not left to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me about the hostage takers.
That made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you respond today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what's being said.
The debate on ransom in particular.
Some things annoy me, some less.
I am trying to balance the questions about my past as a hostage with my hat as president of the "Otages du monde" association, which allows me to distance myself, and seems much more interesting to me.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there's a semantics problem.
Hostage-taking should be described as a "political" hostage-taking - most of which is the case - and allow the hostages access to justice, to file complaints and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might have access to justice, too?
A court in The Hague is meant to do that.
Why don't we tell the hostage takers "you've flouted the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, well-founded, legitimate, common sense.
This message is heard, but not listened to, and I am shocked.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists on the street to denounce Morsi's trial
Anger roars in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of the deposed President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the re-establishment of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial underlines this activist of the Muslim Brotherhood.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a lawsuit, it's a joke.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial is a pro-Morsi, he is supposed to have Sisi tried, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, 60 demonstrators were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel accuses 9 US states of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized homosexual marriage, "all military spouses have the right to an ID card from the Department of Defense and the benefits that come with it," the minister recalled in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses in the facilities of the National Guard" located in their territory, "he denounced, accusing these states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided at these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence stated that he had ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure that the federal legislation was implemented.
The nine-state frond began with Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defence official.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage at about 5,600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, the reserve and pensioners.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hyères
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hyères.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition should bring together the best skaters in the region.
Registration is on the spot on Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will start at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the award ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young Hyerite prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European championships in Copenhagen this year and he loves nothing as long as he goes back to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto Mayor Chases Journalists to Interrogate him on Drug Case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of taking drugs, according to several media reports.
A video handed over to the courts seems to support these suspicions.
The person concerned, Rob Ford, has always denied having used crack, while acknowledging that he has a penchant for cannabis.
This Thursday, he chased several journalists from his property who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in Val-d'Oise, clearly of foreign origin, while France has been free from indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The rabies diagnosis was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of those who could have come into contact with this kitten between 8 October and 28 October," explains the Ministries of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and have received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the press release says.
The ministries now call on persons who have been bitten, scratched, scratched or licked on a mucosa or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal has been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been free from rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free," according to the press release.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last recorded "indigenous" case of rabies occurred in December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE)."
One case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if it is not treated in time," remind departments and is transmissible for almost 15 days before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease.
Obama retreates his reform of the health care system
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unambiguous and often repeated promise that "if you are satisfied with your health system, you can keep it."
After hundreds of thousands of people received termination notices from their claimants, the Republicans criticized the president over the past few days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "an upsurge in the news" about cancellations, President Obama encouraged the Americans who received these opinions to seek new assurance on the market.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better-adapted health plans for the same price, or even for even less than expected.
"You'll get out winning," he said.
The Authority has announced that it should not be surprising if the 5% of the population who are self-insured find themselves forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Allow me to address these Americans directly: you deserve better," Kathleen Sebelius said in his testimony before the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the October launch of the online market had failed "lamentably."
"I'm as frustrated and irritated as anyone else," she added.
I can't wait to regain your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, while she believed her microphone cut, by addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Republican representative of Missouri, to determine whether she should join the Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long insisted on asking Ms. Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasted to millions of Americans.
Vettel Strenna a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The happily elected Jake Prekop combined the colours of the car brand with the German flag, while incorporating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, a quadruple Formula One World Champion, went on to race for the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday with a special helmet designed by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from 1,500 drawings sent from all over the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its stable.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion closely, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear that helmet on Friday and Saturday, at the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, to mark his fourth consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban party
Let us not be mistaken.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I address myself to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
However, his project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in his home town of Aubervilliers, was born of the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes the neighbourhoods above all.
My proposal number one is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Activist in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my programme are attached to the left, but if the right-wing people are ready to support me, I will also listen to them, he continues.
I'm not talking to extremist parties.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his programme - available on the Internet - on the basis of many themes intended to speak to suburban residents and especially young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at the age of 16, the rehabilitation of the function of building guardian...
Still to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. "For the 2014 municipal elections, this might be fair," he acknowledges. "
It's a time and money problem.
The Suburban Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune says he already has seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the support emails I have received since yesterday don't all emanate from suburbs," he rejoices.
John Kerry admitted, made unprecedented, that American espionage "went too far inappropriately"
John Kerry indicated a softening of the defensive attitude of the United States towards its surveillance programs by acknowledging, without precedent, that on several occasions espionage "went too far in an inappropriate way."
The Secretary of State also admitted that, like Barack Obama, he had ruled on "autopilot" when a series of inflammatory revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's espionage activities came into being.
The leaks put the US government at the centre of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government learned of some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, and then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the United States government to admit that American espionage had crossed the line, but insisted that everyone's rights had not been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it went too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make it clear to people that he is now carrying out a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels wrong.
I assure you that innocent people will not be abused in this process.
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: "We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We did prevent planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being murdered because we were able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged US espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism efforts with the US, said the President of the Senate Sub-Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said that he had spoken before the Members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding the possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations because of the frustration with the supervision of the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay with us in our mutual commitment to the fight against terrorism," said Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and Chairman of the Sub-Committee on European Affairs of the United States Senate, during an interview from Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA programmes.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some of the US allies, but the agency's director said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations referred to documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other Heads of State.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the espionage of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers.
The names of other participating legislators should be announced in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to show "loving firmness."
He explained that European heads of state must be honest with their citizens about the type of espionage programmes they have been implementing themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they must also understand that we are not the only ones in the world who spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry has planned to travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the resentment generated by American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by the surveillance activities of the United States.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, buoyed by Shell's poor performance and following an announcement by the Fed of its continued support for the economy, as planned.
Australian woman appeals prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgement and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Provincial Court on June 15 of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who mastered her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had safely returned to her hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interviewed Bamford for two days before she confessed to having invented the whole story.
She was detained in a cell at the local police station prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket rather than in a women's prison.
This is the daughter of former Australian rugby league player Peter Tunks, who appealed to the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs to help his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" with her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
"We've obviously had a very distressing time, but we hope to take her home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgement and was released after a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increased sentence of up to two years' imprisonment and imprisonment in an adult prison.
However, following the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to restore its deteriorated image to tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came with no other than RSCA buses
The French police decided to lay down strict rules concerning the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club of Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, spokesman for the Brussels-midi police area, said on Friday.
Belgian RSCA supporters who wish to attend this Champions League meeting will have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokesperson said.
The procedure will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had any intention of travelling to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has indicated that measures have been taken to make arrests or even police custody," announced Marie Verbeke.
Living together in French, the challenge of the school board Marguerite-Bourgeoys
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
A year ago, this was the reason for a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to consider how to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living Together in French."
Vision Diversité has been visiting schools for the past year to help students of all backgrounds discover common points of reference that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighbourhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of ethnic origin or whether they have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"So we create projects so that they identify with all of this," says Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne of the Institut du Nouveau Monde has identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of Quebec culture, a sense of belonging, support for staff in the transformations that we are experiencing, within the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board has set up a research centre that will give tools to teachers who also sometimes come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz of the Université de Montréal will be its Scientific Director.
Preparing to manage a class in a North American, Quebec context.
"Different educational strategies are the real need," she sums up.
Research will focus on inclusion in all its aspects: linguistic, academic, social and cultural.
