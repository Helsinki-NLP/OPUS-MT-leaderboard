Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria led to a marked weakening of the two parties forming the present great coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly serious losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthie Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphal return to the political scene at national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remain, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The ÖVP, which lost nearly nine percent of the votes at 25.6 percent, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two great parties in the post-war period; especially for the People's Party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the People's Party had a considerable lead over the SPÖ.
However, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the party leader and the current vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer was pronounced.
The observers believe that this could happen on Monday, during the extraordinary leadership council of the party.
Such an evolution would, a priori, facilitate the way to the outcome of the election, which remains the most likely outcome, namely the renewal of the major SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FPÖ) would have obtained 18 per cent and BZÖ 11 per cent of the votes - the Socialists expressed at the same time the fear of a repetition in 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (at the time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separated from it) on a common government, which even provoked sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently based on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
Obviously, no other party crossed the four per cent limit and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may get cold
If the problem of the Czech researchers accused in India of illegally picking cockroaches could not be resolved, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that this would lead to a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister declared it today in New York, after meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain cooling would occur," he observed after the meeting, carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the talks, that it was difficult for the executive to intervene in judicial matters.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was discharged from charge and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, the Darjeling government, and the case was under its jurisdiction.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
He would therefore be able to apply for bail and await the trial at liberty, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicted persons with "competent legal support," said the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided by India.
"Above all, we want to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that goes on for many years.
The Indians also recognize it, "Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, he stressed to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great misunderstanding," he said.
The minister dodged the question if he got a promise from India to deal with the matter.
"I have already received quite a number of promises," he found only.
A Czech arbiter the struggle for the bottom of the sea
It is nearing an electronic mural map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he was not interested in the continent, but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
"It belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself, "said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the head of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
The prevailing atmosphere is characterized by hard work and enthusiasm.
The seafloor hides a world that has so far been little known, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms for the time being unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer medicine.
A larger bottom than the land
The littoral states have now begun to vehemently aspire to the new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they use their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometres from the coast of the given country.
According to the Convention, the latter may claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
"For simplicity, the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea, is considered a continental shelf.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the 200 nautical miles that represent said exclusive economic yone, "Mikulka explains.
The request made by the country in question to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a wide range of scientific and technical documentation based on many expensive prospections and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five applications, from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful, "Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater possessions, has recently had a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, is 1.6 million square kilometres, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospections.
The benefit they will derive in the future from the exploitation of the seabed will, as they plan to do, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their requests.
They may do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention."
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean bottom, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of mankind."
There, no single state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area shall be assigned by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let us not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organisation "Interoceanmetal."
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other states, it obtained the status of the so-called "pioneer investor."
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaii Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The background is eventful, it is a sort of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract over an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a deposit rich in polymetallic concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese, "says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of this.
It recalls a small potato, or, with some imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were on the scene for the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are being revealed.
According to indications from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
For example, both Federal Army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Flight and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technischen Hilfwerk were at the site of liberation.
As the spokesman for the Ministries reported on Monday night, German forces were ultimately not required, as the hostage-takers released their prisoners and fled when they acknowledged the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it as a support force on the ground.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers had abducted in southern Egypt a group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as has the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have since arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the hostages released were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin for the time being, no information has been given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild," the five vacationers and the special forces should have taken off on an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Denies Rescue Plan
The first chamber of the US Congress has caused the $700 billion capital market rescue plan to fail by a small margin.
The Dow Jones was falling in the abyss.
By 227 votes to 206, the United States House of Representatives rejected the government's financial market rescue plan.
Despite all calls from US President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was to stem the chaos in the financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the parties had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the validity of this $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called for a vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he conceded.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones was down by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was the investor's concern that the state rescue plan could overthrow.
He returned shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into effect, approval by the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate is required.
Organisers report growing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the next few months according to a study, the turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite weak economic prospects, the thirst for German travel remains insatiable, according to this study.
With regard to bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent compared to the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) said on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent compared to 2007, confided the DRV.
The sources of these results are the GfK figures, which analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agencies on a monthly basis and makes estimates for the overall market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar price, travel to the United States would be particularly in demand, the RVD said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one-third.
Alongside this, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our country would be particularly sought after by the Germans.
Tour packages are particularly in demand, said DRV president Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs would be "easier to calculate for the customer than for an individual tour package."
Consumers can save money among other things with early booking discounts or All Inclusivie offers, said Laepple.
The summer months were also very successful, so that sales figures will again increase compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of German travellers has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Beer's Day
Ballermann's or Apres-Ski's hits continuously, beer in liter pitchers and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer festival.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I actually don't have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailored Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes at the beer party, and already photographers are throwing themselves at us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and this to my first visit at the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer festival tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once in Therese Square, everything is half the worse.
Almost everyone wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one seems blamed or ashamed - it's completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean costume picks up a few bizarre strokes at the banana-chocó stand.
A Bavarian reminds me that I would not have tied my apron properly: "to the left means free, in the middle virgin, in the right cased, in the rear widow."
Discretely, I'm tripping my buckle from the back to the left.
"It's better," she told me and laughed.
Others do not give themselves as much trouble for these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and show us their bare hindquarters without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer festival.
He finds it "gorgeous," with an elongated "ooooo."
He tells me all about it after he was relieved of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire hydrant that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild paders."
Others don't have the chance to get rid of alcohol this way.
At about eight o'clock in the evening, ribambelles of paramedics run on the square of the feast and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses act instead in packs - always by four, they drag their stretcher covered with tents in tents.
That's how it works for most beer party visitors: we go empty, we come back full of it.
Those who lie in the coffin of the drunk under the tarp are not visible.
"They are the ones who can't swallow anything anymore," cried one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappeared in the melee.
Victim of an accident identified by the police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He's been released ever since, on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought about joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps away, from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha station was designed in a neo-renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the guides tell us.
The monument is placed on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, with observation towers at each corner, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticketing, we have no doubt more about the size of the company, which represents a westward passage.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retarded imperialist, wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railroad that arrives in Damascus, Baghdad as well as the land better known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregularities.
The relative isolation of its surrounding area, generated by the cold war's frozen borders, is over.
The British and empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
Turkish sources claim that this is a sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruins, swallowed up in the meanders of history.
But today, the rail passage to Anatolia and all the oriental points, serve - at least symbolically - to emphasize the enlargement of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on a sleeper car in the direction of the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 hours and a half, shaken on noisy tracks whose pace reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived, in the Turkish capital - presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of a change in the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stone and steel, in a developing neighborhood, surrounded by half-built shopping malls and numerous pastries in which middle managers in suit-suits - men and women - meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Suit, tie, and he even has a Black Berry.
"the aim of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly, "he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its hinterland.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both.
She had to do both.
"but, now, at some point," I asked if "Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "does not want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone with whom I have been able to speak has recited to me by heart: the Turkish railway is not only going to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as it is for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe that is metaphorically travelling on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the station in Hydarpasha, after another night without sleeping, I thought of the two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period during which Turkey had been named "the sick of Europe."
At least there is no more doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Vernon Handley's memoirs, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the fantastic youth choir Proteus the following year.
The choir was supposed to include the under-21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 years old refused to abandon the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to manage any type of music, whether madrigal or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how Tod kept telling us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there, in the music.
So sing! "
His wand technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the music standard, he raised it a lot higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver is to be named a knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever let me down - and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley held such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, he said, "focus only on certain people."
A lot of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died September 25) states that "in 1946 he had resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
This is what came from the letter of Woodruff's author in Beyond Nab End, but this is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 1950s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Hops, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to hide this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino" Flamenco and Life "because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have drawn my attention to their simplicity and strength and to the fact that they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments. "
Second assault for Honda super sales
In November Honda will start marketing the second generation of the Jazz model.
While its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new monotole has an even larger interior space.
Added to this are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
So this is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monotole are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before looking at the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation has been put on the market.
First of all, Honda has refurbished this model within a shorter time frame than other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, it is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most sold car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less a million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in one year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will enable Honda to make up for the decline in sales in Spain.
Indeed, the brand hopes to end the year with a sale of 22,000 cars, i.e. 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid with a compact size - 4.37 meters in length - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars a year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be divided between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimetres more), its width is 1.69 metres (two centimetres more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimetres.
The height does not change, however, to 1.52 metres.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space is also increasing.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of gasoline in a central position, a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in addition to the first-generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2L safe is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to the exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improving access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, part of the back doors of the first Jazz which opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline propellers.
Both engines have i-VTEC technology that reduces gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions, makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2 litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This propellant - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
This 100-horsepower Honda Jazz 1.4L has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'bee car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has, this time, been inspired by nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating bee theft, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Centre made this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Brand Management Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan security shield.
This robot will allow the brand vehicles to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee creates his own personal space of an oval shape that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes composed of the bee, able to see in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is known as a laser locator (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles over a distance of two metres and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by twisting its wheels of 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Travel Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be turned up or down, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and according to what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid obstacles.
"Each second this device must only process information and act according to that data.
It does not need to keep the information or intuitive logic of prior manoeuvres, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may be surprising, but we are not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes. "
This is the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced in serial cars in about ten years after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
They're afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the United States Treasury, apart from having a lot of cash to make plans, is not without geniuses.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That's the hotel of bad credit... or stories.
The lugubrium aspect of this accommodation and especially of the Hotel Master leads us to think several times if this is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game gives useful but not detailed information.
It's more of a teenager's game.
¿What if the game ends?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, since it's unthinkable to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry in turn of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan's first bank, which will pay out nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a news welcomed by a sharp drop in its stock exchange price.
One week after unveiling an interim agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley Common Shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of 10% yield convertible securities with a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley indicated that the aggregate transaction would be conducted on the basis of an average unit price of $29, or 28% above its current price.
However, the Morgan Stanley action lost 6.79% to $23.07 around 5: 00 p.m. GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley's transition to banking holding status," said John Mack, Managing Director of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but bring him under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been modified in the last few days: last Monday Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to Japanese for about 8.5 billion dollars.
"A week ago," explained MUFG's Executive Director, Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, "we thought the participation would be entirely composed of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves. "
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert in one year half of its preferential securities into common shares if the latter exchange more than 50% above the conversion price, or approximately $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokesperson for the group refused to provide details on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to have a Tier One solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had "clearly" lightened his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which has seen its stock exchange rate meltdown by half as the cost of default insurance on its debt went off.
This cost decreased on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced raising $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Reconstitute the republic around the socialism of the 21st century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like its counterparts and friends, it was the third that put to the vote a draft new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, according to official results covering 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" vote was 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to obtain half of the votes plus one.
On Sunday, two polls at the polling stations and a count by a non-governmental organization announced a large victory of the "yes" between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed victory over his draft constitution on Sunday to Monday.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he assured, congratulating the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of Guayaquil Governorate, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which was held in a calm manner according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observer mission, was on a 444-point text consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the President.
The draft Constitution enshrines the power of the State over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and currencies sent by its emigrants.
Carried out by Correa, elected in 2006, the draft also grants enhanced powers to the Head of State, who will be able to serve up to two consecutive terms of four years and will have the possibility to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further strengthens the principle of free health and education services, which the President has begun to establish in the country of 13.9 million people, where 50 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for US anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were returned this Monday afternoon safely to the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived at about 3.30 p.m. on a special plane at the al-Maza military base, adjacent to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, aboard helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examination.
They are in "good health," and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, "said Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September in a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the outskirts of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been robbed from one cache to another by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptous, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official reported that 30 Special Forces personnel, carried on board two helicopters, attacked in the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of fire occurred, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official who requested anonymity.
He reported that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the flash unit had been sent to the Sudan, where they were supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian diplomat Franco Frattini mentioned the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces from Belgrade, where he is located.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our men in the secret services, the special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The previous day, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the kidnappers were present, killing in six, including the Chadian chief, and arresting two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately denied by the movement.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is making headlines and occupying this election campaign.
Good.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the sums of misery that are given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historic sites that are starving?
What politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Chinon castle in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbours, the Constitution of their country states that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, elected representatives and government departments in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers from 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned with searching history, preserving with three private archives and preserving archaeological remains.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, protesting with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers throw their bulldozers against our old and forgotten stones and cemeteries.
When will we have a forum for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are helping the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in distress following the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, by partially nationalising it. The three countries are supporting this financial and insurance institution with interest in Hungary for a sum of €11.2 billion.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourgish and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also calling on the European Central Bank and the competition authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis that has been growing for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (49%) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank will undoubtedly sell part of its holdings, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis shares started a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed in the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is far too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
On Friday alone, the company's shares dropped by 12 percent, reaching its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the present value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the company's managers, is unrealistic.
The management of the company is blaming the Atlantic for the uncertainty surrounding the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan to be responsible for the fall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, there has already been a slight increase in the number of papers.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new general manager.
The financial agency was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a substantive proposal.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank's customer circle and no agency was attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the hen house
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programmes which link the use of information concerning the prescription of medicinal products, in all cases, with the agreement of the data subject.
This kind of program has to be in independent hands, otherwise it's like entrusting a fox to his hatchery "- said Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage drug prescriptions, at the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the insured capital depend on the health of the client who presents himself, and if they consider that the risk is too great, they do not even guarantee it.
In the past, they sent the candidates to a medical examination, and they did not sign an insurance contract with them until they became aware of the results.
For the past ten years Dick has found a much cheaper procedure: from an identification number, he readily obtains from pharmacies the data concerning the person's purchases of medicines within the last eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, which disease the person suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, it refers to extremely high blood fat, which puts him or her in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk coefficient, so there is not much left to do for the insurer except the paperwork. However, tiny problems can still arise.
The disadvantages of this program include the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flushes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of the data, and they must ask the patient for authorisation before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are forced to do so by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their shortcomings in the past.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory test results, linking them with drug use data, so they are able to provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and at the same time the control of use is becoming more and more difficult.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on the extension of the control circle of the authorities concerning companies specializing in the supply of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not enough and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the data subject.
It is another question whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he refuses, the insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him.
Thus, and ultimately, hens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other, largely global, problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit, which will focus on cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognizes that India is a great emerging democratic power that should be given a broader voice in international affairs, but member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They did not dwell too much on this issue yesterday at the 9th summit in Marseilles.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and head of diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would double trade, which means an increase of more than 100 billion euros.
Taking into account that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be too ambitious a target.
To this end, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral agreements with India on civilian flights, and in this way air trade can also grow in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with India, which is the EU's leading trading partner, and New Delhi, which is only ninth among the EU's partners.
The summit devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan had been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and mention had been made of the urgency of holding a United Nations conference on that subject.
The completion of the Doha trade round was also called for, although both had a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains committed to the energy and climate programme, in particular that it would like to reduce its toxic releases by at least 20% until 2020.
India also agreed on this, as well as on the need for a global market at next year's climate conference, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent until 2050.
They would also like to prevent rising food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian Head of State is today visiting the French capital, where at a bilateral meeting he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to information from the news agency, the agreement would last for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than 300 Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for this edition, with more than 7 thousand exhibitors coming from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403thousand titles in exhibition, and Turkey as guest of honor.
It will be the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Goods and Cultural Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government, during the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Papillon: indeed, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italian Point-264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by an appointment with the press in the Struktur Room, at Butterfly 5.0 of the Buchmesse: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign authors' books is gradually decreasing relative to the total Italian production, and in particular, relative to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on the Nevada Desert, was found.
The debris was found on a plateau at an altitude of 3000 metres, in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the California-Nevada border.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, removed the remaining doubts: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it was the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The United States Transportation Safety Board (Ntsb) reported that a few hours after the wreckage was located, a team of investigators sent to the scene identified the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fosset's personal belongings were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fosset, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
By the sixth attempt, he had become the first man to complete the round of the world on an aerostatic balloon in 2002: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had flown around the world without stopping.
Among all these records, also that of flying at 15,445 meters, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect.
An extraordinary 4x4 of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and sharp angles.
Here, in summary, Glk, the last born of the "compact" off road of the star's house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this area.
Precisely because of its non-standard, unexpected and unconventional content will be the communication that will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showroom, from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising beat that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented mode of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automobile brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, which will dominate the heart of shopping in Milan, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real size and three-dimensional format.
Indeed, we will have the impression that when we look at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then reconstructed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this publicity Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotypical field of motorist communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in attracting the interest of future acquirers? We will see.
These are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they're risking the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created any big problems.
Neither had ever clashed with the opposite tifosi.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (little in fact) from Campania and Apulia were added.
They had tricolored flags on which appeared their original city: Saturday night, they were all removed so as not to be identified.
They are inspired by the English Tifoserie.
In Bulgaria, they found one of the real Nazists, the Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian tifosi, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had in fact controlled them all: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian tifosi who had a history of stage crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the trip.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the tifosi arrested or identified in the disorders purge a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo who forbids to visit the Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer set foot in the stadium.
Luckily.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others risk adding to the first 150.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize it," says the Viminal.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Puglia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets on Tuesday, the Casms, which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is to say the secret services, which deal precisely with the problems of the stadium.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the arm stretched during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria, this is not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the post of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste where a core group of supporters of Ultras Italy, founded in 2002, resides.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that renting Mussolini in Bulgaria is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 tifosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist," adds Observatory No. 1, "crimes must be attributed in the country in which they occur.
So far, this group has remained on track, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistles to Mameli's anthem: those too are not crimes, but if you allow me, they are not polite... "
