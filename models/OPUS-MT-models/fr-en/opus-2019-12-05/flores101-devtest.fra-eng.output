The American Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts the absolute need of the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC (United States Olympic Committee) statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, could be better served. This can be done by moving forward and making significant changes within our organization, rather than by revoking accreditation.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that could shed light on how the abuse of the proportion so courageously described by Larry Nassar's survivors could have gone unnoticed for so long and adopt any necessary and appropriate change.
USA Gymnastics and USOC have the same goal: make gymnastics, as well as other sports, as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive and responsible environment.
Throughout the 1960s, Brzezinski worked for John F. Kennedy as an advisor, and later for the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widely used theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as colour and three-dimensional layout.
Scientists say the plumage of this animal was brown brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, which is called rachis, but show other characteristics specific to feathers - beards and barbules - researchers have inferred from this that rachis was probably an evolutionary development subsequent to these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for temperature control or display. Researchers suggested that, even if it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists point out that this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, but the sample reveals a plumage belonging to an adult individual, not to a young person.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office stated that 19 of the wounded were police officers.
Police reported that they suspected an alleged Daesh activist (IE) as the suspect responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as other stars. The activity of all stars in the system is determined by their brightness, rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to plasma flow.
With regard to magnetic inversions, the smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is.

He added that "they should not, however, be asked to assume obligations beyond their stage of development, responsibility and capacity."
The Iraq Study Group presented its report today at 12: 00 GMT.
He warns that no one can guarantee that any action in Iraq at this stage will put an end to sectarian war, increasing violence or the slide towards chaos.
The report opens with an appeal for an open debate and consensus-building in the United States on policy towards the Middle East.
The report is very critical of almost all aspects of the government's current policy towards Iraq and strongly calls for an immediate change of direction.
The first of its 78 recommendations is that a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against hostile intervention and to restore diplomatic relations with its neighbours.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a traction on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and consists of a large number of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new mutation was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate." "
Some patients were reported to have contracted the virus in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, and at least two of them were hospital staff.
Over a one-year period, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.

After the dam was built in 1963, the seasonal flooding that was expected to spread sediment into the river was halted.
This sediment was necessary for the creation of sandbanks and beaches, which served as habitats for wildlife.
As a result, two species of fish have disappeared and two others are endangered, including the humpback.
Although the water level will only rise a few metres after the flood, the authorities hope that this will be enough to restore the eroded sand banks downstream.

Infrared images reveal, given the variations in temperature at day and night, that these are probably caves.
"They are cooler than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night."
"Their thermal behaviour is not as stable as that of the large caves on the planet that maintain a constant temperature, but they are similar in that they are deep holes in the earth," says Glen Cushing, a member of the USGS (American Centre for Geological Studies) crew and staff at the University of North Arizona located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put in an envelope a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have checked his or her identity, the elector throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his or her voter card.
The French Electoral Code regulates operations fairly strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that electors and observers can see that no envelope is present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelope is added, except those of electors duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each stage of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under high supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

She first took part in the slalom, where she got a "did not finish" (DNF) in her first race. 36 of 116 competitors got the same result in that race.
His other race, the giant slalom, allowed him to finish in the tenth place of the group of women sitting with a combined time of 4: 41.30, 2: 11.60 minutes less than the Austrian Claudia Loesch, first finish, and 1: 09.02 minutes less than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, ninth finish.
In the category of women in sitting skiing, four skiers were unable to finish their course; for giant slalom, 45 of a total of 117 skiers in this race were unable to finish.
Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: "We arrested five people for raping the Swiss citizen, and we recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The defendants are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, Commissioner of Police, stated that the accused had their faces hidden when they appeared before the court.
Although three people were present in the house when the car hit her, none were injured.
However, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The track where the accident took place was temporarily blocked to allow the emergency services to extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to the Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son by the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh.
She is in custody pending her indictment and trial, but eyewitnesses could be compromised as her portrait has been widely disseminated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have considered the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University notes that "journalists seem to follow a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all prosecutions, has advised journalists that no further comments will be made at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will address the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of existing borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics discussed include the future State of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel requires a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only consents for a period of five years.
The shooters of the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by rangers as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Park and Heritage Conservation Officer at NPWS, the four shooters designated for the first slaughter season were properly trained and trained in safety instructions.
Martelly yesterday introduced a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
It is the fifth PEC of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to get the country on the road to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were scheduled to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of defective iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it had been aware of 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "non-serious."
The department responded by describing Apple's postponement of the report as "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7: 19 a.m. local time (9: 19 p.m. GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office stated that no damage had been reported in that country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Centre stated that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and the deaths of at least six of them have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released prematurely, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He was trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating premature deliveries during his free time.
Her research has shown that if a hormone is given, it will accelerate the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or "black boxes") on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. A unique moment, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as weird as me... or even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... I hope she rests in a better place."
A survey of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal elections revealed that the number of opponents of Australia's transformation into a republic had increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those interviewed share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29% of respondents felt that Australia should become a republic as quickly as possible, while 31% thought that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim 100 m and 200 m freestyle and in three relay stations at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his complaints, his physical condition was questioned.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to overcome his pain, which was forbidden within the Games.
Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest number known to date.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and promote life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He described the rumours as "chatter and political nonsense."
He is expected to run for the presidency in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, not ground radar systems used previously, which allows air controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transportation is non-existent and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, and parking lots and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transport led to the possibility that the game could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in only two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following reproduction between an endemic Darwin pinson, Geospiza fortis, and the conical-beaked immigrant pinson, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways. It can be rolled in tiny pieces
It can be pulled in fine wire, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or laminated in leaves.
It can be made very thin, and glued to another metal. It can be so fine that it has sometimes been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cauliflower juice changes colour depending on the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the chemical tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since the hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then press them into a ball with the wet and clean hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets equipped with flushing in almost all houses, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of sewage systems were found in the houses of the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the public baths where men and women met.
When you call a person thousands of kilometres away, you use a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and then returns it to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 30 metres high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways. The biggest advantage it has brought us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below are medium-sized cats that eat equally medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat small, much larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each feline, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats, living in large groups called packs.
The packs are composed of one to three related adult males, as well as about 30 females and young lions.
Women are generally very close to each other, with a large number of sisters and girls in their families.
Lion troops act like packs of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other great felins) in their behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes difficult), swim, jump long distances and draw with five times the strength of a powerful human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four felins are the only ones able to roar.
The roar of the tiger does not resemble the broad roar of the lion, but rather a phrase whose words would be cries and rumblings.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost all the animals the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it is.
According to scientists, ocelots track and find the animals to eat (prey) by smell, sniffing their journey on the ground.
They see very well in the dark thanks to their night vision, and also move very furtively. Ocelots hunt their prey by melting into their environment before throwing themselves on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily go back), it often finds itself in an environment different from that in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so that the new population will need new features or adaptations to be a powerful competitor to what it previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to belong to the same species.
We call this process "speciation," which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhalate (i.e., exhales).
Plants produce their food using the sun by photosynthesis and provide shade.
We make our homes and our herbal clothing. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the superpredator of the time, he feared nothing except the other mosasaurs.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth like razor blades, as well as an additional set of teeth in the palate, so that everything that crossed his path could not escape.
We're not sure, but he may have had the tongue forked. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been cannibal.
He also attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur such as a T. rex was no match for him.
Although the Romans consumed food we know, they ate some strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and the roe, a kind of rodent.
Another difference: while the poor and the woman ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to organize banquets together where they rested on the side while they were eating.
Roman meals of antiquity could not include these foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced into Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard, then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could access.
Some pyramidal towers, the ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family took place in the open air.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were only open counters overlooking the street. The houses were built of stones.
As there were no large forests in Canaan land, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland has been sparsely populated. In the Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been exiled from Iceland for murder that he found Greenland - and named it so - travelling further west.
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there at the time.
Although each country is "Scandinavian," there are many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you may think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" appeared at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one really knows who wrote it, it is known that at an early stage of its existence, the large parchment (about 29 inches three quarters by 24 inches) was stored rolled.
It is therefore likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landing and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was governed by the French of Vichy, the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of facing him.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation "Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Forces de la France Libre had liberated southern France and were heading for Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The term "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil and is related to the Latin words "civilians," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it relates.
Cities-states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the revolutionary war, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - Congress being its only component - under the articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to impose taxes and, since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the authorities of the State, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from tax laws or laws on customs duties between States.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all States before they could be amended, and States took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the world's second-largest team and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to its group of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, while European navigators passing through it referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous cereal production practices and employing Chinese workers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which then ruled the island until 1945.
The Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the temple of the sun and the hall of the three windows.
Most of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been rebuilt to provide tourists with a better view of their original appearance.
In 1976, thirty per cent of Machu Picchu had been restored and this restoration continues until today.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world is 35 mm; it was the most widely used film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but what matters is that its image format is inherited from the photographic sensor format of digital cameras.
The size 35 mm is actually, and it's pretty disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
So it is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is 3: 2.
Many common formats (e.g. family of APS formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The third-party rule, which is very ill-treated and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism while providing protection for the image.
It indicates that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines dividing the image into third parties vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christian religion has bound European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone, from king to commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds are specifically there for this reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for more than 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many to wonder whether this doctrine was respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain put in place a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proved to be effective, cutting down vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that the blockade violated international law generally accepted and codified by several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain minted international waters in order to prevent ships from venture into entire maritime zones, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
Since this tactic has only elicited a timid reaction, Germany expected a similar reaction in the face of its unlimited underwater war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency for pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during the First World War, nations wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept employment with the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his director in his previous job) to the attention of Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different epochs; every step of China or every family in power was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also an unstable age of divided provinces. The best known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era that took place for 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the most bloody epochs in the history of Chinese antiquity. Thousands of people died in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xl'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
Also, after the Revolution, the trades were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the army, because the classification of armies is no longer based on class, but on calibre.
The French Revolution also inspired many other working classes repressed from other countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that were beyond the realm of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as "Hira '" on the mountain of "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived at the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is totally isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy at all to find, even if you know it exists. When you entered the cave, you're completely isolated.
Above, you can contemplate nothing other than the clear and beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. From the inside of the cave, you can only see or hear very few things from this universe.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only of the seven wonders that still exist today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third millennium BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honour of the dead pharaohs.
The Gizeh plateau, or "Gizeh necropolis," in the valley of the Dead in Egypt, includes several pyramids (the largest pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, many temples and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Kheops, and many small pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The "push" symbol resembles a V and the "pull" symbol resembles a clamp or square with the lower side missing.
The top means you have to start with the tip and push the bow, and the bottom means you have to start with the rise (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
A bow up usually produces a softer sound, while a bow down is stronger and more assertive.
Do not hesitate to write your own marks in pencil, but do not forget that the printed archet marks are for a musical reason, and that they should be respected in general.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, age 11, and Louis-Charles, age 4) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, all terrified, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a crowd of saleswomen.
In a carriage, they went back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people yelling and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced, because of the crowd, to open the windows of their carriages.
At one point, a member of the crowd branded the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrorized queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the superprofits resulting from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental benefits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of order.
These events took place in the period generally considered the High Middle Ages - period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Central Age was preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or the technological imperative to a strict sense that humanity's destiny is dictated by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process that goes far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology has an impact on intrinsically rather than socially conditioned societies.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Massive car ownership also has a greater impact on road accidents, leading to the invention of new health care technologies to treat bodily harm.
Romanticism presented an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
According to the theories of Romanticism, geography would have shaped individuals and, over time, customs and culture related to this geography would have emerged, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was regarded as a feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicentre of luxury began around the year 400, and lasted up to about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Crusaders came back with gifts such as silk and spices, with which Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western modes could be delayed by 25 to 30 years.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the crusades, was the use of buttons to close clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is an agriculture used to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system, using conserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers used subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and share the same ideas, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and / or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic or a combination of factors.
The members of a sub-culture often report their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes modes, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or wilful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
These children are considered "ferocious" or wild. Some wild children have been locked up by persons (usually their own parents); in some cases the abandonment of this child was due to the rejection by the parents of a serious intellectual or physical disability suffered by the child.
Wild children may have been severely abused or traumatized before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in nature.
When fully bred by non-human species, wild children exhibit behaviours (within the limits of their physical arrangements) that are almost identical to those of animals that have raised them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who discover new teaching such as using a new program or starting a new project.
The supports can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of support, but the small man trombone of Microsoft Office is also one.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult to manage for the student alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, extortion and abuse.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratuities.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are seen as major factors that promote the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to great discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions during a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such interpretive abilities of human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variation, and the selection removes it from the reserve of the expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination alternate between the two basins for each generation.
In savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to satisfy its amino acid requirements from available plant resources.
In addition, a lack of response has serious consequences: growth disorders, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be proteins contained in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, food of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) is easy to digest while providing a large amount of protein containing all vital amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised if our own ancestors have solved their "protein problem" in the same way as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening during your sleep period and sleepiness shortly thereafter (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively silent awakening, in order to make you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself reset the clock during your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking a lot of liquids before falling asleep (including water or tea, known to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
A person's degree of inner peace is opposed to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the present vital force. Every person has the opportunity to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but has been enriched by the path of Mahayana love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With the Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illumination energy) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deity. It is thanks to the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleaned, the chakras activated, and the awareness of awakening created.
Germany was a common enemy during the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures ended the understanding between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would see real clashes, through alternative armies, on battlefields in Africa as well as in Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Soviet Union Red Army soldiers arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient means of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The work of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move its people and property.
One of the most remarkable recent examples of this situation was the North Atlantic campaign during the Second World War. Americans were trying to get soldiers and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, mainly using U-Boots, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany could probably have conquered Britain as it did for the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks wandering on hills or other grazing areas, often cared for by rafters who were mostly children or adolescents, similar to the more known term shepherds. These pastoral methods still exist today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the car tracks were simply made up of parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.
The crosses were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place. However, it was gradually realized that the runways would be more effective if they were equipped with an iron strip on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused more wear on the wooden wheels of cars.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began to walk up two million years ago with the arrival of the Homo Erectus ("right man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecs, did not walk up as usual.
Bipede specializations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus was able to walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even militate to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases, this is symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not only want a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is clear that the world has changed greatly as a result of the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and that the problems have become greater because of the overpopulation and extravagant way of life of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Broadsides."
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the Court of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had his troops read it in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets still known to exist are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are called birds.
Few people consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are a lot of things about birds that still look like a dinosaur.
They have legs covered with scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their two back legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary numbers, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately visible. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic domestic drugs or chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term "insect" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects that are very suitable for parasitizing humans.
Reductions, like bedbugs, are nestling, that is, adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the major neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may well feel that it is not in their best interests, or in the interests of the child, to care for the upbringing of a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption project for their baby.
In the context of an adoption, biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main objective of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
This is not the only experiment, however, and an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but which also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, and in particular on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including psychology, were accepted.
With the decline of knowledge of Greek, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behaviour often depend to a large extent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments to mark either phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the extent of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only germ cell mutations can be transmitted to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who want to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying ecosystem information are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go see, photograph and discover Borneo's orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small country towns by car to go to their workplace and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a passenger car-based transport system.
Science now shows that this massive carbon-based economy has removed the biosphere from its state of stability that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transport engineers simply incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
The traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and private vehicles between two points, and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be represented mathematically approximately.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships assist in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragons and ephemeral flies.
A few thousand years ago, a man called Aristarque claimed that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system was moving around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times the volume of water on the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the largest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 km wide.
No less than 20% of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main arm of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of small rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed by their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, who were then well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
The Vatican City drafts its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of the Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, because they are in the raw form of nature and are quite simple to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consisted of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
Rather, they were the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also put forward the theory that they turn into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys are also found that include a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could enter the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing methods has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and fewer uses.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a pencil sharpener.
One can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next novelty comes.
The fission bomb works according to the following principle: it transforms energy by assembling a nucleus of a myriad of protons and neutrons.
Kind of like climbing a hill to a heavy cart, dividing the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, so they tend to break with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made up of stones and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker under continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is finer. It was easier for the lava to go up to the surface.
The theories of content focus on what makes people feel good or are attracted.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and / or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what motivates some people to want the things they do and what, in their environment, motivates them to do or not to do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. From one end of the spectrum being to try to remain "the right boyfriend" (or the right girlfriend).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting assessments, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he / she must change everything that the group has created so far and do things in his / her own way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behaviour often leads to dissension between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of a virtual team often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each member is accountable and sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to take on the tedious process of creating a learning structure? Innovation is one of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice.
When all available resources are effectively used in the substantive services of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization is innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presented the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus reducing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behaviour supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of damage, lesions, tumours and brain injuries affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The growth of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our mind.
Although Artificial Intelligence is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
The purpose of artificial intelligence research is to automate tasks by machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and recognition of writing, voice and face.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focusing on the provision of solutions to the problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as has been developed in several home computer and video games software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school class. Often, a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is provided by technology in the form of virtual educational outings. Students can watch the ancient objects of a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a superb work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically participating in an excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design an annual website dedicated to their visit to the state capital. Each year, the site is updated, but older versions are kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try the blog experience with neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually changes the situation.
As students are often the most critical audience, the blog author is beginning to try to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "requires students to learn more about the world around them." The need for public interest encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs" "can help students build analytical capacity and critical thinking: by actively reacting to online content, they can compare their views with those of others and present their own views on specific topics" "(Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a large number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south you will find Niagara Falls and to the north, the Muskoka area and its surroundings which have a pristine natural beauty.
All these measures, and many others, make Ontario what foreigners consider Canada's quintessence.
Large areas further north are relatively sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that surprises more than one: There are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent by itself, in terms of wildlife.
Most small islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known to be luxury seaside resorts.
Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion spread widely to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Town road linking Europe with India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman who travels say that she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear an alliance (which should not seem too valuable.
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours that they consider harassment, because it is common for them to be followed, caught by the arm, etc.
Be firm in refusing men advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber sinners in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenix, the Romans and the Merinides as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who after having destroyed it had rebuilt it and named it Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading counters there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to make purchases.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, nargilés and bibelots of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the eastern extreme of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably certain, any visit outside Goma must be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascension of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as for treks tracking mountain gorillas among the cheapest in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (taxi motorcycle) to move around in Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a small race.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for distant and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites at Risk due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates' PBS show "Wonders of the African World."
The city contrasts strongly with the cities of the rest of the country, because it has an Arab style rather than an African style.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in north-eastern South Africa and runs along the Mozambique border to the east, from Zimbabwe to the north and the south-east border of the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19,500 km ², divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific wildlife area.
It is one of the best known amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily admission and conservation fees for the park.
It may be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card that provides access to some parks in South Africa, as well as to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main focus of interest for many tourists.
The row of buildings drawing the Hong Kong horizon has been compared with a glittering bar graph, which is reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To admire the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and reach the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the northern shore.
This is the place that British settlers have invested, so it seems to me to be a good starting point, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this region.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not composed solely of mangrove marshes; they also contain some of the last vestiges of the majestic jungles that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km ², about a third of which is covered by water / swamp areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, where you can find about 400 tigers from the Royal Bengal and 30,000 spotted deer.
The buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (located on the other shore) throughout the day, but most of them, especially those serving the east and Jakar / Bumthang, leave between 6.30 a.m. and 7.30 a.m.
Inter-district buses are often complete, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese caboteurs, which are comfortable and robust.
Group taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a shroud bridge. It overlooks the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapocus to Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock to Guyana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the largest indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes that inhabited the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú or the Payaguá, survived mainly through fishing, hunting, or gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "the giant province of India," was born of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spaniards inaugurated the period of colonization, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas polo grounds.
In addition, smaller tournaments and games are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo games, visit the Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the pound of the Falkland Islands (FKP), the value of which is equivalent to a pound sterling (GBP).
The money can be exchanged at the only island bank located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is widely accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the surrounding islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, even if the British and American currencies may be accepted. Talk to the owners in advance to agree on a payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange money from the Malvinas outside the islands, so change it before leaving the islands.
Montevideo is located in southern Ecuador, and winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to the summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in subtropical areas and summer temperatures above 30 ° C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but wind and humidity combine to give the impression that it is colder than what the thermometer says.
There are not really "rainy" and "dry" seasons: precipitation is about constant throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are wildlife; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you must be at least 100 metres from bears and wolves and 25 metres from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may appear, bison, moose, moose, bear and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they haven't kept enough distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid transporting or cooking scent food and keep camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval impasse in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
Supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the city during the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement.
The beaches are numerous, as Auckland is straddling two ports. The most popular are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour District) are located on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy and allow for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the port of Waitemata, in the chic suburb of Mission Bay and Saint Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, which are sometimes very popular with families, have many shops along the coast. Swimming is safe there.
The main local beer is the "Number One," a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer. There is also another local beer, the "Manta."
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the water from the local tap safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you have concerns about it.
For Australians, the idea of a "cream coffee" is foreign. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccino is filled with cream (no moss) and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips on the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from one of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all signs and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, north of 1770, the box jellyfish arrived near the beaches and river estuaries, and sometimes they could also be seen outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most of them are afraid of humans and would depart from them.
The saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat is in estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
The advance booking gives the traveller the peace of mind to know that he will have a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation service or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They may also withhold the reservation for you if you need time to reflect on the offer or obtain other documents necessary for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests should be addressed to the travel agency first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to participate closely in the musical event, you will have to arrive early to find a well-placed camping area.
Remember that even if the musical performances are finished on the main scenes, other musical performances can continue until late in the night on other venues of the festival.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise at the most exposed hut.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money customers spend. Windows and clocks are rarely found there, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special offers of dishes, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them on site.
On some sites, it is the premises that offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. Nevertheless, drunkenness alters judgment, and all good players know that it is crucial to stay sober.
Anyone who goes by car to high latitudes or passes mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, it can fall in very little time enough snow to block you.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or powder or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important moment for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to an excursion to African land, and in particular to savannah, with the aim of witnessing the spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment allows them to be observed.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "walking in the bush," "walking safari" or "footing") consists of hiking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing approximately 7,000 yen.
If wet clothes are ironed, they can be dried more easily. Many hotels have iron and ironing boards that can be lent even if they are not available in the rooms.
If you do not have an iron or if you do not want to wear ironing socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you find one.
Avoid overheating the fabric (which can cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are different methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some localities, it is sufficient to boil water for one minute; in others, it is necessary to boil water for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you have a problem, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that they do not know about in their area of origin.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation or, in the most serious cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are generally not considered parasites.
In some communities, duty-free shops offer an opportunity to purchase tax-exempt and excise-duty-free goods.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes make considerable savings, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind: steep slopes, narrow lanes and tight curves predominate.
The speed limitations displayed are significantly lower than in previous and subsequent sections - generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km / h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than before.
On the other hand, mobile service is curiously much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit pastries are common: apples are cooked and cooked in pastries all year round, while cherries and plums point the tip of their nose in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes often marry especially well with a tight cup of coffee.
If you want small but copious pastries, try the Berlin balls, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be "solid" or "liquid," depending on the amount of sauce it contains.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
As Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional kitchens throughout the country.
However, when this term is used without further qualification, it tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now, widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of dishes that are simply seasoned, with the main flavors that Javanese prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: the user's feet can be stuck there.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but has a foot in the leg, he could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety measures can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth and fairly narrow heel and sole.
Then, some stools, especially the English, have safety bars that allow a stab to fall from the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - The destination of excellence for climbing in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with many large granitic cliffs and walls.

Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of slipping down a snowy trail with skis or snowboarding tied to the feet.
Ski is a major travel activity with many aficionados, sometimes called "ski bums," who organize their entire holidays according to the ski in specific places.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 BC!
The practice of alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century; the first leisure ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegian people.
Skiing: this activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or hiking skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing, as well as mountaineering, but does not generally incorporate these activities, which are practised on rough terrain and require the use of much more rigid skis and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to travel a little longer distances than walking - but you will rarely reach cross-country ski speeds without a heavy backpack on damaged tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries, and in conventional circumstances, travelling through several countries means having to make several visa applications and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, works a little like a single country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this area, you can usually cross borders without going through passport checkpoints.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply separately for a visa for each of the space member countries, saving time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition for determining whether a manufactured object is an antiquity. Some tax agencies define goods over the age of 100 as antiquities.
The criteria vary depending on the location; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Artisanal products may be considered antiques, even if they are less ancient than similar industrial products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance to many other professions.
Although, according to tradition, not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer farming, they lived in fishing, hunting and similar activities, while using reindeer mainly as draught animals.
Today, many Sami are engaged in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.

The opinions presented are often superficial, general and too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Violent weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that may cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and can be of many kinds, depending on geographic, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Severe winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, sea clips and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to learn about the risks of bad weather that may affect their destination area, knowing that this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone planning to travel to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
An Internet search of "Course in hostile environment" will probably provide the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are common, but there are few publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning a sex change operation abroad must ensure that they have valid documents in their possession for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that are not gender-specific (X) or documents updated to match the name and sex desired varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
Searches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive in the post-11 September 2001 era.
Pre-operative transsexuals should not expect to pass the scanners while preserving their privacy and dignity.
The pull-out currents are the currents that return from the waves that break on the beach, often on a scroll or equivalent.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated on a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to the deep waters can form there.
In most cases, deaths are due to exhaustion as a result of an attempt to swim against the current, which may not be possible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to target a place where you won't be taken again. It is also possible, depending on your skills and whether you have been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
Reintegration shock occurs earlier than cultural shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and may be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adapting to the new culture may find it very difficult to adapt to their original culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have already adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your original culture.
At first, when you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travellers to a new country had to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed for travellers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the region's most interesting attractions for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the noise of tourists and sellers. The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long history.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and 16 of them are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples: the island of Livingston and Deception, where the caldera flooded with a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth Land is the southern part of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains melt in the plateau, then reappear to form the 360-km-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson massif, which peaks at 4892 m.
In remote areas, without a cellular telephone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite telephony.
A satellite phone does not usually replace a mobile phone, because you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by navigation, including pleasure craft, as well as by expeditions with remote data transmission and telephone needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about the connection to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn by travelling, and more and more of them choose this option.
This formula is particularly appreciated by young people who leave school because it allows them to take a year off before university, without compromising their education.
Often, taking sabbatical year classes abroad may actually give you a better chance of pursuing higher education in your country.
As a general rule, tuition fees are required to attend these educational programs.
Finland is a top destination for recreational boating. The "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in the archipelagos and on the lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Recreational boating is a national hobby in Finland, with one boat for seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that, it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most of the cruises on the Baltic are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while returning to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore with cruise tours, you will not need a separate visa (starting in 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not at all located near the seaside and no visit to this city is included in the price of the cruise.
Travelling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or experienced a traumatic event.
This is not to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about aircraft functioning and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Transport companies are well paid for quick deliveries. Often, as part of an urgent repair, the issue of time limits is crucial for documents, goods or spare parts related to them.
On some roads, large companies have their own aircraft, but on other roads and for small businesses, there has been a problem.
Had they sent goods by air on some routes, it would have taken days to pass the unloading and customs.
The only way to send it faster was to send it as a registered baggage. Air regulations will not allow them to send baggage without passengers, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a large amount of money for this privilege (or, better yet, to ask your company to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic rate for the business class, and eleven times for the first class!
In general, there is no need to seek reductions for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines know very well that they can count on a certain type of travellers who are willing to pay very high prices for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares in an informed manner.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but recognized by no United Nations member country.
Economic ties have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent connecting platform.
What was the ancient city of Smyrne is today a modern shopping center, developed and alive, set up around a huge bay, surrounded by mountains.
The large boulevards, stained glass buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red tile roofs, from the 18th century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that reminds more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.

Remember that you visit essentially a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant part of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labour, whether Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't joke about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disfigure the site by marking or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan only, as the law establishes that this is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude and arrogant.

Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their time was not as worrying as it is today, they are generally located in cities or on campuses, easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge infrastructures located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favourable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first feasts of cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor only for himself and the other members of the nearby aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants have their most beautiful appearance when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "one."

All the animals that arrived on these islands originally did so by water, swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of their long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant turtle the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you can discover the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
It is a good opportunity to admire the aurora borealis, because the sky will be dark almost all day.

Japan's work culture is more hierarchical and formal than that to which Westerners can be accustomed.
Costumes are classic work outfits, and employees are called by their family name or function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, as it emphasizes collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to obtain the consent of their superiors for any decision they take and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
