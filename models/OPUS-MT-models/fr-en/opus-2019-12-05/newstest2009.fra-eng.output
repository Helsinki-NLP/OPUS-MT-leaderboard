At the end of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange swapped in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with ČEZ equities accounted for almost half of the usual daily exchanges.
On Tuesday, from the beginning of the exchanges, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its fall the day before, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
The reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which refused to adopt the US financial sector stabilization plan, is also noticeable in our country.
Fall of shares in Asia
On Tuesday, Asian stock exchanges suffered a dramatic fall, even though the evidence succeeded in wiping out some of the losses during the day.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Hang Seng Index lost four per cent during trading, but later it wiped out some of the losses and reduced the drop to almost 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the Chinese stock movement of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost 3.8 per cent, with markets closed in Shanghai.
Sydney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five per cent, but eventually losses were reduced to 4.3 per cent.
According to his index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitation about rescue action in the US will influence financial markets around the world," said Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its own monetary policy, that is, independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should soon resume negotiations and adopt the proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries might suffer the consequences.
The bloodbath of American actions
On Monday, the US House of Representatives rejected the financial system support project, to which it should have spent up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion Kč).
The legislators thus denied the call for the support of President George Bush's project.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, American actions were bloodshed and the main indices of actions had the greatest fall in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones Index lost nearly seven percent, having experienced a fall of this magnitude for the last time in 1987.
The index was already losing during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress gave way: US government can inject $700 billion into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement for the U.S. financial system.
It will be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
American legislators made a decisive turning point in the talks on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of $700 billion (approximately DKr 12 trillion) in financial assistance to the US financial system.
Success, however, is not certain.
Before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, the Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The financial system support plan will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
Says on Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the Chamber's banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at the earliest, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate a priori.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reviving the financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market support can be effective, there will be a "disillusionment."
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that the market stabilisation package should take, "said the Democrat Nancy Pelosi, Agency Bloomberg.
In her view, the final vote could be taken as early as Sunday.
On the night of Saturday to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met the US finance minister Henry Paulson, in order to give the government a final form.
It should repurchase from financial companies unmarketable real estate assets that cause financial firms to lose significantly and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
This market recovery plan still needs to be pursued, but I think we are, "says Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchanges
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on falling equity markets.
According to the Democratic Senator did escape Harry Reid, the legislators are making sure that the Congress will reach a final agreement by Sunday.
They want to calm down investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress's decision could affect Monday's trade.
For the time being, however, it is impossible to say with certainty when the two chambers of the American Congress will proceed to the vote, or whether the negotiations are not likely to remain blocked, at the last moment, by any particular problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted in the coming days.
However, there will still be a number of changes to the law.
The total amount earmarked for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
But if Congress feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, it has the possibility to block the allocation of the remaining amount, following two steps: first, an additional $100 billion, and then, finally, $350 billion.
Bush welcomed progress in negotiations
Although the President can put his veto on this decision, Congress has the opportunity to put him in a minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad real estate, whose value fell, because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday to the vote of the law, and the Senate on Monday, "said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush is himself pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson, Tony Fratto, said that Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Limitation of golden parachutes
The Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, chief negotiator, said that legislators have agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, the protection of contributors against losses, the discount agreement, the progress of the plan on the axis of time.
The new law also provides for the limitation of golden parachutes for the directors of the companies participating in the programme and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this issue and have made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides assistance for homeowners, who have problems to pay for.
The government should negotiate further advance payments for mortgages it will buy back, while reducing debtors' monthly payments and allowing debtors to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its realization will be very difficult.
"And this is due to the fact that it is not known what the mechanism and price of buying back problematic assets will be.
This point will be decisive in deciding on the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government, "said Marek this week at the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or early next week, is, according to Marek, not that important.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as early as this week, that they support this plan and that they work on it as soon as possible.
This psychological meaning of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, is most important at the moment, "emphasized Marek.
An extreme struggle: MP3 players against mobiles.
We'll advise you, how to choose
While virtually all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only a phone.
However, there are sufficient reasons to obtain an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the mode of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy a expensive gramophone for the house to put on the new album by Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not come out on vinyl disk, and, from the point of view of quality, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there are swollen vinyl discs in your shelves, with rock art, jazz or blues, you're at least probably dreaming of such a gramophone.
The same applies to music during travel, i.e. compressed music, to put it simply - music in MP3.
Here too, there are categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just like a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble supporting earphones bought for twenty crowns at the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some high-end music players are capable of much more than just reading music, but these are unknown functions, of course, of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Apart from the primary functions, telephone calls and text messages, he is able to read music and movies, to record them, he has a camera of variable quality and can, for example, to serve as a navigator.
And if you take Smartphones and communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are witnessing almost a miracle.
However, the universal nature of motive is not without drawbacks.
The larger the number of functions you use, the smaller the interval between two reloads.
And reading music is one of the most important energy gulfs.
There are few mobile phones that are able to play music for 10 to 12 hours, in most cases this figure is much lower.
In this respect, the music players (especially the most rudimentary ones) are significantly better performing.
In the case of cheap mobiles, expect that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, moreover, you sometimes call from time to time, get, to be sure, a second charge for the work - this being valid even for the more expensive devices.
The problem will not arise for MP3 players, who are capable of continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient, after reloading.
Another problem arises when recording music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, especially since not all devices can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
We can, of course, record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers know how to do it without any reduction, given the tiny dimensions of memory cards used in mobiles.
As far as readers are concerned, you do not need any software except iPod.
Simply fill the music device from the computer through the USB connector.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified according to the name of the performer, the title of the album, the style, or the judgement of the user.
Some devices display only an index with a tree structure, like Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you should be particularly interested in the life of the accumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If the music is for you, basically, a background noise and if you will listen to it during the day, for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, you just need any mobile reading the MP3.
Virtually all mobiles are capable of doing so today.
You don't even have to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or player is able to read.
All are able to read the MP3 and the vast majority of the music that will reach you will have just this format.
It is one of the most widely used formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices can also read music in WMA format.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods) is less common.
High-end mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
All you have to do is visit the relevant operator's web pages (or those of another provider) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service alone should be a compelling reason for obtaining a musical motive.
Unfortunately, the operators' offer is miserable and, in most cases, is limited to radio tubes made quickly.
Prices are not the lowest either.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (whether through GSM, internet or even wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always have their own motive.
Every time you want to listen to something, you just have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you've forgotten your MP3 player at home.
It is also important if you still have headphones or handsfree with connection.
If this is not the case, you can use the built-in enclosures, which practically all mobiles have, but a minimum of MP3 players.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The cheapest ones normally cost less than three thousand.
For a price of three four thousand crowns, one can have a walkman already very suitable.
In most cases, however, you will be limited by the absence of an exit for ordinary headphones.
The price of the best telephones and the best tools, also equipped with an entrance for ordinary headphones, does not exceed fifteen thousand.
Readers, on the other hand, have the advantage of having an easy command.
Really anyone manages to control the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the cheapest (cf. our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the resemblance of the command to that of a cassette station, commonly used in the past, or a gramophone, is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of a mobile internet connected by chance, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
The basic models support in principle only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive ones get away even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1,100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, choose specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, so that the ease of control is closer to that of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose walkman series mobiles have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the furthest in this field.
The same service, in the same price category, but with memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) higher, is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is relatively advanced, with operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force conventional operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for long.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz on many occasions the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The Czech Telecommunications Office (ČT), which reported that the price of an SMS was higher for us than for the rest of the Union, confirmed this fact.
Thus, following the latest steps by the European Commission in regulating roaming charges, a paradoxical situation is likely to occur - SMS messages sent from abroad will be cheaper for some Czech mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really like to enter the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, given that we still have three mobile networks and penetration that far exceeds 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČT的), who has stated on several occasions that in the Czech Republic there is no room for another operator, does chorus with the operators.
It is probably true that a conventional operator with his own network is apparently no longer very lucky (indeed, now he would find frequencies only difficult).
However, there is still one possibility - a virtual operator.
It was precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that led to a considerable fall in prices, to which then conventional operators also had to react.
Yet even before parties like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to those heard today in Britain were heard.
However, it became clear that there was still room for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We do not have to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch in Poland of the virtual operator Mobilking.
In just six months, this operator has managed to earn more than 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator in the country.
We should add that behind the Mobilking, there is the financial group Penta, which has among other things the U: fon in Czech.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining the mobile network.
For example, in the world, virtual operators are profiled as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often offset by limited service offerings.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS messages in Britain at least twice as expensive as its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, relying on an unusual target group can also be a good publicity.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"Real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be likely to work at home as well.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesperson for Vodafone, questioned: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmental approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
Especially since it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services. "
In the Czech Republic, no chance, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations are not very promotional.
The launch of Mobilking will rather take place in other countries of our area, "said in a telephone interview for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, spokesperson of the financial group Penta.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were in any case not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything possible to prevent a potential competitor from appearing.
The group GTS Novera, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Telefonika in the field of business customers, has not, for long enough, hidden its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner the better.
We have already negotiated this possibility several times with all Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have managed to make progress in the negotiations, "said Pavel Kaidl Group spokesperson.
The future may therefore be promising.
According to unofficial information, it seems that we might be able to host the first virtual operator already by the end of the year.
But for the time being, its creation is accompanied by complete silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific ones.
For the time being, no subject with a complex and serious project in this field has contacted us, "said Vlastimil Srše的of the press department of Telefonika O2, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with O2's statement: "We have not registered a viable and bilaterally advantageous project so far, which could serve as a basis."
She added: "It is virtually impossible for a virtual operator to appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
In order to operate in such a limited period of time, we should have a concrete agreement now. "
Rather, Vodafone directs its attention to the completion of requests for its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický said about this: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This, in our view, means the most input from the point of view of clients.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to set up a common network for a fast mobile internet. "
Responsible authorities: in tune with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a decrease in prices and therefore to a decrease in their profit.
So what is the point of facilitating such a competitor?
When it comes to their interests, operators know how to understand themselves as thieves at the fair. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U: fon also testifies to this.
The greatest apparent pressure on the ČT, when the U: fon was created, was exerted by the company T-Mobile.
This is borne out by the information available to the public from the ČT's web pages.
Today, the U: fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "Competition in the mobile market has, moreover, recently been amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
Given the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player would subject it, and especially its services, to high demands. "
But given the attitude of mobile operators here, the indifference of Czech regulators seems disconcerting.
It is not, however, just the attitude of ČT, which, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
In the face of this problem, however, the latter adopted its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question concerning the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached at the moment, as the offer of the potential interested parties has a priori not shown sufficient interest for the conventional operators, "explained in response to our question Kristián Chalupa of the External Relations Department of ÚOHS.
Such a statement would not surprise operators' representatives.
But on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than confusing.
All the more so as Kristián Chalupa adds: "Abroad, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the prices of mobile telephone services."
Pressing for an honest functioning of the market and a fall in prices is apparently not in the interests of ÚOHS.
What is indeed shocking is the almost touching concord of the three mobile operators, which stems from their reactions.
The question, if it really is a matter of chance, naturally arises.
Similarly, a fuel price that is strictly identical to all service stations is probably due to chance and the hard fight of competition.
"The Office has not found any signs of anti-competitive behaviour in this respect, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position, and therefore none has an increased corresponding liability for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missing even from the telecoms regulator, "said Chaloupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČT, according to which telecommunications constitute, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators has a dominant position in such a market.
However, some legal experts suggest a different view: for the creation of a virtual operator to be possible, the consent of the network operator must be obtained each time.
And the mobile operator logically has the monopoly on its network.
Thus, it necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of its activity.
Even without accepting this argument, it should be at least worrying for ÚOHS that three mobile operators are visibly proceeding in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in negotiations with all operators.
It is quite common in communications that the ÚOHS washes the hands of the case.
We have already encountered this type of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, the recently adopted Telecommunications Act has not succeeded in bringing about an expansion of the ČT's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many experts promised to improve the situation.
This is something that the ÚOHS representatives need to know very well, but their interests seem to lie elsewhere.
When no one's looking, it can work.
However, the operation of some sort of pseudo-virtual operators, many in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but these are only partially public.
In most cases, firms dealing with multi-level marketing are mentioned.
For example, special mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these firms usually only reach elected representatives.
The magic trick consists in the fact that the company is in front of the operator figure of a classic company customer, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, she gets special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If this happens, it could be a breach of the contractual conditions that we would examine and which could lead to a cessation of cooperation with the company in question," answered our question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
However, it is quite unlikely that any echo of such an activity has reached the mobile operators' heads.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, there may be thousands of customers.
Auncun operator, however, does not object to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring significant benefits to them, and at the same time, as opposed to true virtual operators, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický indicates possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a negligible percentage of customers.
In addition, they are forced to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it, like ordinary customers of mobile operators. "
But this is precisely what should seem strange to ČT.
In addition, there is another question for the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has relatively broad powers to disclose such an activity, and if it does not wish to be satisfied with the explanations of the operators, who claim that they have no idea that this would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer the most expensive country
As we have already mentioned on several occasions, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a considerable fall in the price of services.
However, in virtually all countries where virtual operators appeared, traditional operators were sometimes more, sometimes less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were virtually the same - a market too small, or even too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But it was precisely at this level that the regulatory bodies in developed countries took action, which defended not the interests of mobile operators but those of their customers.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they eventually obtained the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies deal with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is disposed of by transmitting it to a nearby target.
As a result of the experience we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that the confusion in skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But let's not throw the handle after the punch.
If the slide information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at home, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain immune to the rejection (discrimination) of others concerned.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of Czech Citizenship Day, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the national anthem Kde domov mā j (Where is my homeland?).
The hymn was again recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with choir and an instrumental version.
The singing is performed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the anthem arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted Český rozhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret solo versions of singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I was trying to take care that the two singers, as well as the choir, had a good saying, so that we could understand the words, which they sang simultaneously," he said.
Next year, the Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary.
In 1834, the song "Kde domov" was first heard on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovačka (Kermesse des savetiers), an original Czech piece by Josef Kajetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular and people spontaneously adapted it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first verse naturally became an integral part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
The Prague public transport (MHD) will introduce the chip into its ticketing system on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 will be inscribed in the history of Pražský Dopravní podnik (the Pragoese Agency of Transport) as the date on which the first passengers will climb in the metro, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have in their pocket an electronic coupon.
At the moment, it is accessible to about one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard smart card.
Passengers may purchase a voucher 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time have it registered on their smart card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the Transport Agency), located at the metro stations Muzeum, Mřstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letzany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility of buying coupons via the Internet on the web pages of the Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people took advantage of the service this morning.
Those who start using the online store can permanently forget about the kiosks in the subway stations, where they had until now been impatiently trampled in long queues to get paper tickets.
In fact, they will buy their coupon via the internet and they will register it on their Opencard in one of the thirteen Městská knihovna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is at the disposal of passengers a desk with trained staff, who will help them with the purchase via the Internet and, moreover, record the coupon they have bought on their card," said the spokesperson for the project Martin Opatrný.
Besides libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic coupons on the Opencard in vending machines installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, remind the machines to compost the tickets and passengers may have noticed them already in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be eighty," Opatrný added.
Automate will control the coupon instead of the driver
The automates that will work from tomorrow, are easy to use.
Simply introduce the Opencard smart card and the previously purchased coupon will register itself on the card.
The electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
That is, peri-urban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which are used mainly by the inhabitants of the communes of Central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In integrated trains in Pražská integrovaná doprava (integrated transport of Prague), controllers are equipped with card readers, with the help of which they establish the temporary and zonal validity of coupons;" explained the control of tickets Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid, which designs the schedules of the public transport pragois.
Peri-urban buses are equipped with card readers integrated into the driver's car.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the smart card to the driver, but it is also necessary to place the Opencard at the point indicated on the side of the car.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the registered coupons.
"In case the passenger needs to check the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," added Drápal.
Passengers who do not take peri-urban buses and will not remember the expiry date of their coupon, can re-enter the vending machines, which were originally used to record coupons on the card.
It is there, on the screen of the device, that the information concerning the validity of their document will be displayed.
The Sudets were calling for a referendum in the United States.
In 1945, the Sudete Germans called for Šumava to be integrated into the United States.
This follows from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna (The Scientific Library of South Bohemia).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want at least to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
In 1945, certain groups of Sudete Germans were purportedly addressing the President of the United States with such a desire.
This follows, among other things, from a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vědecká knihovna.
Germans from Český Krumlov in the letter ask the US president not to allow "šumavská župa" (forest region south of Bohemia) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation and want to be really sure that the words saying that American troops come to German territory not as oppressors and enemies but as liberators," is written in the letter, signed "People, to whom the fate of Šumava is dear."
Given that membership in Czechoslovakia is supposedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - only brutality, unscrupulous attitude, misunderstanding, oppression and servitude, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take in his hands the protectorate of Šumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would grant this territory to a foreign state to us, which oppresses and destroys minorities and has in no way contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of one quarter of a million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire for revenge of the "Czech oppressors."
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans of Šumava, he would have to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to determine whether his inhabitants wanted to be part of the United States, or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text contained in the letter may, in view of the current knowledge of post-war history, seem somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it is a good illustration of the expectations of the Sudete Germans of the time.
While the Czech Germans had at least to see that the question of their expulsion from the republic would arise, very few of them admitted that possibility.
Some were waiting for the United States and Great Britain to obtain some form of autonomy for the Sudets.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirms this.
During the war, he was, as České Budějovice's German, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, dozens of Czech Germans came to visit him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," Chalupa said.
None of the captured Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war believed that, following the Beneš decrees, they would be expelled from the republic.
You don't think - you pay!
An emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
A way of characterising the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Obebíček believes that it will discourage drivers from engaging in dangerous driving behaviour.
This campaign, costing 150 million, will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and alcohol while driving.
But also remind them to take the belt before starting.
Above all, it wants to touch the consciousness of young drivers, bikers, pedestrians, not to mention professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
This is also reflected in the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you pay!
The sentence "You don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
Then, in a puddle of blood, there's the phrase "You'll pay."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of inattention.
The spots will "haunt" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has been inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
It considers that this will lead to a decrease in the accident rate and in the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
The Sugar and Whip Strategy against Drivers
"What works with drivers is the sugar and whip system.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by saving time when they burn a red light.
Whip is the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be reminded of the drivers, "says Martin Kořán, the transportation psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital.
This is how we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertisements, according to the psychologist.
In his view, signs warning drivers of danger are already less effective.
"When a static sign warning against a hazard is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and drivers will no longer notice it," said Kořán.
Olmert would make in exchange for peace almost all the occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Israeli Provisional Government, spoke out in favour of the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published Monday by the daily Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, even all of them," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will retain a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to yield to the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), since otherwise peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admitted that the possible restitution would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and above all, does not want tractors and bulldozers to crush his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Mount, the sacred and historic places" located inside the Old Town.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be forced to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work, "he said later.
Golan Heights Retreat
Olmert also spoke in favour of Israel's retreat from the Golan Heights, which he believed was an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
That would also require some efforts from Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria solely on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they will have to give up in order to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they will have to renounce their constant support for the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Kaida (terrorist network), as well as that of Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, "said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the stewards in the bus illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is forbidden
In the context of the tragic accident of the Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arises whether stewards and passengers can travel within the bus during the journey.
"If we wanted to respect the law strictly and formally, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old hostess died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the bus path.
At that time, unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had at her disposal two other seats.
The coach may have an accident, or even a sudden brake, also when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the coach is by virtue of its data sheet equipped with standing seats or not.
If this standing equipment is not approved, the passengers shall remain seated.
Student Agency long distance buses do not have standing seats; this was confirmed in Aktuálně.cz by the company manager Radim Jančura.
"This is an issue that we have dealt with with the department and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the washroom during the ride provided they have their own seat, "he unveiled his position.
The law ignores the steward
"There is no unambiguous legal interpretation of the role of steward - there is no legal requirement for that role.
On the other hand, there are also no legal provisions prohibiting the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term "vehicle receiver"; it does not define its rights and duties, "added spokesperson Hanzelka with more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorný, the director of the road traffic department, believes, on the contrary, that the law sufficiently addresses the problem.
"It all depends on whether the coach has in its approval permission to offer standing seats.
It's all in there, "he says.
Buses are divided into urban, with standing seats and limited maximum speed, intercity seats and higher authorized speed, and long distance buses without standing seats with the highest authorized maximum speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on the plane, says an expert
Jaroslav Hořín, an expert at BESIP (road traffic safety) in transport safety, does not see the movement of stewards on board as a major problem.
"On regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of service in aircraft.
Neither is it safe when turbulence occurs and the air hostess can hit her head. "
"However, in the event that the bus has suddenly slowed down, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Same way as in an urban bus or tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of stewards by internal requirements, "he says, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer the services of stewards.
He hires two hundred of them.
Even after this accident, the director does not consider their occupation to be a risky one.
"Nevertheless, as soon as I feel that this is a risky trade, I will remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and newspaper at boarding.
It would also reduce costs, "he says.
The concern for safety is the reason given to the absence of stewards in his vehicles by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We have no hostesses. We have been opposed to this from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident, "he said a year ago in Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has come
A young hostess from the Plzeo region, who had been working for the company for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably tied up the emergency stop strip without using a flashing light and blocked the way to the bus.
The latter's driver tried to avoid it by means of a sudden maneuver, but he approached it by his right side.
Jančura refuses to allow the two seats reserved for the Stewards to be sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company intends to file a complaint against the driver of the truck.
For the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but as regards financial compensation, it also relies on the culprit.
An amendment to the law?
Not in sight
An amendment to the law, which has been being drafted for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details of the movement of stewards on the bus.
"However, it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, she is not too interested in buses, but rather in the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of the mobile at the wheel, "says the expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activity of stewards as something that would fundamentally endanger passenger safety," concluded spokesperson Hanzelka, stating that the control of bus safety is under the authority of the police and the Office for Safety at Work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois rest on Frankfurt.
The big words were not missing in the letter sent by the WestLB Steering Committee to the employees of the house.
By a union of the entities of the Düsseldorf financial institute with the Deka-Bank in Frankfurt, "the central financial market institution of the Sparkasse financial group" could be formed, according to the letter made public on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competency block" coupled with sustainable productivity in such a case.
All in all, such a relationship could be the decisive starting point for further mergers in the banking sector in the Länder.
This is what it looks like when a management committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is still under heavy pressure.
It was not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which, only recently, made it clear to the Government of North Rhine-Westfalia that time was counted in the search for a future solution.
However, for some time now - also on the Frankfurt side - there has been talk of a relationship of some kind between Deka Bank, which knows Sparkasse's customers through their investment funds, and WestLB.
Admittedly the head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas made it clear during the presentation of the figures for the half-year at the end of August that he saw no sense in merging Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a Land bank, whether Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deka Board of Directors, each of which is supported by the banks of the Länder and savings fund groups, has instructed the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the debit of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks have only just begun, it is said in the financial centre.
This is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, has been counting on one of the largest employers in Frankfurt's financial centre when it comes to consolidating the savings fund sector.
In 2003 it was thought for a while that the Deta-Bank could merge with the bank of the Land of Rhineland Palatinate and Halbab.
But nothing came out of this ternary bouquet.
The plans had scarcely been made public that the government of the Land of Hesse ruled against any participation of the Hellaba in them.
Subsequently, the other two houses did not meet either.
The bank of the Land of Rhineland-Palatinate was attached instead to the bank of the Land of Baden-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new deals on the merger of Deka-Bank with banks in the Länder.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had, however, opposed any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, there seems to be a growing feeling that the consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is particularly urgent.
Now that the Bavarian Land's election to Parliament has passed, a BayernLB union with the Baden-Wuttenberg Land bank could be the first to materialise.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure for new mergers were to increase, the potential partners would gradually escape.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she had previously resisted the crisis better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Hesse-Thuringia savings banks and credit transfers group, which owns 85 per cent of the capital of Helaba, secured at the beginning of the year any union with WestLB.
NordLB would still be under control.
Such geo-strategic reflections, however, reflect only one aspect.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can be matched.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive question, which was why the future capacity of banks in the Länder should be ensured, had not so far been resolved by the German group of savings and transfer funds.
In the long run, a WestLb decoding could take place, a decoding which is obviously not desired here.
This is also mentioned in the letter of the current Executive Committee: in any case, a 'global solution' would be envisaged for the establishment.
How all this will be put in the same basket with the union of some entities with the Deta-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, this is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena accompanies him as a girlfriend, and so nothing is the same, he says.
Behind them, close to a five-litre barrel of Kaiser brand beer, stands a well-built beard that shows about 200 beer party visitors what deep sounds his gosier can produce.
Elena hits Luca first, then kisses her.
From Bologna, they came to Verona.
From there, from the bus station near the Puorta nueva station, four buses take the departure this evening at 11: 45 pm, 'destinazione Monaco, festa della birra', arrival scheduled at 6: 30 am.
Three buses are reserved primarily for Italians, in one of the buses travel exclusively from Brazil.
In a corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sing gold and already next to their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also noisy, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for the Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, who wears a long coat lined with fake fur and glasses with wide silver frames.
For the past five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three trips this year alone.
They go there at night, stay all day at the party, and come home at 10: 30.
Spending the night there would involve unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, brewed in accordance with Bavarian purity law, health insurance and a leader of the German speaking group - Marco did a language course in Frankfurt.
And already buses drive in the night on the Autostrada towards' Brennero '.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets quiet on the bus, the passengers sleep.
It's better this way, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while many other buses with Italian registration plates take a break just before Munich, on Highway 8.
When in the early morning Marco's group finally arrived at 6.30 p.m. as planned on the parking lot near Thérèse Square, nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco holds a final speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, to wear the little yellow cap.
Top is written on the left 'Beer Festival', in gothic, and next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency 'conoscersiviaggiando.it'.
Second: "When the doors of the beer's capitals open, we run ', shouts Marco in the early morning.
'Run! 'Run and reserve the seats at the bottom of the tent.
'Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow caps on the same benches, we have to spread them in the room! '
The cup, shouts Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the instructions!
'Show security officers that we're behaving well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone! '
Third: 'Tonight, having come back here at ten and a half hours straight!' Understood?
And that's it, it's going to the beer party.
On the way, someone ties yellow caps to trees to find the way, to signs and even to an election poster of a large Bavarian popular party.
We want to be ready for the return.
It is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no precise figures; we are talking about 50,000 who are going through the Alps and collapsing in the beer stand, 10 percent of the visitors would have come from Italy on purpose this weekend.
The Munich police is reinforced by seven police officers from the South Tirol, by Italian volunteer rescuers who support the Bavarian Red Cross who carry out a statistic on the countries where the Italians occupy first place in front of the British (60 interventions) and Austrian (about 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the brewery Hofbräu.
Nights of insomnia for shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word 'relatively' and slipped that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The Bavarian real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), alongside the DAX, gets a 1 billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect himself from market turbulence.
A person in confidence told Reuters on Monday that aid credits are issued up to EUR 35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate would now have to pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, Depfa's daughter company bears the losses.
According to a newspaper article, the state financier had refinanced himself in the very short term for long-term projects for which he had borrowed money - which has not been possible since then because of mistrust of the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to EUR 2.37 million, and the own capital rate had also slightly decreased from 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were zero compared to the same period the previous year, profits from the allocation of specified receivables and securities as well as the cancellation of provisions in credit transactions had dropped from more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
And it was only thanks to the large profits from the reimbursement of the downstream accounting costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, as well as from the repayment of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Konzern's companies, that the profit deficit of about 16 percent proved to be moderate.
After its privatisation in 1990, the former state financier had initially misspeculated about industrial real estate loans, which had then been filialized to the Aareal bank.
Because traditional state financing was not sufficiently profitable, Depfa had subsequently become more intensely involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of jointly financed projects between private and state investors (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the daughter company, Hypo Real Estate must make depreciation which should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the group's gains and losses, which is still rather vague.
The fact is, the dividends have been cut.
Already for 2007, they had been truncated to two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important state and infrastructure investor since the acquisition of the Depfa.
It is stronger than other institutes dependent on refinancing in the inter-bank market as it has no customer deposits.
With the bankruptcy of the investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of loans between banks has again been considerably tarnished, as banks have accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate needs annually for a part - about 50 Billion Euros - of the total Depfa credits of a short-term refinancing medium.
According to a statement from the Hypo Real Estate, the group's need for financing is covered with medium-term credit and the company is protected from the influence of international financial markets largely out of working order at present.
Other sources say that refinancing would be carried out through the funds until the end of 2009.
The chairman of HRE Georg Funke's Executive Board explained, however, that Hypo Real Estate should no longer have to resort to financial markets in the medium term.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institution for Financial Services Supervision (Bafin) assume that Hypo Real's market capacity is now assured.
The bank's shareholders and creditors can only hope for it.
However, given the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
Moreover, it is not unthinkable that funding should not be used to its full extent.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out either.
After the bank is, according to the latest press releases, still at the door of insolvency on Sunday late in the evening, this temporary rescue will not succeed in reassuring the minds either.
The share price fell from 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are particularly good.
While the debts in the first place have barely moved, the prices of second-hand loans are declining.
The most affected are mainly the investment funds of the former daughter company Württemberg Hypo and those of course with a lifetime beyond 2009.
The bonds of the Hypo Real Estate bank seemed previously to be an alternative speculation investment, now their value must be considered dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the same institute that brought the crisis into the institution by the acquisition of the Depfa bank.
As long as emission institutes, governments and less-affected commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it can be assumed that the arrears will be reduced over time.
Or will happen what no one dares to hope at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the likelihood that safety was approaching has now become a simple and well-founded hope.
This should reserve nights of insomnia primarily to long-term creditors on whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use what they have drawn from to represent a carry-forward of losses for the coming years on the next capital income tax automatically levied on stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop comes to the Tachibana Highschool for the first day, the girls start laughing: German is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new Log of exchanges, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of class in Japan.
What was I excited about?
Already the way to school scared me.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way by myself, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The beginning of courses does not seem to be as strict as in Lower Saxony.
Students appear one after the other from eight o'clock, until nine o'clock minus twenty, a round table starts with the teacher, the home room.
But before the class started, it was up to me to introduce myself.
I don't like talking to people at all, especially in a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old skirt from my host mother, as well as a shirt, blue rising socks and black leather shoes.
In this outfit, therefore, I stood before the desk, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made low masses, laughed and made signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew him because of my mangas.
It belongs to the vocabulary essential to the survival of Japanese teenagers and means "cute, cabbage."
Then I quickly slipped in my place.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she thought it was an honor that the correspondent had to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was pretty quiet, but when the gong resonated, I was assailed by the rules.
Everyone talked to who better, laughed and asked me a lot of questions - in this case, it's pretty hard to understand English Japanese.
During the break, they all took out their Bento.
My foster mother also made me this kind of Lunchbox - it's really something other than the miserable German snacks.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, little sausages, a salad of cucumber and seaweed, fruits and some kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat exactly here in Japan.
Things look weird and taste completely new.
What's for sure is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the confessed salty plums, brrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a boy a Bento which she herself has prepared, and which is then prepared particularly carefully - in the hope of being able to make the boy's acquaintance a little better during the break.
I read that in my mangas.
I'm curious if I could see him here, too.
"Why Japan in particular?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to spend a year at school in Tokyo.
I always said:
"Because it fascinates me, what"
In the end, reading mangas is my favorite thing for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and the culture there, at one point I also started learning Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there someday.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, uses and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is harsh, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen. "
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cockroach runs away from danger, does that mean he also feels fear?
Neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have sensations.
But how can we verify that he feels the same when he behaves the same way as we do?
In the online magazine "Edge," contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, just as we cannot prove that other human beings have consciousness.
But in that case, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and address the issues of feeling or consciousness in general, we enter hard-to-reach terrain because Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he kills, escapes or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, which is why some scientists infer from it a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult to transpose our subjective experience into that of animals.
One aspect is that circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the Prefrontal Side Cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and in the functions of direction and execution).
This vast region is much more developed in humans than in other primates and appears to be entirely absent in other beings.
At least therefore for these aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal Cortex, among which the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from other primates.
Another significant feature may lie in the linguistic nature of man: much of his existence is related to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude the animals.
But even if consciousness were not to depend on language, it would surely influence it, so that animal consciousness, no matter how it is produced, would probably differ greatly from most of our states of consciousness.
This is why it is also difficult to determine what consciousness can look like in other animals.
If this, internal and subjective, is neither measured nor, because of this particular Hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses us great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more readily available scientifically.
Animal consciousness processes could be examined without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happened in studies of short-term primate memory, especially with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick have followed, one focuses more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may or may not be identical.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the prefrontal Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result then for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) takes hold of living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the regions of the cortex that characterize primates and especially Man.
Subtle degrees of feeling, associated with our volubile nature, emerge, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, differentiate and categorize states to attribute them to others other than ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that sensations from primitive activities arise in the regions of the body sensation of the Cortex and the brainstem, as does Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it could be quite involved in any kind of transversal sensations.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict this, but I believe that this cannot be demonstrated.
Pankseep argues that what appears to be fear in both men and rats is probably also perceived to be fear in both cases: how could it be verified whether rats and men feel the same when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach runs away from danger, but what if he feels fear?
In my view, similar behaviour is not enough to prove identical experiences.
Of course, nerve comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but cockroaches don't even have a brain.
But is the brain stem at the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this for man: how could we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably completely different from ours (since the human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour than the emotional sensations of rats.
In all cases, there is progress on the nervous side, as the same is measured in rats and humans.
Since I don't explore the language and consciousness in rats, nor the sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could judge this as short-term, but I'd rather go ahead than hit a wall all the time.
I am indeed a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise, in cooperation with Poland, the European Championships," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun, and there is still a lot to do in both countries. "
In the schedule of construction or destruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts run after the deadline.
The number of stadiums for the European Championship could eventually be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at maximum speed, "said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is constantly watching us."
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
The Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by independent director Robert Zawlocki.
The committee had met at the request of Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN would not be able to act properly," said Drzewiecki of the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter to the President of UEFA, we assured that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League were already convicted in the previous season for maneuvering mandatory relegation; ultimately, the start of the League had to be postponed to the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indignant counter-attack
She wanted to promote a new film, talked about her privacy in an interview - and now has trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has lifted the veil on her ex-adulterine Dennis Quaid.
He's foaming - and counter-attacking.
A late Rose war for the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are engaged in a disgraceful battle - in the sight and knowledge of everyone.
Last week, Meg Ryan spoke in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle about the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful, and it was very painful."
She would have learned of the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his qualification as an unfaithful husband fell clearly: it would be "monstrous," he said to the 54-year-old New York Daily News, "that Meg would once again rehash the history of our relationship and manipulate it."
It would also be "regrettable" if "the pain and upheavals of a divorce for each child were revived again in public" for their common son, aged 16, Jack. "
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
Thus was his answer to the slap: "In any case, my life continues.
I think I'm happy to have a wonderful family that is doing the best. "
Prices of air tickets and hotels fall
In the first half of 2008, hotel flights and nights were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would even be reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would have become profitable again - this is the result of a study by the American Express financial and travel service provider.
The company analysed its bookings data for the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a sharp decline in profits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was clear, especially in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay between 30 and 37 per cent less than a year earlier.
The causes of all this would lie for American Express in the low dollar price that has led to a "desire for declining travel by American tourists."
Financial markets such as Frankfurt or London would also be more affected by lower hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are up 26.3 per cent, the highest in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was up in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the price of kerosene, economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights, which were very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy-class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first class, price changes were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even halved according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would be, on the one hand, declining economic growth, the firm explains.
Demand is said to be giving way to many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be increased pressure from competition under the Open Skies Treaty, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
Sign of the tense situation is the abolition by airlines of unprofitable journeys, as well as the high number of airlines that would have filed the balance sheet in the first half of 2008 - they were 24 airlines in Europe alone.
HSV bat Gladbach 1: 0
With a simple goal and methods, the SV Hamburg becomes first in the classification.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not been able to find a functional eleven.
From Kristoffer Klein. Enlarge. Disaster landing for Marko Marin international player.
The Gladbach player only returned late in the game and his shot failed against the frame of the goal.
His message was precisely formulated, and he came out of his lips persuasively.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger in the hall of the changing rooms of the Hamburg arena.
There wasn't much going on in the locker room, the half-time was over and most had sat down in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, enjoying a great reputation as many former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received in strategic places.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol agreed and lifted the thumb to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
Whose orders seem to have been similar: and let it jump with this second goal!
There was a lack of practice.
"Not everything was very good to see today," Marcel Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhard would have "wanted to be more relaxed as well."
This 1: 0 (1: 0 at half-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit of the head passed by Mladen Petric (at the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," summed up Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate its 121-year-old on Monday.
Already on Saturday afternoon, the fans celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional charts on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to step back," said Marcell Jansen.
He doubted that the intermediate result of the table reflected more the unpredictability of the first League than the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its late recruits - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goaltender Petric as well as Jansen's unbridled FC Bayern - is slowly forming, but it is not yet shining.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," Jol demanded.
After the vote failed
On Wall Street, fear circulates.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan caused the Dow Jones to fall temporarily by 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in a day of history.
Later, the Dow Jones caught up a little.
Around 8: 30 p.m., the largest stock market index in the world was 10.579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology exchange index was 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of the Dow Jones were at that time American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could have earned any more profits.
The shares of Bank Goldman Sachs fell by almost ten percent.
Only a few days ago, the great investor Warren Buffet had partnered with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, resources must be mobilized to buy what is called spoiled mortgage papers.
However, the sum should not be paid at once, but gradually.
In return, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that can be exchanged in conjunction with price developments in order to reduce the burden on the Treasury.
The prices of stock sucked into the whirlwind in Europe and the United States
The billions of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not address investors' concerns.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and draws the Dax to the bottom.
The American Dow Jones Index collapses despite the government's planned rescue of the financial market.
Spectacular declines in the prices of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have led the German index (Dax) to a deep deficit.
The action of the Bavarian real estate financier has lost at times three quarters of its value despite the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank recorded a decrease of more than 20 percent.
The Dax slid well below the large 6000-point psychological bar and stood at 5,839 points with a deficit of 3.7 percent.
All over the world, equity markets have fallen to their knees.
In New York City, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors were concerned that the US government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10.809.25 points lost in the first hour of opening 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The United States House of Representatives intended to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate should follow on October 1.

The commercial and tourism multinational has also indicated that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter influences the theft of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during what is called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
With fuel conductions soon frozen, cryogenic death threatens her.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused disarray among researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a maneuver of space probes, by which they obtain an additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
Thus, probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick, as did the solar probe Ulysses.
This is what has been surprising to researchers for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they are expected according to the venerable laws of gravitation.
More than that, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists could not explain this effect.
They called it the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts feared that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the pull force of matter due to the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study still believes hard as iron that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support using what is known as the dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also close to the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have known the existence of dark matter only for about ten years.
It apparently emanates from it a force of attraction whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
It, on the other hand, is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to scientific calculations, dark matter still represents a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
The tourists abducted in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the kidnapped tourists in Egypt should be released as confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the pre-liberation shooting, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were abducted.
Negotiations for ransom would already be under way.
The Germans are constantly in the collimator of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE depicts the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are visibly free.
This is what Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabija television station and the Italian media have communicated together.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian TV channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages were released.
We're checking their state of health, "Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are doing well and are safe, announced Egyptian national television.
The 19 participants of the desert excursion should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances surrounding a shooting prior to the release of the hostages are still unclear: for example, the kidnappers would have been ready to stop the kidnapping, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army killed six of the kidnappers without shouting.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom, "said the agent.
All that remained was to collect the hostages, "when suddenly" this surprise "occurred.
This Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot dead six of the kidnappers in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" stated that, according to a German mediator, the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the kidnappers wanted to release the female hostages after the ransom was paid.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
Abuse of a father-in-law "who led to suicide"
A court was informed that years of abuse by her father-in-law had led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight counts of indecent assault.
The Truro High Court referred that he regularly linked his daughter-in-law, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years old.
In a letter of confession, Trorise wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
As a child when she lived in Coventry, she had been tied up and banded before forcing her to engage in sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
He and his wife divorced in the '80s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter-in-law went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, a diligent volunteer of National Trust, was haunted by the abuses that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
The Attorney General, Ramsey Quaife, told the court that friends had told that Ms. Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, since 2006 seemed "emotionally dead," and "had lost all hope for life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced the father-in-law of his daughter, who had also written a letter of confession that concluded: "I fastened him and the bishopric regularly."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You're really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrorized, especially at the age of seven.
"This unpleasant saga ended in the suicide of the victim.
And what is even more surprising is the fact that if she had not committed this gesture, her story would certainly never be finished in court. "
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed for years on Stéphanie.
"Without them, she would probably today be a happy, promising, and successful young woman."
Conviction for loss of official data.
The Cabinet Office's ministerial officer, who had forgotten top secret documents on a train in June, will be condemned by the Official Secrets Act, the BBC said.
The man from the Ministry of Defence was on the move when he forgot two highly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents passed through the BBC before being handed over to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any innuendo of criminal intent.
BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would have remained between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
An employee who cannot be appointed is charged with a violation of section 8.1 of the act, that is to say, the safeguard clause.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer be placed under the supervision of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services
The documents he lost contained assessments of Al-Qaeda and the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret location.
Building companies facing the B & B invoice
British construction companies may have to pay an invoice of over £80 million to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of the 2.6 million Bradford & Bingleys savers.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that raise money from savers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles said it is "irritating" to know that companies and their members will have to pay for the broken pots...
The £14 billion loan will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys mortgages are cleared.
But the interest which will increase at the same time, will be debited, each year, to the 700 financial companies that collect the deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in this list.
It is irritating to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously... now have to pay some of the bills of the institutions that were much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is stated that each company must pay a sum in proportion to the deposits it holds, and that intermediary companies must pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interest for the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Committee of Building Companies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It is "irritating" to see that institutions that have behaved cautiously when the real estate market resumed, now have to pay for much less cautious institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, the date of the first annals.
"we need to look at all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to assess the options to be adopted to prevent construction companies and their members from paying this dirty bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interest for 2009 covers seven months, from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, interest will have to be paid for the entire year, which could double.
Since construction companies are organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
Milk increases to five penny per liter
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy announced that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk, by five penny per litre, from Monday.
This is the second price increase, followed by a two-penny increase in February, following research by a consulting firm.
Retail sellers have to decide whether they go in turn, increase the price to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk had last changed in 2002.
Ex-Pm from Bangladesh denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has denied a bail application to former PM Sheikh Hasina, who is in danger of being arrested upon his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to bail him because of his indictment for extorting 50 million Taka ($729,000.00) from a businessman when she was a PM.
This case is one of many charges brought against him.
Khaleda Zia, the forever rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to Bangladesh within a few weeks, but his party, the Awani League, demanded that the country's provisional military government first give him full freedom.
Correspondents pointed out that the terms of her release were contradictory because if she was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they did not see why she could not remain free upon her return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers have announced that she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's claim that she does not require bail because she was allowed to go abroad for medical reasons," said Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will make an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this bail to return to the country in order to prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return after 17 October, said a former Awami party leader.
She was detained last year after the interim military government took over power, but was released in June for treatment abroad.
Sheikh Hasina and Zhaleda Zia deny the accusations against them.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polio campaign.
In Afghanistan, almost 200,000 children have missed the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, said the United Nations.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in all six provinces.
However, she stated that she was not able to contact the children in the dangerous areas of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
A UN spokesperson said that this happened despite the Taliban's promises not to attack or obstruct thousands of nurses during vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the judicial battle of ITV
BSkyB lost its trial following a verdict by the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival transmitter ITV.
The Court of Appeal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Commission stated that, in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement to prevent NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB of ITV's shares cast doubt on ITV's effective independence, prompting the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's boss, Richard Branson, a consumer group and Ofcom's regulator were all against this purchase.
BSkyB replied that forcing it to reduce its shares of ITV would not be reasonable and on the contrary was excessive - especially since BSkyB has just renounced its voting rights.
New investigation in the U.S. Attorney's case.
The US Attorney General appointed a special accuser to investigate the dismissal of nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical of White House officers, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the argument of lawyers that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Accuser, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thereby obstructing justice.
"Serious, unsubstantiated charges of potentially criminal conduct have not been fully confirmed or resolved," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special accuser capable of forcing witnesses to testify was one of his most important recommendations.
The dispute began with the December 2006 cancellation of nine U.S. prosecutors from the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the department had stated that the prosecutors were dismissed because of poor performance.
But it then emerged that the dismissed prosecutors were no more criticized than their other colleagues, which prompted some observers to attribute a political connotation to these dismissals.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others reportedly refused to investigate the accusations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute court cases for the government.
Certainly they can be dismissed at any time, but cannot be dismissed for political reasons.
The head of the justice department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, ended up accused of being involved in this dismissal case, and at the end he resigned.
A number of ministerial officers in the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr Gonzales's role in this case, stating that he considered him to be "primarily responsible" for these dismissals, and ended up "abdicating" his leadership role, "remarkably succeeding in not being involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were critical of not being able to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic will have to be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf, is to be honoured at the Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an Oscar at the ceremony in London next week, has declared that he is "honoured" to obtain this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds was the title of the hit of the 1977 Meat Loaf album.
The evening of the award ceremony is presented by Coldplay, with this year's selection restricted to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things like time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly is one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the United Kingdom as a single in 1979, ranking in 15th place.
In addition, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in the English rankings, and was sold to more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name - has suffered from a health problem in recent years, even undergoing an operation to heal his heart beat that became irregular, after collapsing on stage, in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then we found him a cyst in the vocal cords.
A Dark Street in the City, Often Forgotten, and Can Be Soon in Sale.
New York has hundreds of avenues, boulevards, streets and other parallel roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veteran taxis as well as long-time local residents don't know how to get to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It is about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and resembles a dusty driveway rather than an active artery.
No signs indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to repair Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-time neighbours, have said they are charmed by this shortcut simply because it remains one of the last and oldest streets of the block.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street, has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of neighbourhood landlords' committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay drafted a proposal allowing the building manufacturer to buy the street.
But the committee prefers to keep the street in the city's hands, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local committee manager # 3.
"There are only a few spaces left that belong to the city, and we would like the city to keep Extra Place," she said.
"They could offer to restore it and manage it, which Avalon could do, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install seats there, some of them would be used by a coffee shop to which the builder would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to operate the street, it does not necessarily mean that it wants to own it.
"Avalon Bay's main interest is to remake this abandoned driveway, and make it public," she said, pointing out that it was the city to suggest the sale. "
Seth Donlin, a spokesperson for Real Estate Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, pointing out that the agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical impression.
Some believe that Extra Place has been named after it since 1802, when the inheritance of the great farm of Philip Minthorne's many children was divided, leaving aside this little piece of land, which has remained abandoned ever since.
The back entrance of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened again in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the cover photo of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was beautiful," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of scrap, rags, barrels, posters, leaves and ropes. "
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about the East Village's evolution towards luxury, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble little property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarity - a fragment virtually identical to the city that should be lost in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of Contests: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at A City in the Extinction Process") tells the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The new Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small, narrow, dark shoulder, day and night, and bounded by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and blinds, full of last week's newspapers that fly along the gutters."
With few exceptions, the street always looks the same.
A rat runs agilously at the bottom of the alley, near a door that once led to the CBGB, and which has now become the seat of a chic clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls, an empty 22-ounce bottle of beer, sits next to newspapers that just got thrown away.
A few passers-by said they rarely thought about Extra Place, and suggested its enhancement.
Mr. Field, for his part, suggested that some people underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "took place in dark, damp and disgusting places."
Bilingual Debate: Immersion in the English language
In this part of the Education Supervision Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a former member of California Studies, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "Not as Good as You thought it. Why middle classes should be able to choose their school."
Attracting favors from Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Obama's campaign emphasizes that "African-American and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." This is a truthful fact.
To combat these differences, Obama's education program supports, among many other topics, "bilingual transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends classroom instruction in languages other than English goes beyond his interest in eliminating differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students at this school are mostly Hispanic, with low incomes.
More than a third of the students, many new arrivals, study English.
Of the students of the fourth grade, 100% passed the state exam of math of 2008, expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students took the English-language-arts exam.
This incredible success was achieved thanks to an ingredient other than that advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street relies on analysis, practice, continuous capacity assessment and exemplary attitude.
In addition, and this is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, reports Linda Mikels, head of Sixth Street, this school has introduced the English language training "full immersion."
Total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Miss Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, told me "we had a huge success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico, 12 months later, if you went without her class, you would have had no chance of identifying her."
"It works," she observes, "it worked for us."
Should Obama not take the example of Sixth Street Prep and replicate it in the other schools composed mostly of Hispanic students learning English?
The excellent results achieved by this school speak for themselves; but the policies on education within his party (the Associations for National Education have long supported bilingual education) and his enormous support for bilingual education obscure the prognostic of Obama's response.
Although he is in favour of the fact that immigrants learn English, Obama recently saw this as insignificant, when he proclaimed that we must all stop polemicizing the wording of English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he said," you have to make sure that your child speaks Spanish. "
If Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should carefully consider the models of education that work, rather than disdain them or consider them insignificant.
Nette du Pétrole fall following the New World Economic Enquiries
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for the financial markets will succeed in giving life to the economy.
The futures of crude oil, fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel. The New York Mercantile Exchange, during this morning's sales.
Prices have fallen by over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After rising to $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 per barrel this month, before rebounding again in the face of the deep uncertainties in the financial markets.
This Monday, investors are once again concerned despite the agreement on the largest rescue plan in history reached this weekend by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be protracted.
In the very last episode of this financial disaster, "Citygroup will purchase the banking operations of the Wachovia Corporation, said the government this Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourgish governments nationalised the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that this weekend's frantic negotiations, concluded with the rescue agreement, "seem to have failed to revive the market."
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to slow down.
"the outlook for global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors. "
"we believe that raw materials cannot escape this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand the extent to which the American virus would spread globally and in particular, in China."
The Bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, given the fall in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, were therefore forced to decrease by 20 percent, oil and gas price forecasts for 2009.
The festival of the Second Time Determinant for the Improvement of the Team Record.
After spending more time in the last eight seasons than anyone in Jets Shaun Ellis uniform, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was watching the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," Ellis said.
The second time started after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played dirty under dark clouds.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre managed to make a pass at Laveranues Coles allowing a touchdown of 12 yards, a warning sign of an afternoon during which their relationship jumped forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns, the first when a corner back fell and the second, 10 seconds from the half-time.
"I didn't get out of my zone" Favre said about all his passes to Coles.
"he's a mediocre player."
"We communicated extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Coles played wrestling, the defense beat the Cardinals quarter back, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the ball escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, may well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this possession for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking a 34-0 advantage.
That was the best the Jets could have scored in a while.
"The coach of the Jets, Eric Mangini, who was asked to describe this madness, said" the second time or the third time? "
When both of them were told - the Jets dropped 21 indisputable points in the third time- Mangini said: "I can tell you that I liked the second time more than the third.
"Many points were scored in a short time."
Gebrselassie rested, surpasses his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, an Ethiopian, once again proved to be worthy of his title as the best cross-country runner of the century, after beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win in 2: 03: 59 of an accommodating race on the plate, Gebrselassie beat his record of 2: 04: 26 last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
At 35, Gebrselassie won the 26th world record of his superb career in which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance from the 1600metres of the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing - perhaps exaggerated in today's eyes - that air pollution would increase his asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny weather, 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees behind - Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted into cross-country runners, have contributed to the reduction of the marathon record by more than two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2: 06: 05.
After Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters, having suffered cramps two weeks before, and having missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to remain brilliant, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I got back to it last week, and today I had doubts; but in the end, everything went for the best. "
He was accused - especially in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - of having orchestrated his races too much, avoiding the world's marathon stars, actually counting on hare as if they were in a track competition, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie's abilities as a cross-country runner.
Sunday Gebrselassie, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1: 02: 04. halfway.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the headlines disappeared.
A little more than three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie made his final climb to detach from Kwambai, who finished second in 2: 05: 36, improving his top personal record by five minutes.
Kamathis came third in 2: 07: 48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now a German citizen, finished a remarkable year getting the seventh time of 2: 19: 19.
The English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2: 15: 25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone winning the London Marathon in 2: 24: 14.
She could not participate in the Beijing games because of a hypothetical back pain, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record by almost five minutes.
She ran with a skilful strategy, allowing the Ethiopian and Kenyan group of riders to take a great advantage, then surpassing them about 18 ½ miles later.
Askale Tafa Margasa of Ethiopia came second in 2: 21: 31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, finished third in 2: 25: 01.
In a City Partly, Pride and the Experiences of Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience arise.
"Eatonville, the first completely black town to integrate, a childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple to do nowadays." The city with five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 dark skins, 300 good swimmers, full of guava, two schools and no prison. "
It has now become a city of pilgrimage
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora Festival in Eatonville to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in a variety of ways, the city she describes has become a tourist because of its inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression - era Federal Writers' Project- remains a special place.
It is as independent, dignified, and private as it was already in the 1930s, when Hurston said that the black rural population of Florida was often reluctant to share their true thoughts with the white man, who "knows us so little, does not know what he is losing."
Even though this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has indeed invoked an open dialogue on the theme of race, many here remain cautious from the foreign perspective.
"We are very careful about how to tell the story," said 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a long-time resident and the oldest parishioner in the city.
"it must be in line with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and fighting.
It represents both a historical model of a black power grab and a community of almost 2400 people with poverty rates twice the national average.
This is a central point, but also an example of a Southern black rural culture - sometimes disdainful, sometimes acclaimed - which recalls the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in Eatonville's image born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the world through sincere books full of dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just outside Route 17, a road that crosses the often forgotten central Florida that ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
Such an astounding cashier in life as in literature, Hurston led the readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided into several private parts.
"past the road to the left," she writes, "you will find the modern brown and white public school, with its well-preserved gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he can barely read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can be used by passing people.
So, in just a hundred words, Hurston associated Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora described the reality well, "said 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's young girls who Hurston immortalized, quoting the colorless songs, performed by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people did not like it."
Hurston is always remembered as a lively and eccentric person who frequently returned after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston usually arrived in town without warning, aboard a big Chevrolet, a cigarette in the mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional clothes.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many laughed at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he also adds, swinging in his chair of the rear patio that overlooks Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in some tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no major commemoration, no plaques for the general public.
I don't think they understand the contribution or legacy it offers the world, "said Valérie Boyd, author of" Wrapped in Rainbows, "a 2003 Hurston biography.
A crucial moment came in the 1980s.
Public servants in Orange County wanted to move a five-lane highway into town to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already pushed Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made as Eatonville recovered from a difficult period in his history.
Forced integration, among many other things, has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led hatred to the community's door.
"At that time, a bunch of young white people came to throw oranges or objects at people sitting on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They threw a watermelon out of their car. "
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's request for forced integration, defining his decision in Brown v. Board of Education "insulting rather than glorifying my race."
Residents now claim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some aspects, has diluted Eatonville's cohesion and weakened young people's confidence.
"Black children used to be kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and in the evening too," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins as well as Chief Director of the Eatonville Community Protection, a non-profit group.
This lasted, she added, until teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's blander- I mean, there's a cultural demarcation line here," said Ms. Nathiri.
Civil rights, moreover, have created space for many more Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, such as her, armed with joyful self-confidence and policies such as: "how can they deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company!"
It's beyond me. "
In 1975, writer Alice Walker visited Hurston's anonymous grave and began to struggle to revive his reputation.
Five years later, a biography acclaimed on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The highway project arrived just when the most famous girl in Eatonville had regained her appeal.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors consider her a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the storyline rejected the highway proposal.
"The fiasco of the five-lane highway, extremely fast, a true civic pride," said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd summarized the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the highway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-resident people, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and the residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been listed as a historic city since 1998.
In 2006, a mono-theme library (of course known as Hurston) opened on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, repaved.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time consider itself a back street on a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(there are 90 percent black people today)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Eatonville, its raison d'être, are still treated with caution.
Permission must be sought for most interviews, and certain things - such as the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, depicting black men in the countryside - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Miss Jones, a courageous teacher who has a faint fad for bright red, are always afraid that their island community will be well understood.
However, with the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride has emerged.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered his entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, neither better nor worse, but as proud, creative, hard-working, crazy and mixed as other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is the sincere civic affection heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the younger ones, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins of Winter Park, seem to have learned the description Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, who pass through this area, will think:" oh, this city has not compared anything to others "Alondra Kenon declared after Mass last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate history, it is a very beautiful city. "
Here in New York, everyone speaks finance fluently.
Nevertheless, nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan kept away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they're in the eye of the cyclone.
Never could they think that in the glass and honeycomb offices above their heads, bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York, spend the worst "working day at the office" since the crack of 1929.
The delivery agents continue to sneak onto the sidewalks, with their carts and muffin trays for morning meetings.
The latino always hang between residential buildings carrying, like mules, about fifty luxurious shirts hanging from a yoke placed on his shoulders.
Office workers continue to line up to buy their morning sandwich from street vendors, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4: 00 p.m. and 7: 00 p.m. on weekdays.
I had not felt the crisis despite the completely pessimistic accounts until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I had planned to work late in the afternoon, as I discovered at my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, about 20 people in line.
Not in front of cashier's desks, or to withdraw from the cash or make a payment, but in front of customer service's desks, where the usual customers ordered their checkbooks, the tourists asked for direction for the Macy store, and the new customers opened accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorized personal banker," were all in line for the same reason as me.
Not the same way, because they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They withdrew their money from savings accounts called thrifts (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings banks and their subsidiaries that operate only in one state, and say they treat customers like their families.
In the recent past, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a $327-dollar capital bank, has used the bankruptcy trustee, and as the New Yorkers returned home for the weekend this Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with savings accounts worth $440 million, desperately sought a buyer to save her.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, scared of another potential debacle, have transferred their money to a bank that they believe is reliable, the one that's doing the most rescue on Wall Street.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I was hearing a lady at my local Chinese supermarket, talking on the phone to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and her meagre general manager Dick Fuld, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the janitor in uniform at my building, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the deliveries of my fruit and vegetable merchant.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Muslim tombs desecrated as Austria swings to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who abandoned the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organisation of the "cities against Islamisation" in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They wear road signs depicting mosques striped in red.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of desecrating an Austrian Muslim cemetery on the weekend of the victory of right-wing extreme political parties in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun cemetery near Linz between Friday night and this morning; according to the police, this is an organized action.
The criminals painted Jewish symbols on several graves, such as the Star of David; however, the detectives believe that this could have been done to disguise extremist hatred of Muslim immigrants.
Could this accident be somehow linked to the elections?
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community said that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this desecration, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan, which is nearing its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of regaining its courage, following its oscillation to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, which took almost 30 per cent of the votes, carried out an anti-immigration campaign; some of their slogans were even considered, according to critics, to be xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against wearing the headscarf and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to alaha food.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European fraternity" to avoid the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and minarets, proclaiming that they would constitute a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections, defined the extreme right as the strongest political bloc in the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who made the difference, because they worry about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is forbidden to travel abroad.
The courts have banned glamour rock star Gary Glitter, accused of child sexual abuse, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he expressed his intention to visit Spain through France to the authorities that controlled him.
The Kent police imposed this travel ban last Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at the hearing in Ashford's limited courts, but was still represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the court said "Thursday, September 25, in Ashford Court, Kent Police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd wasn't there then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, even though he was registered on the list of accused of sexual abuse.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
He must also inform the police, 7 days before his expected departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he could serve a sentence of up to five years' imprisonment.
Kent Police stated that they would not discuss specific cases or potential movements of Glitter in the county.
A Kent Police spokesperson said, "Kent Police will do everything they can to protect our children like those abroad.
"In our view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, much more effectively.
"protecting the people of Kent is the most important intention of the Kent Police, and we are closely monitoring the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the area, in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls, aged 10 and 11, respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have had to board for a flight to London.
But he declared that he was not feeling well, and refused to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him from controlling the passports, and in the end he left for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused him entry into their territory, and was therefore forced to return to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted that he return to England.
He finally arrived at Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge Court of Limited Jurisdiction, West London, for registration in the list of persons accused of sexual abuse, as Scotland Yard requires.
In the past, Glitter had already been served a four-month sentence in the United Kingdom for holding images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
No heels, no stuffed clothes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in these moments unknown to the general public, where we discover at intimate gestures and stolen looks artists who do not care to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" the theatricality of some plays with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of the artists.
In this project, the photographer takes the particular iconography of flamenco from different angles.
Included in the Flemish Photography Month program, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco - people" "may be anyone but, after seeing the photos, the observer realizes that these are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on stage passion, sadness, joy... by captivating the public.
In order to capture moments of personality of these artists it is not necessary to make pictures on stage.
They have their own personality and character.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera moments of personality of flamenco stars. "
With the festival "Chant populaire des Mines," Bauer started a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and equipment, remind classical photography.
The implementation of different stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises each day."
It is not about dancing or singing per se, but about the personality and character of the artist who captivates the public with his art.
The search for essentials and magic has been the constant of this work that we present these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco stars such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are part of the selection made from about seventy artists photographed.
The project has turned into an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book collecting the portraits exhibited in the gallery.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "Portraits of old sportsmen" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people," the photographer admits that he loves to photograph the portrait of people, to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a more or less long time.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You're in front of people, characters you sometimes don't know, or who only give you a few minutes to take a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true. "
This collection of portraits of the present flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - people," is on display at the Galerie El Fotómata, located at number 20 of the rue de la Mata (street parallel to the Peupleraie d'Hercule) which will be open until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true audacity"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again Mario Vargas Llosa is determined to advance the new project on which he works, a novel whose main character is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and who passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize winner of Literature confessed yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently occupies him "is a real daring" and that "everything shows that he should not write it."
"If I were reasonable, I would not, but I will do it and I hope to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas and thoughts which for four days saw a parade in the city of the aqueduct of hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most anticipated character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award in the majority of the participants' voices, made room full at the Juan Bravo Theatre.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, found himself faced with a fascinated audience who did not see the past hour when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and a great dose of humour, traced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "his thirst to read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote in a "very methodical way" thanks to an intense work of documentation, correcting and rewriting part of the text to face his "lack of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspired his novels.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, a ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people less alike," because writers were asked "not to let frivolity go" and to assume their vocation.
The bad weather is ruining the Pozoblanco fair
The party of the banners that concluded the bull races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse bulldozers verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organizing committee, in agreement with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Léonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the bull race.
The bad of the weather was hard on this fair, since finally two out of three parties could not take place.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bull race.
On the poster were José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who should have fought in the arena of Castilblanco
So only the Friday party took place
On Friday, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and was carried in triumph, after making arm movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banderilles planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the exposed gradins applauded more than his fight in itself with the bull.
Worse for El Juli, who has entered the Los Llanos arenas without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he was whistled by most of the audience.
Police control of a van in Alava province: two thousand kilos of hashish found
Five o'clock minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (the Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two occupants of a van and the latter two begin to flee.
His load, more than two tons of hashish, enough to stop them.
The police prosecuted them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A.J., according to information disclosed by the Interior Department of the Basque Government.
The arrested individual was charged with drug trafficking and document forgery.
The incident took place when various officials of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a check of the vehicles on the N-1, at the border of the Municipality of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed orders, suddenly accelerated and control began.
The police began their pursuit until the vehicle stopped two kilometres further on the side, where the two occupants descended to flee into a wooded area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the Iveco Daily van.
The posterior part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish balloons. Then, they proceeded to transfer it to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drugs.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "falsified" since it did not coincide with the one on the van's registration, which is also why they charged the detainee with an offence of falsifying documents.
The Ertzaintza continues its investigation to arrest the other suspect, who managed to escape and to determine the source of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old inmate, A.A.J., was taken into custody to complete the various procedures and will be tried within the following hours.
Actress Heather Locklight arrested for driving under the influence of a drug
The actress Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the TV series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara, California for driving under the influence of a drug.
A witness saw her doing strange maneuvers trying to get out of her garage in Montecito, according to what a California police patrol spokesman revealed to People magazine.
The witness stated that at about 4: 30 p.m. Locklear "pressed the accelerator hard, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the garage, and going backwards several times, she rolled on her sunglasses."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who initially did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear stopped in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
That person, at that time, called the emergency department because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," that's why the officers took her to the drug and alcohol center to do a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and alcohol abuse was ruled out from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug."
Locklear was arrested being suspected of driving under the effect of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated at approximately 19.00 hours and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear came out of the Arizona clinic where she was interned to treat herself with a nervous breakdown.
Llamazares asked the Andalusian federation of the United Left to assume its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to take a decision on the case of the former Youth and Sports Councillor of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being accused of doing preferential treatment for his family members.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organisation that will have to shoulder its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the behaviour of the political party that he will have to adopt in the Seville City Council.
However, the leader of the United Left has called for the investigations to show "transparency" for irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The United Left has always defended such cases so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all civil servants."
"Mayo Sangre," Garci's daring bet
Drawing on the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous Spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de mayo," which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly €15 million in budget.
The filmmaker tried to "stage the many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film lasting more than two and a half hours, "Sangre de mayo" will be released in the cinemas next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
A great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci assures that he realized with this shooting "a dream of a child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who three years ago commissioned him to shoot a commemorative film for the two hundred years of May 2, Madrid, which he always accepted when the story was based on national historical facts.
The €15 million provided by the Madrid Commune is for Garci a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the appropriate decorations and clothes the atmosphere of "a Spain that has been wrong leader for the fight, since, the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellions under the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding for the films "Captain Alatri" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double that obtained for "Sangre de mayo" - because he could not shoot a few scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he collaborated for almost his entire career.
The filmmaker of "Volver a empezar" influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he used to rehearse before starting the filming and to whom he does not cast, since it seems to him "humiliating" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theatre and the cinema to keep himself informed."
Many actors in "Sangre de mayo" repeat in front of the camera, like Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Four times Oscar candidate (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films that represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Sangre de mayo," Seven French billiard tables "and finally the winner," The blind sunflowers, "are not representative of the young Spanish cinema," which would deserve to be better known, "he said.
With this movie Garci does not expect at a price.
"At first you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you work only for prosperity, and now you just make one more film," says Garci after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón puts herself in the skin of the sevillane dancer Tórtola Valencia
A Sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a Sevillane dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in Triana and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life as a pioneer in the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf and Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and pleaded for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of dance in Europe between the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she offered me to perform the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia and it seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we are not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "butterfly dance" made me think of a Cuban popular dance and "snake dance" to some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was the same as hers, "she says.
The staging was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabela again in one of his performances, as he had done at "La puerta abierta"; and that of Professor Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to collaborate with her student.
"Matilde turns Tórtola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me. "
The staging was also done thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, el Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this kind of artists who were considered divas."
This work also tells, in a way, the life of this woman who exhibited herself in places so far away, especially for the time, as in India, the United States, or Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think it is these women who have a huge influence in their times and now no one knows and highlights her work," says Bayón.
The show will begin at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre
The publication of the "Journal of a newly married poet" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of a newly married Poet" in St. Stephen's Church in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the republication of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: This Poplar of Light" which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling in the various Andalusian provinces, will go to New York during the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia bought eight hundred copies of the "Journal of a newly married poet," edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America less pleases without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was one of them. "
This phrase is by actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Absence of Malice," and illustrates well the despair of American cinema, and of the whole of America, in the face of the striking idea that Newman is no longer of this world.
He had trouble getting an Oscar
It hasn't been running since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard blow for everyone.
"Sometimes what one feels goes beyond expression, and now I have lost a great friend," Robert Redford cried, "my life and my country were better because of his existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool of himself or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of cinema and motherland died during a particularly dark period, when terrorists and stock markets are frightening, the esteem of Americans has fallen very low, desperately seeking motives of dignity.
When times are so hard and without reason to live, only admiration remains for human beings and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He represented for everyone an ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of his elder deceased after an overdose and the creation of his own brand of organic food.
It was a victory for a country that struggled against a suicidal food crop.
This expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without paying attention to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, the oscarized Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was the culmination of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He set us the high bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today trying to break through the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious privacy and far from the goals.
It's still not easy or possible in the media jungle these days.
But there's the one trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful even though he did not lack the opportunity to be faithful.
"But why should I eat a burger out of my house if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to joke.
In heaven, he attends with pride to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so usual in America.
"Among all the great roles he has played, he has never been more proud than the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring and philanthropic grandfather," he says.
Madrid in the race for the 2016 Olympic Games
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after the failure in 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race: we are not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever been in.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would be subject to an eliminatory note.
But let us look at everything in detail and from the beginning.
Errors begin with the withdrawal of the bibs, which forces you to go ahead.
It's not bad, but if they move you it would be better if they gave you everything (including the electronic chip for the races).
Well, no.
They made you go there only to take the backrest (first mistake, move only for this) and (after a long queue) surprise!, there was only the size 'S' for the jersey (second mistake, because I need an XL size)
What world do we live in?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small jerseys with less fabric and the cheap blow?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on race day.
Apart from the fact that you have to go there very early to remove the electronic chip, the queue is 15 minutes and, moreover, you have to leave your backpack at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, this is incomprehensible since 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long queue, the competitions started and we hadn't left our backpack at the entrance yet, although once done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait of more than 40 minutes during which the rebellions and assaults of the house took place.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be included in the classification with the exact time, because of the chip they gave me that I think did not mark the departure properly.
Of course, if they asked me to quote an example of a perfect race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the host city for the 2016 Olympics.
Microsoft looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the conference on Emerging Technologies of MIT Microsoft was presented a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence endowed with little intelligence but able to accomplish some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to travel on the company's campus) in response to what was asked of him during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in the place, who they are - including remember what positions they occupy - and listen to and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asks him if she is here to visit someone and tells him that she will answer him in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week we talked in addition to a change of strategy at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and it will no longer have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the necessary instead of unnecessary applications, they would go five times faster.
This represents a discovery since Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change of strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system is losing importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who adhered to the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on the part of Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for understanding hardware and software.
He's in the same position as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operational system must be seen not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operational system but more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer is only turned on to run Firefox, Explorer or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than browsing windows.
Who serves half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the most can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, month cluttered, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services so that they finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need that, indeed, and I am setting an example for you.
The photo presented in this article, was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the beverage dispenser, a poster asks them to use their own research tool - "Your Research. Our Future."
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be released in early 2009 but towards the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But because Android's launch is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them a lot.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso endorsed him on the French Riviera, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's' Blood Diamond ', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's' Godfather 'and is part of the holding of the association of muscular gays.
And if we start enumerating all of his appearances, we could also quote this strong mustachu who was raising weights in a walking circus.
It's not just a men's cotton, moulding and sleeveless jersey.
The English call it 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all the others.
First of all, by its flamboyant name - although it is known as' Marcel '- which has to do with sport since it takes the name, according to legend, of boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
The 'Marcel' is distinguished from the others by its excellent cotton, its unisex cut, its distinctive logo and the small Belgian flag (barely recognizable) that the best known body jerseys have in the neck.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tank tops.
But it also produces sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's a shame to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to become a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take very seriously their new activity in fashion.
Monica says they're not just beautiful, famous girls who lend their names.
It was present at the Mango brand's promotion in Paris at its new headquarters but also at the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house sponsors.
Monica is warm and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I created for Mango for the new autumn-winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honour of Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinema of the 1950s and 1960s enchants us and we draw much inspiration from it for our collections.
I like to walk around town and watch women see how they're dressed, how they combine their clothes, I do it often.
Dancer, actress and cartoonist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was a little girl, I liked the clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to look in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my way of dressing.
Dancers like to dress well for classes and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you put on the clothes that's when you really get into the character's skin.
So everything is connected.
You didn't have 30 years ago: was it hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30 years rejoice.
I think the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoys life with less trouble.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was a kid and it has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, you think you're gonna be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mom because my body is asking me to, and besides, I want to be a young mom; I don't want to lose that.
As far as the candidate is concerned, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Let's get to the movies, you're waiting for the different movies you shot last year to come out.
It's true, I can't wait for them to come out.
As a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like to have everything now but of course it is not possible.
I can't wait for the films' La última hora 'and' En busca de la tumba de Cristo 'to come out.
Seeing what you'll think of it...
A few days ago you started on the bridge with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I didn't get on the bridge to make the model.
Simply put, Naomi Campbell called me, I've known her for a long time, to invite me to participate in London in a charity parade for her association in support of women and the clothes we exhibited - I exhibited two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold at auction to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender-hearted person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Besides, this good side of Naomi fascinates me.
She asked me to march for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to do the pear tree, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for women in the Third World.
Recurrent drinkers will have to install the 'alcolock'
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver, who has had more than three administrative sanctions for blood alcohol, to have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the vehicle from starting in a state of intoxication, or if he does not breathe.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now reflected in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project lasting one year.
Its aim is to rehabilitate the driver by offering him road rehabilitation courses.
The Minister of State in charge of road safety and also the Directorate General of Road Safety and the Technological Institute for Motor Vehicle Safety Foundation will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in a state of intoxication, take back the car.
Alcolock would avoid this since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the alcohol level in the breath and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol level is higher than that allowed.
It costs more than €1,000 and is the responsibility of the driver.
In this respect, a study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device reduced up to 65% of infringements in the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save 115 lives every year.
This applies only to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with such behaviour before it becomes criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be carried out through ordinary channels, but reform through criminal channels requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have one on an experimental basis.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote for an initiative of the Spanish Socialist Party which proposes to install this system in school buses as has been done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 1740, the official scheduled time, the plane of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the eve of setting, but its rays still required a visor to see the royal couple coming down from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier I asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to finish their official trip.
- Ah, all right, so we won't be able to go to the airport to pick up customers at this hour... are you from here or...?
- No, no, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Princes of Asturias are and knows the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and in a military row composed of 27 navy soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in navy blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is dressed very sober and does not wear her usual peep-toes; perhaps they told her that a storm was threatening.
They make a brief stop with the photographers before passing through the room where the official procession awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four biggest hotels in the city, a funny journalist from Mexican television is waiting for them.
The most prestigious prize of fashion
There is surely no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion prize than Paris and there is surely no living cartoonist more extraordinary and good live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, in order to strengthen the international image of new fashion talent.
The winner will be awarded a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her models in Mango's showcase at 54 boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Of course it is the second largest store of the brand in Europe that has just been inaugurated with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylist Valentino, president of the jury of the contest, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having big on the heart and doing against bad fortune good heart, because of the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a Mango garment and some ELAH trimmings, which cut off the breath, and arm on it, arm under with his son Luis - a handsome man almost two meters high - she accompanied Valentino to her dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, and the Baron de Rotchil finished the evening without a jacket because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with trousers and a shirt - from her own collection - and who for dinner transformed herself by endorsing a sexy and black long dress, moved when during the night tour of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ballet rehearsal room and remembering the good old times, she grabbed one of the bars and made the gesture of a 'big fold'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the visit of the outbuildings of the palace, but she showed us photos of her son on her mobile phone before.
The following morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez - another handsome man travelling on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having asked beforehand, that there should be no odours in his room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh, that's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are not only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to top it all, they are all listed in a book that will bring relaxation to booksellers on September 30.
The morning alarm almost saddens us when it rings every morning at 7: 00, but it is worse when we think of the restless rhythm that the present life imposes on us.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer with back pain.
Stress represents the evil of the 21st century.
But there are neither one nor two methods to combat daily fatigue and work-related problems.
Well, 1001, neither more nor less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of methods adapted to everyone's taste and time.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and will arrive at booksellers directly from the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to obtain tranquillity in relationships like work or through personal relationships, this' manual 'denies such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not run through your veins to restore your body's balance and stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the couch, disconnect from your mind and focus on reading.
Talk while sleeping
A few kids talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very awakened by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time this happens may surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called sleepiness.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Sure there's more than one talking at night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadically (once in life, for example, associated with a high fever episode), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep alterations such as nightmares, night terrors, night lurks (pee in bed) or sleepwalking, but this is not always the case.
As we have said before, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress or overexcitation.
Anyway, it's a little under-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurs or, on the contrary, with cries, cries, long speeches...
In the event that sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to see if there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation for this problem.
We have said that it is a benign alteration, which is why there is no treatment, unless it is related to another sleep alteration that can be cured (for example, if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have difficulty relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm down internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as somniloquies appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'd wake him up.
Even if he talks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if he is very anxious several times, it is advisable to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not be tempted to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because when he sleeps, he's not conscious to be able to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming of, so be careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Never tell the child that you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
It causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern finally found the way to victory on his field after a long period of scarcity.
Without making a big match, the Jouns and Blacks created the greatest number of opportunities and managed to transform one for the win of the game.
The pace was not very strong during this meeting, when the attackers had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by visitor captain Kauffmann who was close to the dormer on a shot from afar, Illhaeusern was going to take the ascendant slightly and in turn Fonderflick from afar, then with Hirn above, Romain at the end of the foot or Diebold came to tickle Dannemarie's defense.
On the opposite side, we were making block in the middle of the field and we just left the stirring Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half was to be decisive with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousiens by Marais, well positioned to take back a ball pushed back on a first attempt by Diebold (53rd ').
But the drummer will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose any big problems to an Ilshousian Eleven who just retreated a little to "compass" his defense, except in the very last seconds of the game where, after a big scramble, the ball passed very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy meets angered fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a detour through Brittany.
Faced with the demonstration of strength of the fishermen who severely disturbed on Monday the access of several Breton and Norman ports, the president of the Republic decided to go Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to meet their representatives.
They promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hoped that he would "come with concrete proposals."
A presidential visit which falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by the Breton fishermen to obtain measures in the face of rising diesel prices, which reached a record of more than €1.14 per litre on average.
According to Elysée's spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies regain competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration of seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted snail operations in Morbihan and Calvados, causing plugs of almost 10 km.
The Quiberon marina was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not stopped.
A filter dam has been set up on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, as demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic façade and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne, in Vendée, where trawlers stayed on wharf, or in Le Havre, where some 20 boats blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique, stopped the blockade of the major Total refinery in Donges in the evening.
Those of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" must decide on Tuesday on the follow-up to the movement and on its participation in the planned interview at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but estimate that the profitability threshold of a vessel is reached only with a diesel less than €0.30 per litre.
Paul Newman the beautiful
The unforgettable performer of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession on the world economy.
The fourth world aviation manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer hopes very much for the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider divesting more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the US monetary authorities have bailed off, plans to divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its business beyond its international life insurance and retirement business in the United States, says the newspaper that quotes sources close to the file.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible assignments, according to the FT.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG plans to separate include its airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurer, and its real estate portfolio and investments in private equity, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these assignments, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly make cash to repay the $85 billion Federal Reserve loan at the risk of US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting the current shareholders' share.
Analysis Paris History of the meeting Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange experienced a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson bank rescue plan: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the biggest drop in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index yielded 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the sitting, Wall Street collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan, which was intended to restore some stability to the markets.
By 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives refused Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"This is a bad signal to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was counting on this," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would arrive "too late."
"If the project is indeed moribund (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the US central bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would further tighten the credit conditions," warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, "every day that passes brings the fall of a financial institution" in the United States, said Ms Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organised the acquisition of Wachovia's banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, pushing for emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are facing "not only an American crisis, but also a global crisis," added FTN Financial's analyst.
The bond market has grown strongly.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill declined to 3.632%, from 3.827% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4.161%, from 4.357% the previous day.
Obama, winner at the points of the first TV duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two White House candidates succeeded another to find out who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, won it.
Not surprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this TV duel, which would have been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, has not been "brilliant" enough to stop his decline in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion poll published on Saturday gave Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes that it was the democrat who pulled his pin.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones who count, Obama has won for 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them give McCain the victory, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his advance on Thursday with the good performance expected of his roommate, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She has good instincts, "said Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seven-year-old McCain has consistently highlighted his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while highlighting the "naivety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that..." he has accused several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president," he also assured.
An angle of attack hammered since yesterday in Republican TV commercials.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without disassembling, he was concise and precise.
He emphasized his ability to make the right decisions, and to restore the image of the United States to the world.
"McCain still has not understood, while Obama, so," replied, this weekend, a democratic spot accusing the Republican of not having fully appreciated the impact of the crisis on the "American street."
"During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered for an election meeting in North Carolina in a blatant rain.
He did not even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial misguided clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans to be the most able to save the economy on the brink of the precipice.
"The coming week could be a turning point," the influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration official, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current debacle "is the final eight-year verdict of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain."
Reiterating that he would still be able to cut taxes by 95% of Americans despite Wall Street surges, the Illinois Senator also pointed out that achieving the country's potential energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was his first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain wanted to build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudent, the two candidates dodged questions about the $700 billion (€470 billion) financial rescue plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you notice that there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the legislative elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusian citizens met on Sunday evening as soon as the polling stations in central Minsk square were closed to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislative system.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation."
Some people admit they didn't even vote: "What's the point, as they will do what they want with my voice," said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has been good for foreign observers in order to resume language with the European Union is ready to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers to be clean.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting," said Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," says Alexandre Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the voices, and at home, it is the executive.
If opposition deputies enter parliament, they will have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "dialogue with the European Union must begin.
For if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the vote.
She pointed out that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of advance voting (26% of voters in Minsk) had opened the door to all manipulation.
"You noticed that there was an election," asked social democratic leader Alexandre Kozoulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, those who are best suited to power. "
The silence of the night returns to the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcome their success.
Interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was right to rejoice because Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
Most importantly, he regained the public's confidence that had been seriously shaken by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well known, national blood supplies managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In response to this tragedy and public grumbling, the Government of Canada launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Justice Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster to happen again.
While Justice Krever was late in filing his report, some provinces then set up a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Services to supply all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Héma-Québec began operations, just 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec," says Dr. Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
Through efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work in the field in the years that followed, we regained public confidence, "she said proudly that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the Quebec population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary keeps in mind that "trust is something extremely fragile."
From its inception on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, there was an outbreak in Europe of many cases of the human form of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which has been holding the fort since its foundation in 1998.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
One of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports was that when it is not known and a serious disease can result from it, namely Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by brain degeneration leading inevitably to death, exclusion measures should be introduced.
In April 1999, people who had spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980 were refused blood.
A few years ago, however, it was shown beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV testing appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests (NAT), which allow the presence of the virus itself to be detected directly in the blood of donors and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests previously used were based.
TAN has shortened the silent period, which extends between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
This significantly reduced the risk that some donors would be infected without knowledge and could not be detected.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people is at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
"In other words, it means distributing 12 million blood products before someone gets infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission from a blood product occurs.
I believe we can now feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, "said Héma-Québec's Chief Executive Officer.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Just last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on Reunion Island, which, like West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
We need to be constantly vigilant, "says Dr. Décary, noting that in addition to a secure supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
"Needs are increasing because the population is aging.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need recharge with red blood cells or platelets.
The aging population also has implications for the blood donor network, which represents on average only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation. "
A healthy person, 18 years of age and older who meets the eligibility criteria, can donate blood every 56 days, six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of people who offer their blood are not accepted, for example because they have AIDS or malaria, and if they have travelled to a malaria-ridden country, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Shortages are very rare.
But it is necessary to renew the members of this donor network as they age and can no longer give blood.
It is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and encourage them to become a regular donor.
As today's life is so unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour giving blood, "deplores Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, is full of blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth sample of cord blood, and we plan to collect more than a thousand a year.
We should start proposing transplants early next year, "says Dr. Decary, who describes this cord blood program as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot access it," because Héma-Québec cannot afford to offer this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Soccer - The Impact in the Semi-Final
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinal round of the USL's first division playoff series, with a 3-1 (4-3 in total goals) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders yesterday in the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series in total goals at the Saputo Stadium.
The midfield Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of play.
After a goal-free first half on both sides, midfield David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other nets of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one to beat Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
It should be remembered that during the first round-trip game on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 loss at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured at the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinal.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder filled a 3-1 deficit in the return game to win 4-3, but the Whitecaps still reached the 5-4 semifinal round in total goals.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In brief - Kovalev's victorious goal
The Canadian trio number one is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the attack in a 3-2 Canadian shootout against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec amassed two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the Habs fourth in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable. "
"He tried to overdo it in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he enjoyed the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation. "
Charest focuses on the North
Prime Minister does not rule out calling elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal General Council was finished, Jean Charest visited Jean-Talon in Quebec City yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), is trying to get elected in today's by-election.
"To push the boundaries of our last major northern border": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad outlines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Lévis yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was a sort of Moulin to images.
Surround, on three huge screens, spectacular shots of hydroelectric dams, mining, Quebec seen by "Google Maps," maps, etc.
Major means, as in the election period.
In the press briefing, moreover, the Prime Minister refused to exclude that he would trigger the elections this fall, although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy.
The "Plan Nord" is the fourth part of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space," which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe, and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was "a jewel with immense potential," but did not give any maturity, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At most, some avenues for further development include hydropower, forestry, but above all the mining sector, driven by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond," according to Charest's list.
This "territory twice as big as France," "it's at home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us, "he insisted, as if to show well that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec has built much in its relationship with the North, he said: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, said the Prime Minister at the press briefing.
"This is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time and, when the opportunity arises, I reiterate that position on behalf of the government, "he said.
Moreover, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open year-round due to the melting of ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the people of the territory, First Nations and Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former Pequist MP of Ungava), have already begun consultations with some 30 communities.
An interdepartmental committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important place, has begun work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "we will have a common vision."
The development of the North would be consistent with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be "concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in continuity with that of previous Liberal prime ministers.
"Like the Liberals before us, we thought differently to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a big cocktail to mark the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois Central in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who made the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of hydropower, to Bourassa, who made James Bay, our party was able to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
In a press briefing, he invoked another reference, conservative that one, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In approaching the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric dam project, Mr. Charest pointed out that its commissioning was planned for 2012.
"It stays between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his activists, provoking intense applause in them.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of triggering an election this fall, which the law allows him to do.
He pointed out, however, that his schedule was fulfilled, notably by a mission of the Federation Council to China and a Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend's General Council provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that have passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ calls in particular for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission and that they would have the right of veto over decisions taken in Quebec.
On the opposition side, the broad lines of the Plan Nord were welcomed with scepticism.
Pequist leader Pauline Marois outlined the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, when it came to power in 2003, abandoned its application.
If he had done so, "we would be more advanced today," commented Ms. Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (today's vote), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ expressed support for the government's adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," commented leader Sébastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who's back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonoured country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (O irony) in the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "shame" for Canada.
To cast the reproach on this woman who has fought relentlessly for justice and deserves our full admiration says as much about the Prime Minister's entourage as it does about Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are before a government that is the only one, of all the Western countries involved, who has not repatriated his national who has been locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the charges against him.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, renounces its word and leaves a child soldier in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, among others, are pleading for the repatriation of Omar Khadr to a fair trial in Canada.
It is this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it does not matter whether a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, probably forever after so many years of abuse.
We do not yet realize this, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy," a word that Harper is constantly waving and that sounds so hollow in his mouth.
This is the time when no morals exist anymore: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the goodwill of a previously minority head of government (what will happen after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has given up what made our country's reputation and dignity.
Shame, Mr. Toews, there she is, in this renunciation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Executive Vice-President of Canadian Barrick Gold Mining.
Following an Orwellian logic, he claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million-dollar libel lawsuit against three authors and a small, penniless publishing house to launch a "transparent public debate."
While it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of defamation proceedings, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
For, for Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the almost baseless pockets of mining.
Tactic, in these unequal struggles, is, moreover, often to ruin the defendants in order to impose an amicable settlement that will stab the opposition in addition to frightening anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was before public opinion that she should have presented her vision of the facts.
In contrast to many of the countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada normally take place through the exchange of ideas and not through a baton.
It was therefore sufficient for the mining industry to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust public opinion and rejects the petitions and letters of support to Black Canada authors.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can at the same time ask for a "public" debate while disregarding the opinions of the same public.
In the vice-president's world, it seems that this word only refers to lawyers with a high salary and not to all Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even critics have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - is that the public who supports Black Canada authors and publishers does so primarily because they reject the brutal way of mining.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchanges of arguments, and not in the context of what many perceive as a gag-chase (continuing the "public debate," Barrick Gold has just filed a demand against the authors of Black Canada urging them to cease the use of this term...).
Beyond Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's pursuit is a direct attack on academic freedom of research and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It denies, as a whole, the right to citation of credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If it is not possible to study and discuss subjects that are unpleasant to the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under the threat of repeated prosecution, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following the scientific standards used by Black Canada authors.
She has a right of reply.
The academic community, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate prosecution clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to put in place mechanisms to limit such abusive prosecutions.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans Agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to curb the financial crisis that has been shaking Wall Street for months has yet to be endorsed by both Houses of Congress.
It provides, inter alia, for better monitoring by elected officials of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for failure to pay, and a right of scrutiny over the salaries paid to the managers of the enterprises rescued.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in markets," said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to protect the real economy and ordinary Americans from the ongoing crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had been sprint in the last few hours for fear of the effect that a further failure would have on investors' mood.
The deadline was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential election, who were late in the negotiations, were rather in favour of the agreement, although they did not fail to express their displeasure at the fact that they were forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has taken it upon himself to add certain provisions to the agreement, including the provision to allow homeowners to keep their homes and the provision on the salaries of executives of businesses that have been rescued by the state.
"When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to be happy about.
But these measures are necessary, "he commented on American television.
Asked on another channel whether he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The outlines I have read [show] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing is simply not acceptable, "he said.
The $700-billion plan is designed to buy back with taxpayers' money the dubious, risky and unbearable debts of U.S. financial institutions.
After 14 months of a crisis triggered by the break-up of a housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of sub-prime mortgages, then extended to other, more widespread forms of credit securities (ACAP) and led to a freezing of liquidity and the debilitation of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican elected officials who had the first draft agreement over the last week.
It is believed that we have come out of this impasse since the democrats agreed that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty should only be insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to round the corners for everyone in Congress, a provision was also added that if the government were to bear losses for five years with this program, it could introduce new taxes to help it recover its stake.
The new plan provides for a first tranche of $250 billion, to which a further $100 billion may be added if the President deems it necessary.
Another $350 billion should be approved by another vote of Congress.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will obtain equity interests in the rescued companies that will earn him dividends in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the turmoil has passed.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures for housing attached to the real estate loans covered by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and severance payments to executives of affected businesses.
The architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote by the House of Representatives today, and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Voices continued to rise yesterday against this project, both in the Republican and Democratic camps.
"Washington obviously does not hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, to his constituents.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that takes advantage of taxpayers. "
As host of a small group in Congress called the "Caucus of Skeptics," Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presented things differently, but came to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us saying: Congress is being asked not to hurry and look carefully at the way forward," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US $16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas had announced that it had renounced to acquire its competitor in the midst of a shipwreck since it had lost 2 billion euros (US 2.9 billion) in the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
"This is not lost money," said Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
In exchange, we get a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and households now appreciate that times are coming uncertain. "
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Channel, the British government seemed on the verge of nationalizing another bank that had been malled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, including over US $41 billion (US $75.5 billion) in real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and accounts receivable of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an engaged icon
His beauty in the eyes of azure was for a long time his card asset, some will say his weakness.
Had he released himself from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with a charming smile?
Yes and no.
His modesty, his sensibility and a talent that flowed from the source will also have removed him from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But what a great cross-country runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday at age 83 from lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the good years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and whose he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his play, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of the freedom and break-up of dramatic conventions.
The mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother of origin.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, ultimate quality brand.
For in him came a whole country of self-made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art in Yale and then attended Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, on television, soon in cinema.
The same man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who finished second at the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, with a sex symbol, although he was a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
Also disappearing with him are the dark areas of this secret, discreet, committed star, allergic to the shrapnel of the show-business, whose riddle has not entirely been pierced.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The disappearance of Paul Newman has brought vertigo to the cinephiles this weekend, as his great roles clash on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation is unfolding through it.
Back in memory of Butch's charming cowboy Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejecting his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a hot roof adapted from Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), one evokes his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many more Paul Newman have gone to history.
The rookie Rocky Graziano, offender, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Someone Up There Likes Me, by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, taken over after his death, who really launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathetic prick in the brilliance of The Sting, Oscar for the best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in Robert Rossen's magnificent The Hustler (1961), he picked up the character on the return in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which in 1987 earned him his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That face through the ages, it was him.
Him again.
The epochs are bushering through his journey.
The young people know him mainly through the cult Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final Irish mob sponsor role in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the loop was closed.
In contrast to a number of movie legends that gave up the trade early on, Newman remained in the saddle for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its pâtes and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, not without humour, "as a living challenge to" underplaying "because he considered his performances to be too much supported.
The profession was not always tender to the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles fell for a long time.
However, he played the first young people less often than the marginals: neurotic, alcoholic, dirty or desperate, whose perfect features reflected the excesses and revolts.
As a director, Newman revealed unfamiliar facets of his true pudic sensibility.
Her Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), along with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, painted a finely feminine portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by overdose, gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, a work of modesty and sadness.
Among the homage rain that was taking place yesterday on Newman, his great friend and former gun mate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very saddened: "His presence made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vibrating features of the missing actor.
Beyond his career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a protester of Hollywood's drifters, also disappeared.
We've seen a lot of his binette huddling around on pots of vinaigrette, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process to be quite tasteful, though gag in the beginning.
The profits from these sales were, however, paid to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left a letter to his five daughters containing these sentences: "Always and until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be here. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the path of an American artist so lucid and generous.
Model citizen, in sum and in addition.
What could Zuschlag & amp; Compagnie do in their invoice factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the ongoing criminal proceedings will begin against János Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, on a permanent and regular basis, resulting in particularly serious damage. Other charges have been brought against them, such as forgery and the use of forgery.
According to the prosecutor's office, money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while benefits were justified by false invoices.
The money of the state and municipalities, about 65 million HUF in total, went on the one hand into the funds of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other, into the pockets of some people.
Their method, which was also made public by the investigating authorities, was to collect the money from the grants obtained by issuing bills of costs, behind which no actual services were provided and thus the associations never respected their commitments.
According to the indictment, a large part of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they purchased invoice books from the Józsefváros market, while they made the stamps in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies which were to appear on the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the latter's statement, he had to locate pensions and restaurants.
For his personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model of which they made the other invoices that they would introduce, among others, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of the Capital to access subsidies.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his accomplice András, who, according to our information, was mainly involved in drafting the files necessary to obtain the grants.
During a "tracking circuit," one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place provided for the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
Similarly, in the summer of 2002, the invoice drawn up in the name of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, which will later be named Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, was full of errors of form and substance.
A boarding house, located in Badacsonytomaj, actually had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred and thirty guests.
Invoice issuers with overwhelming imagination also fell into excess, when they mentioned the company Pigal Kft, also belonging to the Horeca sector. Neither Jobb Jövőért nor Hoppá's name appeared in their accounts, according to the information given to the prosecutor's office.
Győzā Farkas, the manager of the company, told the website hvg.hu that when the prosecutor summoned him and showed him the invoices, he knew immediately that they were false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a wrong place on the stamp."
He added: "Beyond form, the fact that according to the bill, one hundred people had lodged there, did not stick either, since this establishment has only eleven rooms, which do not have so much space.
In addition, the bill also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time. "
Nor did the zealous invoice issuers inquire about Budapest travel agencies, which are part of their choice, but only organise trips abroad. Thus, naively, they indicated stays in Hungary on bills to be paid in cash, which also runs counter to the agency's accounting practices.
Moreover, as it appeared during the investigation, they also added VAT on these documents, while services relating to travel activities, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate for the four invoices issued in the name of Hotel Revfülöp to the order of Jobb Jövőért was incorrect, since the company's services did not bear a VAT of 25% as indicated, but a VAT of 15%. Moreover, the hotel employees only issue printed invoices, while the false were written by hand.
The investigation by the Public Prosecutor's Office reveals that the "issuers" also made mistakes in referring to the carriage of goods by road as a service, which the company issuing the invoices could not exercise, since its profile was investment advice.
Moreover, it is also for defects of forms, such as inadequate types of invoices and false stamps, that the invoices issued to the order of Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont proved to be false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó sports course, both of which deny to be the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
Nor did the forgers pay attention to the fact that the company HIB Kft., based in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városert Egyesület was supposed to eat at home. According to our information, it is for this reason that the liquidator of the company denies having issued this invoice.
Invoices established deliberately
Another category of invoice issuers is those who were fully aware that they were being asked to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Bâtiestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták consortium, has drawn up an invoice payable to the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, Collab Kft. manager was forced to issue false invoices by one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi.
Similarly, cooperated with the Zuschlags, the company Biogate Kft., which is currently in liquidation and which in 2003 issued invoices to the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the association Atlasz Egyesület and the association Vörösfenyž Egyesület, for an amount of approximately five million HUF, but behind which no services were actually provided.
No financial transactions took place, either, as the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but organizations did not mention it in their accounts.
The next category of companies issuing invoices is companies directly related to the accused.
For example, the administrative delegate of the Managing Director of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with the fuel and motor vehicle trade, whose head office was in Budapest, but where he could not be found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, the equipment was purchased by Cash Investment Kft. de Kiskunhalas, which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a man of Romanian origin, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have sent documents related to the company, between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that he issued invoices to the order of the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that he secured their value.
It was precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Romanian masons created the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies functioned, which the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive work.
He still used these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding documents of the companies, he drew up invoices in their names, to the order of associations relating to Zuschlag, such as the Atlasz and Y-Generáció associations.
Kubatov gave a total of 15 invoices to organizations, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecutor & apos; s office thought that 10 per cent of the money on the bills and VAT went into Kubatov & apos; s pocket.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to make fictitious invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért applied for a grant to the public utility agency of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They obtained this grant for an amount of two times 500,000 HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives indicated in the application.
To prevent this from becoming known, five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft. were presented to the TMA.
In fact, these invoices were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office in the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused will report on the method of making invoices, as they had previously done before the prosecution.
What could be really interesting would be that the main defendant, János Zuschlag himself, decides to lift the veil on the whole story.
So far, his confession is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to tell the least detail, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in its interest, or if so, the Socialists would have reached an agreement according to which in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would bear the hat alone.
Today, he is probably offended, since applications for his house arrest, based on a reduction in his detention conditions, fall continuously into the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much greater damage, and the perpetrators of unrepairable economic crimes, walk freely or at least, wait at their own home for the end of the procedure. He does not have this possibility.
The Psychology of Overbidding: Why are we spending more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the commodity.
Researchers in neurology and economics at New York University have succeeded in updating the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as an eBay auction, and that's why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
This research has attempted to establish a neurological pattern of this kind of "game" using experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played the lottery, while the other group participated in a playful auction, while using a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) process, the researchers analyzed the active brain domains of the experimental subjects.
In both games, participants could earn money, but during the auction, an essential element of which is the third-party surcharge, the whole under the brain stem, called striatum, moved intensively when the game was lost.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self-stimulation" of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the rise in prices is explained by the flight from the violent reaction of striatum.
In support of their theories, the economic members of this group of researchers continued to carry out financial surveillance analyses.
At the time, three groups overpriced a partner under various circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and they thus made their bet.
To another group, they promised that if, on top of that, they were to win the game, then they would receive an extra $15 as a reward.
While the third group received that $15 before the auction, the members of the group also lost that money, in case they lost the auction.
The difference between these two groups is that the emphasis was on victory, while the emphasis was on failure.
By thus proving the neurologists hypothesis, the players' team members "against failure" were prepared for higher bets than those made by the control group and the "for victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomena observed during auctions only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by now leading to a third explanation. "- found Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should we consult a doctor?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned as one of the leading causes of death.
It is estimated that one hundred thousand patients carrying the hepatitis virus in Hungary, but only seven thousand are being treated, because patients often do not know that they are carrying the virus.
The name hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. Liver inflammation and jaundice are characteristic, but the pathogens and diseases generated differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, depending on the pathogenic genes, spread mainly in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tract (e.g. contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, vaccination against A and B viruses is recommended in any case. There is no C. Vaccine.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating contaminated foods, usually accompanied by general poor condition, weakness, stomach pain and nausea.
Then develops on the skin and on the white of the eye a visible jaundice, the stools become lighter and the urine takes a darker color. Healing may take two to three weeks.
Every year around the world, one million people die from the most serious form of this disease, such as cancer or cirrhosis of the liver caused by hepatitis B. The disease is a disease that can cause death.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten patients receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know about the virus, because the pathogenic gene destroys liver cells in a sneaky way. In many cases, the first symptoms do not appear until after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular screening tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average among a population of three groups: people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, there are 200 million chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide.
Since the disease can be detected by routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult your treating physician as soon as symptoms of unknown origin are observed.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, so the risk of contagion disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 by organizations representing patients from all over the world.
Its objective is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of the chronic liver caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does the one who grows in God feel less pain?
According to recent research, religious belief would function as a kind of analgesic, which would have already helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
The British daily Telegraph published an article according to which researchers at Oxford University realized an interesting experience in analyzing the level to which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this bizarre experience, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were subjected to electroshock, while each of them observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the suffering.
Thanks to a palpation technique of the human brain, it was also discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first in a series of experiments, in which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experiment is carried out as follows: an instrument emitting sparks and diffusing electroshocks is attached to the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Hermine Lady painted by Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers behind this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evokes a kind of state of faith among believers, while the choice of Da Vinci's painting, not very different from the first, was about its soothing effect.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while looking at either the religious theme painting or the more general theme painting.
The Catholics declared that in the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe," as someone "cared for," and they "calmed down, and peace invaded them."
When they saw the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% less pain than when they were watching Leonard's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experiment, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in atheists, provided he finds the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, Anglican bishop, welcomed the results of this research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases actually change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, it remains only the question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of the subjects if we show believers a Madonna painted by Leonard or by a painter of the same calibre?
Would the sight of a better Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you disclose about yourself.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google says that it can be found in the back of people's pockets just like the sky above their heads. It knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interests are.
Yet it is not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people in society.
While with regard to the skeptics making a parallel with Orwell's horror vision, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary for Google's founders to be able to meet their original goal, which sounded like: "Let's collect in a system all the information from the world!."
According to the Google leader interviewed, after ten years of global shambles, they are still only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will be in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is the job that would be best for me?." However, software will only be able to answer this kind of question, simple at first glance, on the day they will know enough about users.
It is not entirely clear to all Internet users that the words used during Internet searches, the IP address of the computer initiating the search and the pages consulted by interested persons are precisely listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and can consult what they have been looking for, on which they have clicked. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give much more personalized answers, and will submit products and services based on our previous declarations and recorded preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if they look at what my work is? ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by society that can provoke fear, and it is not remorse, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or possibly revolt against power that can provoke a counter-reaction among netizens.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such legal cases nothing protects the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example in recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian paedophiles, during which Google passed on to the Brazilian government the information it had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus allowing identification.
Human rights netizens were able to sigh a sigh of relief last May, when Google, arm-in-hand with EFF's electronic legal protection agency, proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the ruling rendered in the future, Google will still not be obliged by any of the constitutional points to disclose information about the FBI's secret request of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms that it had won in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, passed several years earlier. But ultimately, it failed to obtain the lists of private users' searches, nor the entire list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore quite contradictory: it is resisted by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of revolt that is manifested against multinational corporations proud of their conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its "wildlings" bringing together enthusiasts, activists and enthusiastic computer users who appear in many countries see Google as the next generation of big companies, the "branched corporation," as opposed to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, even though both are fighting for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for identification code, does not ask for money for its applications. The documentary code and the continuously refreshed package of programs has a much more accessible, younger and cooler effect, faced with the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geeks see very exactly the problematic relationship between human rights and the Internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed keyword of recent years, draws precisely behind it.
Indeed, web 2.0 does not concern anything other than collaboration, but the fact that we intentionally leave traces behind, and that we use the channels of communication at our disposal, and while the dimension of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can hold a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even link them to other services, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then, he can link them to a tracking system, such as Friendly Feed or Blip.fm. These young people can also hold blogs, in which they automatically appear their most recent photo galleries that they store on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can see many examples, such as that of the girlfriend who easily understands in view of the morning photos, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom her unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company that dismissed one of his employees, just for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, we can be sure of one thing: the term of privacy is totally to be reconsidered today.
The one who lives an online life, is made up of what he shows of himself, and that is how we can define the principle behind the behaviour of today's young people.
The one wants to hide something, or at least, wants to try to circumvent Google's monopoly, can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using Google's search system, but at the same time, intentionally leaving no trace).
The number of people who deliberately do not register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is not the least. Google's services online, through word processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not attached to huge server parks and which do not assemble our best profile, having existed to date.
Public opinion is waiting, without really hiding, for the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion). AdWords / AdSense advertising domains threaten the revenue of advertising agencies, while services introduced at an increasing speed cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but to many other computer program creators.
However, critical observers find, in addition to all this, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, employee protests, after it has doubled the price of business kindergarten and after the company has found it too expensive to restore multiple daily, taken at any time. All this seems ridiculous apart from the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquiesced before the Chinese government and according to the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of the company, the new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is certain is that in the coming months and years they will move the world on new points. While some people think that Google's scan and archiving of books and magazines takes on such important dimensions that the company will soon find itself facing the Supreme Court of the United States, others are trembling in front of its health system, because in this one we can build a complete medical profit from our results from previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can give a good raw material to the next generation of science fiction writers. The novel by the famous Cory Doctorow, written with Orwellian semitones, describes the future in which a man could be approached in a frightening way just through Google's data.
Two miners helped remove the traces of Ózd's double homicide.
"The police summoned two minors to question them in the case of the double homicide of Ózd. According to well-founded suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of the crime." - said the spokesman of Borsod department police station.
The young people have acknowledged the charges against them and are currently accused of complicity.
The two minors, who according to information from MTI (Hungarian Telegraph Agency) are young girls, defend themselves free.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ózd, a 23-year-old local young man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicide, committed premeditated and out of interest.
During the investigation, it turned out that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt, and that is why he attracted his creditor, last Wednesday, to a site in Ózd where he killed him, as well as this 9-year-old man's little daughter.
According to information from MTI, the young man premeditated his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the scene of the crime is proof of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has proposed two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech kroner, for the purchase of 100% of the share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish have made despite the fact that, previously, the Czech Republic has excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to separate from more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activities.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest offer that has been made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse have made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the new least good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could lead to the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by market experts to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech kroner.
On the basis of an agreement between the shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance, with about 25 percent stake, followed by the 14.7 percent of the bank Ceská Sporitelna and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, which are getting worse every day, the leading newspapers of the European press already mention a "second 11 September."
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the American President" - accuses the Rome daily, La Repubblica. "The President was not even able to block with his own party behind a proposal for a law, improvised at once, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as billionaire Warren Buffett mentioned, it is more appropriate to talk about a second September 11.
Part of the Madrid press also sees the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily El Mundo, it was the failures of the political leadership there that brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is increasing every day, and then the world will pay a heavy price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, according to the Congress vote, a real threat, one that Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in a vacuum, just as in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - points out the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states can still offer a lifeline to their staggering financial institutions, and thanks to their taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if even more banks fall like dominoes, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, we need the states of the European Union to take little account of their national egoism, and to centralise control over divided financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Viennese daily Der Standard, who added that fears that European taxpayers too will have to put their hands in the pocket, very deep, in a way similar to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, are becoming increasingly realistic.
So far, the EU has not really dealt with the crisis, which, like a tsunami, crosses the old continent from one side to the other.
The "rescuers" should not immediately raise a hundred billion euros, but it would be wise if they noted in what case it would be rational to touch taxpayers' money, with the aim of preventing greater damage.
Intelligent Automobile Mimics Theft Theft
What method would be better for developing technologies to avoid an obstacle, other than the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
Like, for example, bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the buzzing bees gave Nissan engineers the strategic idea of starting, to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacle detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a self-driven, bio-inspired system, of the type BR23C, which he equipped with bee qualities, the ultimate aim being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
During its flights, each bee constitutes its own space, oval-shaped, which in reality looks much like our secure protective hull - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the brand's research and development and technological public relations department.
The facet eye of the bee plays a crucial role, since it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To mimic the functions of the facet eye, the engineers approached the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies obstacles at an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it evaluates distances and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which turns it into an avoidance manoeuvre immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini auto robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle sufficient to avoid collision.
Unlike any existing system, this avoidance manoeuvre is entirely instinctively carried out.
"If this were not the case, the mini robot car could not react fast enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotic car project.
It must react instinctively and instantaneously, since this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of the protective envelope, a layer where for the moment the collision is considered inevitable.
This whole process must reflect what the bee does to avoid other bees.
The process must take place in a blink of an eye.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be of two dimensions, and only in the direction in which the wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combinations that bees possess to avoid other bees, in our case, we could only use rotary motion, acceleration and slowing as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini robot auto
The BR23C uses polymer Lithium batteries that are lighter and have a larger energy concentrate, making their lifetime longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the intelligent instinctive reaction that is paramount, not the processing of data, let alone the ability to store.
This mechanism should only process a few incoming signals per second, and react to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on data from previous manoeuvres. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of continuous memory.
You don't need memory of a gigabyte capacity, or even megabytes.
This is the first step towards the design of instant avoidance technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter mass-produced cars in the next ten years.
Another application could be its incorporation into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to his destination by avoiding obstacles on his way.
We even gave the baby an expensive name.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue plan, designed to buy back the banks' questionable loans, and to use them several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this money is going to be spent.
Reuters announces that during new debates extending until after midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the controversy that has existed for days and days around the $700 billion rescue plan.
"We have taken a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who said that the only thing left to do is to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The US Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, commented on the outcome of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. Pelosi says that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's wheels in the other direction.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday evening at 8 p.m., Washington local time (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., Central European local time), but did not cause a dramatic rise in the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill responding to the name of the emergency economic stabilization law of the year 2008. Then, its fate will be in the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, White House spokesperson.
In addition, the program diverges from the Bush administration's initial proposal that the $700 billion should be spent on one-time buybacks of doubtful credit.
From now on, up to half of the $700 billion can be spent. The first $250 billion will be issued immediately after the passage of the law by Congress, probably on Monday. This first amount will be used by the Treasury Secretary to purchase bad debts from banks, while the use of the additional $100 billion will be left to the President's discretion.
The programme will be overseen by an independent body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the Act, the Treasury Secretariat will be able to implement a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to purchase dubious debts, securities relating to dubious mortgages and other types of "toxic" debts.
Competent departmental officials have stated that buybacks can take place in the context of an auction, but also directly.
The rule allows the companies concerned to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools that give rise to the concerns, for which the companies will have paid a premium equivalent to the foreseeable damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the legislation provides the necessary tools to devote $700 billion to the urgent needs of the financial system, whether it is the large buy-back of doubtful debts, their insurance, or to avoid the risk that the system will lead to the collapse of one or the other major financial institution.
"We will make the necessary arrangements, to be ready for the application of the law, as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank managers in poor positions awaiting state aid can expect their severance payments, simply referred to as a golden parachute across the Atlantic, to be capped by the government.
Salary caps are mentioned only in specific cases, and limitations depend on how the Treasury Secretariat offers assistance to the company.
The cap principle means that if the Treasury Secretariat buys in an auction, they will levy an excess tax on the golden parachute, unless the discredited bank president retires.
Directly after the repurchase of doubtful accounts, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to executives is not overstated.
For the image to be complete, it must be added that the existing golden parachutes are not modified. The cap only concerns new contracts, this to motivate participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in place on the appointments of directors general - commented the chairman of the committee responsible for financial services of the Chamber of Deputies, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the state acquires a right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the plan. In this way, the risk of taxpayers decreases, since they can even win in the business as soon as the economy and with it the saved banks fall on their feet.
The bill mentions that in the next five years, the President must submit to Congress a proposal that will rule on how the losses will be returned to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That's not why American citizens mandated us, it doesn't protect taxpayers' dollars - said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believes that it is the same people who are pressing for action, as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in deflation in oil processing (1.4 per cent), electrical machinery and apparatus (0.9 per cent), and a minimal increase in wood processing (0.1 per cent).
Prices for paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
Other sectors of the processing industry experienced an increase of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent a significant share of domestic industrial production, prices rose by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in gas prices introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, oil processing prices showed the most significant increase (32.4 per cent).
In the metallurgical manufacturing sector, prices rose by 13.2 per cent, while in the important area of food, beverage and tobacco production, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Price declines occurred in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In the other sectors of the processing industry, price increases ranged from 0.6 per cent to 9.1 per cent.
In the processing industry as a whole, prices have increased by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors were 18.7 per cent higher than in the previous year.
Among the domestic trade groups and by sector allocation, in August, the most significant monthly price increase (0.7 per cent) was in the profit-on-investment sectors.
In the consumer goods production sectors, prices increased by 0.3 per cent, while those of the energy and material producing sectors for further processing did not change from the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of the previous year, the largest increase was observed in the energy and processing sectors (16.8 per cent).
In the consumer goods production sectors, inflation was measured at 6.8 per cent, while for the profit-generating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent.
Industrial export sales prices in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they fell by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national means of payment weakened by 1.7 per cent against the euro, and by 7.1 per cent against the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it strengthened by 7.5 per cent against the euro and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there is a good chance that the US-Hungary visa-free agreement will enter into force by 12 January. That is what the Foreign Minister said in Chicago, before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to her, "now everything depends only on when the overseas electronic input and control systems will be put into operation."
However, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system there would be no entry visa, but tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will present the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the banks' rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major American parties, pledged their support for the government's $700 billion rescue plan. However, there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Treasury Secretary.
After Marathon negotiations that lasted for days and days, Congress representatives and the Administration finally announced, Sunday at dawn, that they had reached agreements in principle on the bank rescue plan.
This financing plan, aimed at thawing the Wall Street crisis and the paralysed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as better than the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, with the focus on economic issues, Obama again managed to get a little ahead. McCain's lead, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colisterist just after the Republican convention, melted.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly pass the law on the $700 billion rescue plan.
He pointed out that the proposal contained the consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now that we must act with responsibility... a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the entire economy," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not fail to describe McCain's economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "We will all have trouble swallowing it (...) but doing nothing is not a possible path."
The Republican Senator stated that in the proposal, mention was made of the creation of a Treasury Control Commission and the cap on the severance benefits of senior leaders, and that he was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had no substantive role in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Secretary of the Treasury.
Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there are serious hopes that the House will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The camp on the right is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that voters have become more aware - this is how the Der Spiegel, the low CSU score in the Bavarian country, evokes.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the Red and Black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the internet edition of the German left-wing news magazine, Franz Walter analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers."
According to this renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades, and now it is the same modern citizens who turn their backs on them.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not quite a surprise, but Sunday came to an end a process that was likely just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to the modernization "devouring his parents," which was consistently implemented in the region by the CSU.
The sociologists have been announcing this for 40 years, but they have been very wrong about the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the establishment of northern and eastern Germans in the developing Bavaria region could not remain unaffected by the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The camp on the right is intact, it is only within the party that voters have become more conscious, more critical and more stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks it has been precisely the groups of classical citizens who have moved rather far away from the CSU, such as the self-employed, craftsmen, holders of the baccalaureate and graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support fell below 40 per cent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
In his article entitled "Who? With whom? Party leaders stand on the reserve in the face of coalition issues," the Austrian Conservative daily deals with the state of confused domestic politics that took place after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wish to discuss with the Conservatives of the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. The Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The elections took place, now everything revolves around the coalition; during debates on public television, party leaders barely gave a glimpse of their cards.
Werner Faymann, President of SPÖ, confirmed that he wished to discuss with ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - this is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP president, as vice-chancellor, remains open on Faymann's part.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molterer approach was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of the question.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the Red proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will surely be unsuccessful if Faymann tries to interfere in ÖVP's internal affairs.
In his party, the choice of the opposition or of joining the coalition is for the moment a very open question, and these points must be debated in the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider, President of BZÖ, is once again open to any proposals.
"To avoid the Red and Black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities" - said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, hosted by France, began as a representative of the current presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, MEP Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is a violation of the law that affects most Roma children and thus one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened on the one hand by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of European legal protection and civil bodies, in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz Popular Party group, Járóka warned that, in addition to the distinctions observed during the recruitment process, Roma people disappear from the labour market, primarily as a result of their low qualifications.
"An overwhelming majority of Roma young people do not have secondary school diplomas, and as a result of poor basic education, only a small party has the possibility of obtaining a higher education diploma."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a basic human right plays a key role in the promotion of other fundamental rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children means strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest possible circle, also between Roma and non-Roma.
The earlier a Roma child starts school, the more likely he or she increases his or her chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on his or her income and consumption, he or she participates in the State budget.
"Because of their European Union nationality, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education and protected from low quality and sectarian education." - stressed Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member of the European Union, an objective-oriented and action-oriented collaboration is needed for an immediate acceleration of the process of desegregation of schools. To this end, compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation is of paramount importance.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. We must give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens of their own right in the future of Europe" - demanded Járóka.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Equal Opportunities Summit in Europe, which has been held every year since the summit in Berlin last year, is to provide a single platform to support measures to promote equal opportunities and combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a period of transition
The decision on the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the Bavarian CSU summits has been postponed.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still remain in their place. The question is how long will the grace last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a catastrophic 17 per cent loss of voice, will be on the agenda of the Congress of the Exceptional Party, held on the last weekend of October.
The members of this highly criticized pair, in any case, made it feel that they did not care about their seat.
Thanks to this, they worked to appease the furious members of the faction and base, which one day after the "Bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, one year after the coup against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was Bavaria's "sole sovereign" giving 18 per cent of German GDP.
But the Conservatives still count heavily in this southern region, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced into the coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reorganisation of the party, the vice-president and federal minister of agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's possible successor, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates tempting discussions with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Free Electors, formed along the right-wing values, about a possible coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Free Electors, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as a possibility of putsch perpetrated by the duo Huber-Beckstein, then unwaveringly treat the very ambitious woman municipal politics.
Now, CSU leaders are putting all their energy to stabilize, one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who until now was pulling the strings behind the scenes, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, designated September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some bold remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have earned much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will only be able to become Chancellor again if they return to office in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, scarcely concealing his disappointment caused by fiasco, the CSU's loss of land will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
However, this is relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis continues.
Since 1946, the SPD has achieved its worst results with 18.6 percent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - his rivals: 110 - 0
No opposition MP joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is due to a country headed by Alexander Lukashenko, which ensures prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it is due to illegality in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the 110-person legislature in this country of 10 million inhabitants has been running very well in opposition for decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his term as president for the fourth time in dubious elections, in the footsteps of the constitutional amendment in 2006, "would allow" this time the presence of some opposition deputies in parliament.
In this way, the ODSZ renounced its originally planned boycott.
The fact that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, would like to improve its relations with the EU, where because of the Belarusian political order described as anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians did not receive an entry visa, was one of the opposition's expectations. Belarus had to take credit because of the decrease in imports of Russian natural gas, which was ever more expensive, and thus contributed to the passage of the Beltransgaz company, the owner of gas pipes crossing the country, has passed to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, when evaluating the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on shortcomings, such as the prohibition of one third of opposition candidates, referred to a prior appeasement.
However, the OSCE communiqué of Monday already challenged the campaign, during which most of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: the political detainees have regained freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, still refusing to recognize South Ossetia and Abazzia separated from Georgia. However, Russia with which Belarus forms a confederation on paper, has considered the two independent territories for a month already.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue has been initiated between Belarus and the EU" - Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this should remain so, despite the fact that "the power was afraid in this Parliament, which has no weight, to bring in even one opponent."
The opposition does not plan any protest actions in the light of the results, but rather tries to send its message about the need for economic reforms to the voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to get our opposition newspapers printed in Russia, the local authorities are putting us on the sidelines in terms of broadcasting, but I can also see that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly" - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current Lukashenko regime, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensioners no longer really considers it appropriate.
"Because of the country's indebtedness and the rising trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'evoking the silence of a cemetery', is only a matter of time" - says Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers called the elections democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in deeds." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, did not have rotating doors for the entrance and exit of the employees.
But as of today, this new measure against the smart ones is in force, against which points and then goes to drink coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-lazy novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The touring doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument for working better, with more productivity, more attendance and more services," said the Minister.
Now begins a new season of accountability and transparency.
"It's reformism," Brunetta also points out.
The establishment of the Presidency of the Council in all its establishments is complemented by the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the choice of rotating doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of the employees has been recorded, says the secretary general: "This is a process shared by the employees, and we had the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee or croissant.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 am is an excellent and healthy resolution."
At a conference at the Ecole Supérieure de l'Administration publique
"In three months, the sickness absences of public employees have been reduced by 50%, or 60 thousand more workers in one year."
And he adds that it is essential to make the Public Administration more effective.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - explains the minister - over the last 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the standards of the Brunetta decree using the Codacons.
"" while the Minister of Public Service is spreading today the data regarding the decrease of absenteeism in the workplace because of sickness - writes the consumer association - the people of "active lazy" continue to increase.
Indeed, in Italy, thousands of correct and productive employees of the Public Administration, gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allowances in the event of infirmity on the grounds of service is disputed; the extension of the working hours of the sick worker's permanent residence, during which the inspection visits are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: "Critical prevention"
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons who remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, the Inail data confirm that the white deaths were about 1,200.
Figures that show the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
For the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic aspect, Anmilian is celebrating today, in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Victims of Accidents at Work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmilian, as well as the tragic events of recent days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention in the workplace," says the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Anmilian, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "sincere appreciation for the continuous associative effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion"
"Naturally indignant, everyone has struck with their fists to put an end to such tragedies which, by their size, elicit the clamour of the media and the participation of public opinion, even if the daily reality presents us with dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a problem of resources: it is essential to invest in training and information"
The many initiatives promoted in the school sector are particularly important for a more direct awareness on the part of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to maintain attention to this phenomenon, not to underestimate the alarm about social gravity, to implement and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini stressed how "this phenomenon of the white dead constitutes an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and requires all institutions to make a concrete effort to put an end to it quickly."
The data of the injured on the work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths is still impressive, "stressed later the president of the Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"we do not want this" downward trend "to actually translate into a minor attention, because it is precisely when the attention is relaxed that the tragedy happens.
"we believe that in general, we do not do enough to contrast the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be made through multiple actions."
"According to us - has emphasized Mercandelli- more controls and inspections are necessary, as well as a greater intervention on the training of workers, and this, from the school."
- He added: "We need to make further efforts with regard to communication and public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon which represents a social emergency."
"Mercandelli then denounced" the progressive deterioration of the conditions for safeguarding the compensation provided for victims of work "and the" drift of assistance towards which the system is moving in recent years. "
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the guarantee of insurance - he added - so that the fate of the person who has an accident, should not depend on spontaneity or the enlargement of the legislature."
Mp3 reader pointed to the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening to full-volume music for an extended period using portable musical devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission announces, which in a press release in Brussels cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on the unexpected and recently identified health risks (Csrseri) of the EU, published today.
"of this scientific report - read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than one hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of auditory capacity."
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical devices and full-volume mobile phones can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
"According to the scientific data - continues the person in charge U- this is a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also re-examine the existing control systems in the light of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies. "
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they generate.
"Scientists-concluded the U- confirm that there are good reasons for concern, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties, what measures could possibly be adopted to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard which limits the noise level of portable musical devices to 100Db, but there is increasing concern about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
These data using solutions such as reducing noise levels and duration of exposure can be well limited.
The Scientific Committee notes that users of portable musical devices, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours per week, exceed the current limits on the maximum noise level at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for extended periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified at around 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno ordered the Commission to leave for the future of the capital.
Today we start, in March we finish, in June we will draw the sums.
This is the timetable set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital," which took place this morning at the new headquarters behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
In six months' time, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will finalize the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they are finished, the Committee and the Municipal Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so that in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome will be presented with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it - stresses Alemanno - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome to be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Communal Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a place where to draw up a great project for Rome.
In March, she will have completed her tasks and will then disappear, as this experiment must have a precise time span.
In June - announced on May- we will present the strategic plan resulting from the work carried out by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital. "
For those who accuse the Commission of being unnecessary, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, as well as the quality of its proposals.
If quality is there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as indeed in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is overwhelmed by the day-to-day and emergency management that occurs from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to see forward, and further, towards a deeper foresight, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future. "
Moreover, the Mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not an unnecessary body or a bureaucratic body: it is absolutely free, and will not cost the Roman citadines a euro, and will serve to study and involve the best intelligences that express the capital.
For Alemanno, in fact, "we need a draft strategic reference, neither firm nor immobile, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking of its future now a unitary spirit,."
A future which, according to the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the usual communal borders, but which will look further" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but "also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
A famous American politician who wanted to be considered independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had relations (as he still has today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam. "
Attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date draws closer.
A Miami lady wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really bold: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has two governors and five black senators in all! "
In reality, these are attacks that don't say much; they are of course attacks of a racial nature, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? We also have polls, which all say Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case, it is still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern entrails of the United States wrote an article: once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will give his vote to.
There comes an aspect of the American mentality that is kept secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves put the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things that have never been revealed to date, to such an extent that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these arguments, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked: what were Bush's mistakes during his tenure? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was kicked back home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to pack.
Despite this, most of Iraq has been Bush's weak spot.
Who will take the place of George W will have a huge task to accomplish.
Usa, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is time for suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "murder" of newspaper paper.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists are now pessimistic about their future.
However, they did not openly say to the information attachés, feeling less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the deletions made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work on assembling newspapers, are a big problem.
This is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as the general public understands it is to be reduced in a consistent way.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten executive seniors and newspaper journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is on the wrong path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Publication imprimé contre broadcast.
Journalists have no trouble seeing where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses are passing through the Internet, perceived by many as the "killer" of newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to using technology hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest catch in American journalism is between who runs the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at local level this percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this is related to "safety at work."
Managers who think they are losing their jobs within 3 years are 47% at national level.
As far as journalists are concerned, we're going to 30%.
The issue of "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In an immense nation like the Usa, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and it quickly becomes a question of taking or leaving.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
As for holidays, the logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third year, up to 15 days in all, spent a certain number of years.
But, according to their revelations, American journalists are often "sick" during the year.
It's the climate's fault.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPPOLA REST TO GR& apos; FERRATA.
The president of the second criminal division of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to be able to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy under the Unipol-Bnl Climbing Instruction.
During the trial against him last week, he had been released from his home as a compulsory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had requested that the real estate agent be allowed to travel from the provincial town to a residence in the capital.
According to the court, such travel (which the PC did not grant) would allow him to influence his society and to have access to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and still is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times of yesterday that confirms to us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more divided between its moderate East Coast soul, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, powerful especially in the central and southern states.
The soul, precisely, that made itself felt despotically with the vote I was talking about at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is just one example of the changes, of the great changes that the current economic earthquake preannounces or already leaves running: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so much so that, in the new climate, they solidify and reveal themselves.
The first of these phenomena is the revival, the extraordinary revival, of the two sovereign-state category, in relation to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which, of course, have close relations with foreigners, but which, above all, are involved on a large scale, the balance sheets of individuals and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for whom it is governed: that is, to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically, it is almost only here at home.
Political internationalisation really seems out of the question or has little to say: the obvious proof is provided by the European Union, which, as usual, shares between the various interests and between the various national strategies, fails to decide any common political line.
And so, it is the government of each state that all expect interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and above all a allocation of funds: when you go through a difficult period, there is only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of trying to put things back in place.
They also have the means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of invaluable value, elements that no market or international organization can ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the state-nation crisis is, moreover, in perfect harmony with the ever-greater importance that the more recent economic developments of the economy tend to attribute to a factor quite related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized at one stroke, that our future will have to settle more and more its accounts with rather little material things like water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another from the earth, but that are absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
Thus, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the misfortune to live in a place without harvest, oil and water.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Which says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this respect, the economic crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to take charge of the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved inadequate and full of shade.
Moreover, something even deeper, in a certain sense, even worrying: a discredit, suffering, an image of inadequacy, a feeling of remoteness that tends to involve the entire class of directors in an increasing number of Western countries.
Thus increases even more the conviction of the various classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites until now at their peak, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, to have the same time, and to be ever more alien to the opinions of majorities.
In short, the demand for leadership, underlies a powerful and branched movement of delegitimizations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which manifest themselves in the improvised electoral "revolts" or, in the collective mood changes of recent times, from the conservative ascent in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of Labour in Great Britain, to the rebellion of American Congressmen against Bush (and it may well be that the victory of the right in Italy did not happen by chance).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format, someone would say, have ever more difficulty, which is not old today, in understanding and thus in representing the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially agitates in a disproportionate way.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "rebellion of the masses" on the agenda seems frankly exaggerated.
But it is said well, keeping your eyes wide open, it is not without reason.
The superglue to walk on the walls.
Win the laws of gravity with a super glue and, in the future, walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With an adhesive measuring just 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers managed to keep a body of 100 kilograms glued to a vertical wall.
ETUDE- The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is an evolution of those we know who use a particular carbon structure, called nano carbon tubes.
"The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a stack of spaghetti." Zhong Lin Wang of Atlanta's Georgia Institute of Technology explains.
Scientists have taken inspiration from the legs of the geckos, covered with microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, a perfect adherent.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "easily detaches itself from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at Dayton University.
PROCUREMENT ON MURS? - "This material could be used as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since nano carbon tubes are conductive of heat and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
Right now, no superheroes.
OTHER RESEARCH - The University of Berkeley, California, is also looking for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American American Chemical Society, California researchers presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair, which self-cleans dust during movement over an area to ensure perfect and constant adhesion.
Medicines: never with fruit juices.
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are desalterant and rich in vitamins, if combined with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices, whether canned or fresh, if they are associated with the ingestion of certain drugs; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launches a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apples is enough to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, nullifying their beneficial effects and putting patients at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been strongly criticized for being responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, anti-staminal and neurological drugs to toxic levels.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - It was the Italian Medicines Agency itself, which had given the news in a two-year information bulletin, warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger of this mix and to pay attention to drinking, if you take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT THAT PAMPLEMOUS- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From there, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology of the Public University of Milan: "These discoveries are generally, immediately reported to the various national and international drug agencies which will have to change the information notes of the medicines if necessary.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines you are taking, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to speak clearly to the doctor or pharmacist, "stressed the expert at the Ansa agency.
The Nobel of Economics to Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neo-Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman wrote in an article published on the New York Times that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences for the history of the United States.
A prediction that unleashed many polemics, and was blamed on the economist for years, but now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a bit shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is not only a "high-value economist," but also a "very aggressive," and particularly critical of the Bush administration's excesses of liberalism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open-source suite of personal productivity that aims to reach ever more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following almost a year of work, carried out by volunteer developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package shows itself to the general public with various novelties: from the welcome screen, and the interface reviewed and become less austere, to other more important ones, such as compatibility born for the operating system Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007 suite, and it is indeed possible to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting are certain features specific to certain modules, such as the one that reduces the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for sending them by e-mail, or for importing PDF files into the graphic development module, keeping the original aspect of the page.
Still on this front, it is possible to create "hybrid PDF" documents that link the typical Adobe format graph to the elements of a spreadsheet or text developer.
Multi-person collaboration has had various improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet, various users can intervene, avoiding conflicts about changes, in the drafting of texts, because each collaborator is assigned a colour of comments for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks, they should issue the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download 300.htmlet and is in addition to the English version that has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is as usual available in addition, for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation cd can be sent to home or the workplace.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a means of disseminating it in houses, it is precisely in business, that Open Office the suite tries the great challenge, which can already count on various projects carried out in the public administration and schools.
Not to mention the realities that offer a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing equivalent to Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for rival PowerPoint presentations; Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that works on databases; and Drwa is the graphical module.
Target for 2008, arrive at 5 million download, and considering that today there are almost 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, one can even exceed the expected figure
Kohl, too, is positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian of the Gerolsteiner team, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
It is the website of the daily L'Équipe that reports the news.
At the age of 26, Kohl was the fourth positive cyclist at the Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Blood tests carried out on the Kohl test pieces are part of those carried out in recent weeks by the laboratories of Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity in the Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positivity at the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, having notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian took the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, taking home the best climber's polka dot jersey.
NEW YORK TIMES REQUESTS IF ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of emigration has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" greeted with reluctance.
Would that turn the Beautiful Country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times is interested in, which has dedicated a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan, for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "northern paradox": the northern regions are both those where "more integration and more work" is recorded, but also "a strong anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the most important support for the Northern Lega."
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also referred to the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislature called for by the Lega to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as evidence of the changing climate in Italy.
According to the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, during his meeting with Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked that the State and the Church work together to overcome racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rents, up to 900 euros for a room.
The student rental market knows no crisis
According to the latest survey of the Sunia, the syndicate of tenants, renting a single room can cost a student, up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects to the point of excluding entire categories of young people, from the right to study because of the very high overall costs that families of origin must support - explains Sunia's head of the study office, Laura Marian- in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of widespread increase has begun even for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also involve a series of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, with no rent limit, sub-leases.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions through the tax review are needed to calm prices.
Looking at the survey in detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room, it ranges from a minimum of 650 euros (zone Bande Nere), to an average of 800 euros (zone Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (zone Vittoria)
In Florence, a bed costs on average 350 / 400 euros, a room about 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in areas close to the University, it takes 250 / 280 euros for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Slightly lower values (550 euro for a single) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can save only if you move away in the peripheral areas: 300 euro for a bed, and 450 for a single in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed it takes 300 / 400 euros, for a single, you spend 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, for bed, you have to count 250 / 350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they are of major importance in the urban economy.
Finally, cities such as Perugia, where rentals are often taken by extra-Community students, have a further anomaly: the rent charged to foreign students is 25 / 30% higher than that charged to Italians.
Farewell old cinema Paradiso, the cities elect the historic halls.
The historic cinemas are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore, illustrates well what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provincial cities,
The process of marginalisation of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of consumption of single rooms in the central areas of cities, is one of the major events that seems inevitable and indisputable to us; moreover, it has all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often historical places full of memory, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a bit of a journey and so many emotions," observes the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that offers Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar as well as the Grand Prix de la jurée de Cannes, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall, and the nostalgia of a way of living cinema, lost may be forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of merchants, mean everything: in the last five years, 316 cinemas of the traditional type have closed, and it is the cinemas of the main cities that have mainly paid for them: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, Emilia Romaine is in the lead with 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The proof which confirms that the first one responsible for their disappearance is the advent of multiplex, because it is indeed the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multiroom cinemas: 195 screens in addition in Lombardy over the last five years, 81 in Tuscany as in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian farm has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, President of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to guarantee the survival of those that already exist, because when a room closes in a city, not all of them are necessarily willing to go to multiplex.
Not to mention the missed deliberation of credit in favour of merchants: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful that, from an ethical and moral point of view, the Government is not complying with existing laws.
To support the sector, it would take between €16 million and €18 million per year.
We note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, concerned about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to defend and promote the mono-theatre cinemas of the historical centres and on the outskirts.
Among the normative measures planned are measures of tax facilities for managers and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic zone, and will have special rates for parking and in certain parking lots.
"This is an initiative that I like," notes Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna implementing other measures.
It is clear, however, that in order to counteract the superpower of multiplex, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's audience is more demanding.
The defence of traditional cinema is a theme that for me has always been important: the closure of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Paradiso cinema" that I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, I turn on the other side not to see the panels blackened by dust.
Links between politics and "ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to standardize the choices of the Town Hall to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
The judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, against the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outside competition for mafia association.
The levers also for Gioacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his grandson lawyer, the boss's namesake, who has already been sentenced for criminal association of a mafia type, as well as to pay 10 million euros.
"an affront to legal and moral norms, and above all to common sense," wrote the prosecutors, both local administrations had expressed the will to pay for consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Thus it would have been granted to the clan - write the judges - to enter officially within the town halls facilitating the already considerable possibilities of control and direction of the public administration"
The chairman of the Calabrian regional committee Agazio Loiero, does not hide only "collusions between local committees and organized crime, there are more than one" in his region: "there are places where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the ndrangheta, heroes who are honest "
This morning's arrests follow those of July, following which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli clan.
By the end of April, Gioia Tauro's municipal council had been dissolved; already in 1991, and still because of alleged conditionalities between organized crime and local government, local politicians had been relieved of their role of administering the city.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed leader of a centre right coalition, after the balottage in May 2006.
He cried out for scandal when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the communal council.
He accused the vice minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, accusing him of manipulating it all for a political issue, but in view of the request for imprisonment signed this morning, the judges explain that the Piromalli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
Starting from the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, the pm write, is emerged "the readiness to marry the demands of a businessman, representing a more known group, close to the Piromalli, uniting the choices of the public administration with the interests of the clan.
When energy is born from the waves, now the big ones start.
This is a huge deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface area and now the world's leading energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which colosses like Chevron have laid their eyes, and now try to get their hands.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has now been studied for 100 years, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now the environmental authorities and the new increase in oil are giving a big boost to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by sea swell systems.
This quantity would be twice that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Colosses to attack.
The first company to invest in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed like a real revolutionary step.
Two years later, more and more of these companies have always been dedicated to traditional energy and rely on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies - said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colossus, the economic daily Wall Street Newspaper - and she is assessing the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is concerned with obtaining a permit which the US Energy Commission will deliberate on, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially considering that just in Alaska, the Usa are still extracting oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, who travel the sea energy route, and the amounts invested to date, although their details are not known, indicate an increasing interest, according to observers.
Tecnology to be developed.
The experts talk about a technology still in its early stages, because marine energy does not dispel fears about the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small, and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
Large-scale energy production, however, requires the use of technologies with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are diverse: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys connected to each other.
The wave thrust, which moves the sludge up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
The energy is sent to the shore through underwater cables.
At this time, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending single federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the contrary, is already producing energy for a commercial centre and parking lot using six underwater turbines from the East River of New York.
The movement of water during tides, rotates the blades of turbines, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced that it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to draw energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for the Research of Electric Energy, deserves at this moment, the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable from the wind, the sun, or the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is precisely on tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others, are looking to the coast, have invested $7 and a half million in 2008 and are planning investments of up to $35 million in 2009.
