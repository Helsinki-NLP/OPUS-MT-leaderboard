A Republican Strategy to Counter Obama's Re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Centre considers it a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments enacted new laws from 2009 on making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new electoral laws require electors to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on polling day, and remove the right of citizens with judicial records to vote.
Prior to the 2006 elections, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to impose such a requirement.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the law of Indiana.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other States.
Over the past two years, they have sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike in Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have universal identity cards such as the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of U.S. citizens, or 21 million people of voting age, do not have photo ID cards issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such identification.
However, it often costs more than $100 to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
Twenty-five per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 per cent of citizens over the age of 65 and 20 per cent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
Much more.
Students, who are considered to vote more for democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, the same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the republican side to use the cards issued by those clubs to vote.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
However, it appears that two out of three Hispanic voters favour the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators sponsored laws abolishing voter registration on election day in eight states in 2011.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to electors wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of approximately 10 million citizens.
However, measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the registration rate of new voters by 17 per cent in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the advance voting period.
For example, at the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the electors who voted in advance were African Americans, while they represented only 13% of the state's voters.
The same was true of the Hispanics.
They represented only 11 per cent of the voters, but 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
In return, white voters who made up 76 per cent of the voters represented only 46 per cent of the electors voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetos of the Democratic Governors.
The US Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of photo identification cards.
Nevertheless, the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that were passed and see it as an obvious objective to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed by the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Screening for prostate cancer: take the test or not?
Indeed, the APS test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative results or false positives, which would lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
This is why men who are already reluctant to take screening tests are even more reluctant to do so.
Take the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two specialists.
In studies in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between control groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have firm recommendations.
Another study, the European one, concluded that there was a difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who had not.
This study also showed, with follow-up after 12 years, that you are 30-40% more likely to have metastases if you are not detected.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if we have a direct relative who has had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also at greater risk.
The key is to make the right decision once we've detected cancer.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are painless.
There is a real need to make the patient understand the level of risk of cancer, by providing them with the possible options, by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and by opting instead, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who are diagnosed with cancer will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
We're going to suggest active surveillance and if the disease progresses, we're going to offer them treatment.
More and more, precise criteria are being established for deciding who should or should not be treated.
So I still recommend taking the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether we should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite advances in research, the adoption of good lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering.
It is estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one ever smoked, this rate would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
On the other hand, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by inheritance.
Many also remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, tobacco control remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Cigarette smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several others.
This is very damaging to people's health.
"Today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesperson André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer falls by half.
Weight
Overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease, according to CSC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research has shown that regular physical activity over a lifetime protects against colon cancer," it says.
Food
It also recommends limiting its consumption of red meat.
In too much, it increases the risk of colorectal cancer.
The meats too, and they should be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting may result in the formation of carcinogens.
"These can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," it says.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this time.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to CSC.
While one noted a decrease in prostate cancer risk, another noted an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is also unclear.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of discussing his concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Taking a screening test doesn't give you cancer."
The Higgs boson shelled
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole emotion, last summer, and for cause.
It is indeed believed that this boson participates in the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, just that.
And then it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model - our best, or "less worse" explanation of the nature and behaviour of matter - but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that this is the Higgs.
We know without a doubt that we are holding an authentic new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data released this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seem to confirm this, but there is still a lack of data to be absolutely certain.
Let us assume that this is the Higgs, since the chances of error seem slim, and let's see what this is all about.
There is, in this world, a fatally unavoidable law that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to break that rule - and don't try too hard, you're gonna hurt yourself.
But even if particle physics is a strange world, it turns out that it also has such a law: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state" - this "state" consisting roughly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicists classify particles into two categories.
In one corner, there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's principle.
And in the other, the bosons, a dirty bunch of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least, not for that principle, which means they can actually be in the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, moreover) The Particle Adventure, of the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not deal with here, and the "particles of force," by which the great forces of nature propagate and to which the boson of Higgs would be somehow related.
These bosons, as we must point out here, are not all as exotic as we might think.
In fact, if you can read this column, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "particle of light," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes its direction, it "interferes" with the electromagnetic field in this particular place, a bit like a pebble thrown into a pond.
From this "disturbance" arises an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore, one of the bosons "force carriers."
More stable field
The same is true of the Higgs boson, except that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you have to reach very, very high energies, a little as if it were a frozen pond whose only very large rock could ride the surface.
That's why it takes a huge particle accelerator like the CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring of 27 km of circumference! - to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between Higgs and mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on to itself on a fridge.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do do have a mass, while the others (like the photon, yours) do not.
Now, what can "bring" all this research, Ms. Plamondon asks?
For science, it is used to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to scrutinize any discrepancies between MS observations and predictions.
There are also many who would like to be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and close some holes in the Model.
This one, it must be said, still has huge deficiencies, proposing no explanation for gravity (oups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).
But we haven't found such discrepancies at CERN so far.
Impact
The implications of this research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. Tout-le-Monde are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will be none.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They could see scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - initially saw the laser as a "lab gadget."
Imagine...
And then the applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 during his optical work.
This sensor, although not at all its original intention, now serves as the "eye" for all digital cameras in the world, and has earned it the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC will necessarily transform our lives, but it means that, really, we never know...
Palliative care - The best way to die...; Le Devoir
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is about to resume as a bill is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
Le Devoir tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that swallowed him had given him a two-year respite.
"They gave me five years to live, I made seven years," he said, half-fig, half-grape, lying in bed at Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care House in Beloeil, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The disease does its job: a huge weakness that prevents it from going alone to the toilet, and even eating alone.
Attracted to an appetizing lunch, he agreed to let himself be helped to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he can even smile, speaks to strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for me to be cured of diarrhea, which is humiliating," he confides.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In our life, we learn that a man is peeing on his feet," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Regaining to the child's stage, for some people, is unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the ability of the person to accept regression," he says.
For, in the opinion of many palliative care workers, great moments are taking place at the very heart of this regression.
Patients entering the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Care Home all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this point, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer provides "curative" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "conscious and stifled."
But the disease made me discover my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't have any more wishes in life," she says, before she accepts a mask to help her breathe.
Nevertheless, in the coming days, she is awaiting a final visit from her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, body care and food assistance are provided.
It is palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little when you know you all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues under the best possible conditions, says Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Whether it's physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
When dying, brandy or Pepsi will be accepted for oral care, depending on the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, his son will finish the beer at the deceased's feet.
"We help loved ones as well as patients," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
At the Victor-Gadbois house, the days follow each other but do not resemble each other.
Alongside an old 93-year-old man who savors his last family assembly in the courtyard, well stocked in his pillows while being tricked in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient has reached the terminal stage of his or her life, whether at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And many organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Société de soins palliatives à domicile du Grand Montréal, specialize more or less exclusively in cancer care.
It is precisely this great deficiency in Quebec's health care that has led several palliative care physicians to fear the adoption of a law governing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care leaders including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to testify to their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health care system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone will be entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient spend 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without the necessary steps being taken to relieve her.
I'm afraid patients only ask to die because they don't get the proper care.
And at the same time, many oncologists are struggling with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard's expectations of survival were already minimal when she gave up hard chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
Yet she told me I was finished!
Not all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank caregivers for not having met their request after they were relieved of their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Director of Palliative Care at the Société de soins palliatives à domicile du Grand Montréal, 8% of patients are refractory to pain treatments.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which amounts to sleeping until the patient's death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved patient will have the opportunity to have this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to euthanize me," it means "I want to be relieved."
This report was made possible through a journalism award from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road officials, construction contractors, fund-raisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell daily what they know about a formidable "system," mixing construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that cost Quebec taxpayers very much, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's curious how the system has been crumbling since we took the big money," ironises Jacques Duchesneau, MP for Quebec City and former Montreal police chief.
It was through him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a fundamental investigation into the misappropriation of road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then Liberal Prime Minister, Jean Charest, had consented only backwards.
The "Duchesneau report" established a direct link between industry, hidden party financing and corruption of civil servants.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010," he points out, "the only Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion on contracts," some of them quenching their instincts to get a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, hoping that it will "demonstrate the schemes behind individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also working with its army of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Plus the officers of the "Marteau squad" who, since 2009, would have led Montreal's "sewer cartel" to put the pedal soft on contract swings...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial searches and laid charges of fraud and corruption against municipal officials, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburb town.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who had just resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec.
He is suspected of having pawned bribes repeatedly in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers at the Montreal Road and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are also formally charged.
The latter made a sensation by explaining to the committee the mechanics of the "system" for obtaining public contracts.
For years, he paid 3% of the value of the contracts he obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who was returning the money to Union Montréal, Mayor Gérald Tremblay's party.
Mr. Zambito sowed to all winds in the 2000s, giving more than C $88,000 (approximately EUR 68,000) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted that he had organized an illegal fund-raising for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewage contracts with higher costs
In Montreal, the corruption "system" functioned smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, described it well in front of the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction companies, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey games and bribes totalling $736,000, in exchange for sewage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road officials have confessed to having their feet greased by inflating invoices from 30% to 40%, through false extras.
Then an organizer of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget feeding his cashiers with dirty money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected officials to raise the alarm.
Mayor of the borough of Rivière-des-Prairies, east of the island, she has been protesting since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land bought $5 million and sold... $1.6 million to developers, in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% dirty money in election campaigns
From the investigation that will finally be put in place, she says that she "pulls on a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and pin the wrongdoers."
The process, she says, is "painful but positive."
We're cleaning up the wound, but it would take a Montréal-specific investigation unit and a watch, not to see suspicious practices come back.
Like we're cleaning up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes, for his part, that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars," but is especially concerned about the role of "elected officials who are aware of the scheme," when they were not soaking in the magouille!
Estimating 70% of the amount of dirty money in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, he ironically said: "I was told that it was only a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100, but this will not change the situation: "Until election expenses are strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocated a complete revision of the system of awarding public contracts and party financing: "We cannot go any further; going to the bottom of things, courageously, will make it possible to rebuild the house on stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Duchesneau invites those who laugh about it to look in their own courtyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you have taken on a new dimension with the PSG.
How do you explain this progression?
This can be explained not only by individual awareness but also by the new dimension of the GMP.
Great players have arrived.
Every day, I make progress on their side.
The technical staff also brought me a lot.
On a daily basis, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
And, in the game, it's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not burning.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine's pre-training centre to my visit to Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed in stages.
So you take advantage of the competition installed by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's recruits are used to playing very high-level games.
They also know that every training is crucial.
Which makes a player like me want to face it and provide the maximum.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is supported by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man in the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no match in League 1 and is one of the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with high-tech clubs.
He's been with some big players.
I think he'll win other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I was getting out of a series of injuries.
His trust in me also explains my performance.
How do you look at the first part of the season of the MTP?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the leader.
But we're still in ambush.
One of our major goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the 8th finals with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we will have our say in the face of very good European teams.
First we want to finish first of our chicken, in front of Porto, in order to be able to receive at the 8th of the final return.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris needs to win titles and sign up for the duration.
Today, that is not the case.
Financially, the MTP is giving itself the means to make this project a reality.
In League 1, not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this title as a champion.
Last season, we didn't go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a really big season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points, we're supposed to be champion...
But another team, Montpellier, has achieved an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think she's the one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are in the fight for the title, I think we have the weapons to win.
Do you think that the media is expecting too much from the MTP?
It's normal for people to expect a lot from us in the light of what's been invested and the players we have.
We totally accept it.
After that, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to blame, it's sure that's a bit frustrating.
You wonder what more people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to set up a game project.
A team is built over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we could answer.
Look at Manchester City, which has not been able to qualify for the 8th finals for two seasons, they have also made huge expenditures!
In terms of the sums invested, you were imagined with 15 points in advance at the truce!
It was neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can have a smile by telling ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Well, good for us to say there's a Zlatan addiction.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and sets many goals.
He came here for that and he proves he's the star of League 1.
He has demonstrated everywhere he's been that he's a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the men he has around him.
What he did was truly exceptional.
This pushes others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, is also making progress for everyone.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French team?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to take part in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grappling with play time.
I saw things there and came out stronger.
Today, I manage to make good matches in selection.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blue.
Lessons have been learned from what has happened in Ukraine, and we now need to behave in an exemplary manner.
What look do you take on the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blue?
He's got the results for him.
We're well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The breeder is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the win.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the Blue to Brazil.
Is the good draw (1-1) drawn in Spain on October 16 a founding match?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never had a match like this in my career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
The opposite is true of current exchange rates, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, which is made up of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows peer-to-peer file exchange.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A small thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin price, after reaching a peak of $30 (€23) in June 2011, dropped to $2, five months later, before returning today around $10 (prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to world trade in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency," "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies."
Bitcoin stands out from other types of virtual currency such as "credits," used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
But each time, a central authority controls and processes exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are both account book depositories, auditors, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Except that a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double key encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the bitcoins exchanged exist in the public accounts book, which is distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge to computers, whose winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding this additional line.
This is a file hash phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a shorter, single digital fingerprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before "chopping" the whole.
The aim is to find the number that gives a particular impression (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right number.
The transaction is then indestructively linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to defraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other one remains orphan because the two have different prints.
The computer that solved the challenge won 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this award is halved regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves some margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also noted with each increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin were attacked and bitcoins in stolen deposits.
"The fault used does not concern the protocol itself," says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this flaw.
Weighing actors like Wikipedia refuse gifts of this nature.
Others, like the WordPress blog platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that nearly 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, "giant balances" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of an educational book on this currency, believes very much in the potential of this technology as a network of transactions.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement in merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
All they need to do is communicate an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize," says Pierre Noizat, who assures thousands of users.
There is a general movement to challenge hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for Bitcoin to take over, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to reassess the various risks, now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Suo).
NATO and the Americans are expected to follow in late 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take over its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is the Afghan peasants that we have punished by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the maimed.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often peasants who refuse the foreign armed presence, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arab, Uzbek, Tajik.
Tolerable, sometimes assisted by local insurgents, they will no longer be helped when the Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French credits, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armoured vehicles reached Kabul without being attacked, overflown by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban outburst into Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country on fire and bloodshed as a result of the struggles between different factions.
Their takeover of the country was then seen as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of those peasants who have been overtaken by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahedin, Afghan government and current Taliban are joining in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main leaders of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They turned into businessmen, grabbing government land to sell it to refugees returning from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracting contracts.
They have disregarded themselves; most of them have not fought themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American largesse: the flight of capital is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They met the modern world during their exils in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the benefits.
Approximately 65 per cent of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, government schools are full of girls and boys alike.
Work will have to be provided to these young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opponents, are fond of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish soap operas, which present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with rebuilding provincial militias, which will escape central government.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a degree of decentralization, similar to Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, abolishing the post of Prime Minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, particularly during the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and before.
No industry has been re-established, no dams are in operation, no major irrigation systems are being repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to private initiative.
In a country ruined by 30 years of war, government control over infrastructure would have been necessary.
There was a widespread rumour that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
This only added to the feeling that Westerners were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on site, or transportation to export it across the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left Mes Aynak's copper mine, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to search the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's largest employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need one day to restore normal relations.
The departure of the French fighting troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aids: lycée de filles, de garçons, département de français à l'université, Institut français, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support to the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, in an attempt to "win the hearts and minds" and to carry out the impossible task of matching aids and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" department of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), abolished in 2012, has carried out, and had carried out by a small French NGO, numerous works of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain villages.
This work, which was greeted with local labour, was able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cropland.
What will we leave as a souvenir, after two billion euros in military spending?
A much smaller budget would contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often above 2,000 metres above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in Kapisa Province.
In order to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which the farmers told me they wanted, small, well-controlled civil aid should be maintained for them, which directly affects them.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
This is another poker shot by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, it has decided to play its vantage point.
Taking everyone short, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the following day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State gave this House two more months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text for almost two years, several times amended which undermines institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative has only increased the gap in the country.
For his opponents, the President persevered in his "autocratic delusion," continuing to "betray his word" and "trampling on the law."
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible, by speeding up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time which obliges the Brothers to give up their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way of regaining popular and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
All the more so since this use of a hasty vote is the ultimatum of the Egyptian people: "Either you vote for my text or I retain full powers," which are supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It was in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, overwhelmingly Islamist, voted for the text yesterday.
Most Liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slapped the door, believing that they had not been able to put forward their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society had done the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added in haste yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Unsurprisingly, it was most often unanimously that the articles were voted on.
Commentators also amused themselves by the fact that one of the only differences of the day was expressed around... the hour of prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the constituent's pendulum was not well settled.
The text, which was still being voted on last night, contains 234 articles.
In the end, article 2 remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, stipulating that "the principles of sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the "establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace" principles "with" rules, "which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a sign of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," replied the Liberals, who only saw it as a communication blow.
For according to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
These include article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular in verifying the conformity of laws with sharia law.
According to Egypt's expert Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see the beginnings of a theocracy. "
The Liberals' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next president of this university should be much less moderate than the current one.
"For the time being, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil register.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not ulema but academics, for some trained in the French system "tempered Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes "that there may be ambiguity around Article 220, because the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
Reference is made to the "fiqh" in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question may arise in the future as to the extent to which civilian judges are competent to rule on it. "
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized because of the extensive powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another contentious issue is the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the review of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Nor will trials of civilians in military courts be prohibited, as called for by human rights associations.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticide.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, including the press.
In addition, there is no longer any article that reflects the protection of women, Human Rights Watch's Heba Morayef points out.
In her view, the only positive point was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will parade them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of brine await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Land brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has chosen five major reasons to visit Israel.
Go and worship the holy places
A must-see rendez-vous: the banks of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that whoever penetrates these "baptismal funds" will be touched by the divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
It is in this particular place that Jesus appeared before his disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
Believers walk through the Rue de la Souffrance or the Way of the Cross (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This road begins near the Antonia fortress (the Praetory), where the trial was held, and then leads by the streets of the old city to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, and then to that of the Stone of the Onction and the Tomb.
Here lies the Christian centre of the world, a symbol of the salvation of humanity.
According to the Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected at the place where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified was grown.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations, which is the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave there small words with prayers that are then answered.
Travel high
Visit the ruins of the Massada fortress, former refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are located on the steep rocks of a mountain 450 m above sea level.
Only mountaineers can go by their own means.
For the others, a cable car takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1 600 and 2 040 m above sea level, is the ski resort of Mont Hermont, which welcomes many tourists during the winter.
A shuttle can take you there from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes are a total of 45 km long.
The old beliefs are that heathen gods once lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
This country houses nearly 300 museums.
It was impossible to visit all of them during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that are really worth a visit.
First of all: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the ancient manuscripts of Qumran, or Dead Sea manuscripts, discovered in the caves of the Judea Desert, as well as nearly 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
Also to be seen: Tel Aviv Art Museum.
The paintings of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso are exhibited.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths made up of mouldings of the visitors and the watchmen of the time.
Once in Caesarea, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you can admire Rodin sculptures.
There are no guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum or Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which returns to the most dramatic historical pages in history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children exterminated in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into total darkness.
Stars sparkle.
You then hear the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and welfare
Israel's three major resorts are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each offers swimming pools, water parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you can swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the temperature of the water does not drop below 21 ° while that of the air can reach 23 °.
The Dead Sea is even hotter and you can swim all year round.
By the way, this is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point of the Earth, 417 m below sea level.
Azure-coloured water contains brine and very easily retains swimmers, even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are of surreal beauty.
We come here to treat with salt water, silt, curative sludge and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to just relax.
Discover the secrets of Antiquity
They are guarded by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists particularly enjoy walking in the narrow alleys that bear the name of the signs of the zodiac.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to "your" sign, fate will smile at you.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds who have come to take pictures of all Israel and even other countries.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theatre, "conquering" the fortress of the Crusaders.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, notably Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to tourists
If you leave for Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, because they are easily exchangeable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equivalent to 3.8 shekels).
With regard to urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and upper parts of the city.
It's almost an underground funicular.
The journey to all types of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1: 30.
In Israel, Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, markets, shops and public transport cease to operate.
And the work week starts on Sunday morning.
Many cafés, restaurants and hotels only serve kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, scaleless fish and dishes made of both milk and meat.
It offers a multitude of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made from coconut milk, but also hummus, traditional Jewish paste, various sauces, ground chickpea balls, falafel, fruit and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
On the other hand, there are a lot of well-fed cats who walk the haughty air.
They can be seen sleeping at night on the rooftops of parked cars.
These felins love passing places and do not refuse to be enjoyed.
Car rental varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs $15 a day.
Rent a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Admission to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mostly people coming to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 miles of Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
"Who language has, in Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While MPs and human rights activists are polemics about what the law on compulsory language testing will give, fraudsters selling "fake" certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are nationals of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families at home.
Since 1 December, a law had entered into force stipulating that every migrant worker would have to pass an examination in Russian.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, personal services and retail sectors.
However, with time, promises the Federal Migration Service, the tests will become compulsory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will be necessary to validate the knowledge of the language, but also of the history of Russia and the foundations of law.
It will be necessary to validate his knowledge of the Russian language in order to obtain and renew his work permit.
Only nationals of countries where Russian is an official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained educational certificates or diplomas before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not covered by this law.
Benefit, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of examination centres will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Peoples' Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to take examinations in all the cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the country.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Service.
But before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already asked the question in the press many times: what will it give?
What will the obligation to know Russian change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering "from slavery to work."
Many talk about defending the rights of migrant workers, says the director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problems of foreign workers at 90%.
The problems arise for migrants without a profession, without training, those who do not know the language and do not have medical certificates.
Without understanding the language, Sebelev certifies, the future migrant is destined to meet dishonest people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him with a "journey" to an overcrowded house where he and dozens of his fellow men will torment themselves for months without food and without paper and will have to commute between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive numerous complaints from our migrants.
"At home, they are promised something, and when they arrive, they are cheated, they take their passports, and they do not receive the salary," confirms the Head of the Directorate of Migration Services for the work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't argue with me, police officer!
However, many Central Asian nationals who wish to come to Russia to earn money confide that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they wish to go, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
It is of course not their fault, but their misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajiks can afford even fair primary education.
Their families don't even have enough food to feed their children, not to mention dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach adolescence, these young people leave to earn money as soon as the opportunity arises.
It's hard when you don't know the language, they confide.
"You feel diminished and weakened."
However, human rights defenders note an important aspect of the language law.
The examinations will be intended only for migrants with legal status.
Without status, there will be no formal review or work thereafter.
Yet most migrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or defense to enter"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barriers and always these linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles rubles.
And then we can get a fake recording quickly for just 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we do not have a record, hence the cases of extortion.
"They are asking us 100, 200 rubles for cigarettes and tea," said journalists Umed Khouchkadamov, a national of Tajikistan.
"Make it quick, don't lash and buy yourself a beautiful piece of art."
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it was discovered that the registration documents of migrants were not the only ones to be false.
Several false certificates of language examinations have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
The forged papers come out of an ordinary color printer.
Of course, their new owners had nothing to do with them: each migrant who hoped to make it easier to take the examinations had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: it will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree that the short-term objective is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these "pieces of paper."
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the examination on the first occasion the time to take language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not deal with the arms market
The share of crimes involving legal weapons is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to tighten the law against civilian weapons carriers.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents, whether it be the shooting at weddings or the killing organized by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven people.
The police want to ban the use of rubber bullets in public places and raise the legal age for obtaining a licence to carry a weapon from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee for Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that amendments to the Arms Act would be introduced into the State Duma shortly.
Not everyone is happy to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "tightening the screw."
An open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demanded to abandon "this senseless hardening."
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered weapon is minimal, said the Russian service Vasiliy Lesnikov, a lawyer and crime specialist for the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, over a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services, while 1,168 thousand crimes were registered in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that strengthening civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from accessing the black market.
According to them, any weapon can be found in Moscow today for a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it controls the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factory to officer
The black arms market is provided through several channels.
There are five main channels, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served 10 years in the Department of Education and Headquarters.
Screenshot from a site taking orders for weapons
The first is the "military trace," that is, the weapons that were stolen during military operations in the Caucasus.
"These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians," Baranets explains.
The second type of black market weapons is those stolen from law enforcement agencies by criminals.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen from police stocks and those stolen directly from law enforcement officials.
The illegal pistols go for sale from the military warehouses.
Many of these have often been exploded.
"Certified versions indicate that some fires were deliberately triggered to conceal the deficit," explains the former member.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers have something to do with it.
"We see private arms factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and sell weapons on the black market, especially in Moscow," says an expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A large proportion of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
"There is local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia has been formed and organizes the supply," adds the former military officer.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on this issue was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data from weapons portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, researchers explain, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of the weapons on the black market were found there "because of employees whose work is related to weapons," the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places of military conflict, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "clandestine searches."
A salesman and consultant from an arms store who asked to remain anonymous assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these search specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, the sellers will pick up the new goods from the military warehouses.
The person buys through a sign a unit, such as a TT pistol.
We deliver it to him by passing the merchandise through a fence.
"He transports it to the city and sells it for 900 €by the unit with two chargers," he says.
"It is true that the police are aware of all the cases, so, when crimes are about to be solved, they make a purchase of control from illegal arms dealers," the seller adds.
"Like in a deluxe shop"
The seller and buyer are usually found through knowledge.
I looked at websites, blogs, until a guy showed up and offered to come to Begovaya station where someone would take me to a "corner" to bargain.
The price of the gun was given to me on the spot.
Victor Baranets as a military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the salesman. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there is also a need to come and say, for example, "From such a person, who asked me to report that his daughter has lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a pair of American fists with the help of someone I trust.
He only delivers them to me because he knows I won't give them to me.
The new kids are looking for guns in different ways.
Former soldier Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The patterns, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album in which there was "everything we want."
"I thought I was in a deluxe shop," the soldier remembers.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I'm not just buying, we're going with the salesman in the forest and setting up a target.
"They let me shoot, and when I'm convinced that the gun is working well, we start negotiating," says the expert.
A shop from her couch
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where you can buy weapons "for different uses."
To do this, we don't need any documents and no one to meet.
"It's enough to have a specific amount of money," they write in advertising on the website "Buy a gun or a combat machine gun."
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
And we sell to the miners?
"Without a permit, of course," asks user "Ivan" (retained spelling).
"Buy TT. Moscow," writes "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.

I have heard of this type of scheme: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take over.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic terminals.
"He receives in return a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," explains the secretary of the "Right to a Weapon" association, Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets says that by applying on the site, you can find yourself without a weapon and behind bars.

One Makarov for $100
The purchase of an illegal firearm, according to experts, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Weapon" association, one can buy a Makarov pistol for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait about a month and a half.
It was removed from the long-term warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official data from the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the overall number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent to 22.9 miles, while confirmed cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosive substances and bombs decreased by 7.8 per cent.
United States: Employees of fast foods and supermarkets on strike
Nearly a quarter of American teenagers go through cashier work at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has been waged against the low wages of Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time being, no one can predict whether this wave is going to grow or become rapidly exhausted.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing associations.
In parallel with the increase in the low wages received by basic employees at Walmart and in fast food chains, the organisers of the events want to see the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not currently covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, "Black Friday," at a time when a pouring rain of sales grabbing millions of people hit America and sometimes triggering events.
On that day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs to organize pickets with trade unions and left-wing activists in the company's stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and medium classes.
Walmart markets everything: from diapers to hunting rifles to car batteries, vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
This is why many low-paid employees at Walmart shop only at their place of work.
Price and product choice have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
They also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or portable scanners.
The participants of the "Black Friday" protests demanded an increase in salary, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 per month.
For Walmart's base employee who receives $9.5 an hour, that's a sum he can't afford.
Scientists at Berkley University in California show that if Walmart increased the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it currently spends.
If Walmart transferred all the wage increases to the shoulders of consumers, every race in the store would cost them 46 cents more.
They'll spend only $12.39 more in a year than they do now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not harm the group.
"Black Friday" continued in stores from 8: 00 a.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold 5,000 items per second over this period.
Its cashiers carried out a total of 100 million transactions for "Black Friday."
Dan Fogleman's spokesperson assured in an interview at the left Huffington Post site that "less than five" Walmart employees had left their posts and that the protest was only a "com operation" among so many others "on the part of the organizing union.
"Next customer!"
The protests continued this week in New York City and were no longer about the Walmart stores (in this progressive city, they are not very popular, which is why they are not yet established there) but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay you for the work you did honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast foods increase them over time, but by little, on average, its core employees reach New York $8.90 per hour.
Nobody touches less than them in this town.
For me it's unthinkable to live with that sum in New York.
There was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw it as their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I find myself interviewing McDonald's employees who complain about having to live with this salary and sometimes having to feed their children with it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there are comments saying that it is irresponsible to make children if you do not know what you are going to feed them with.
Protesters who launched the movement on Thursday at 6: 30 a.m. near McDonald's on 40th Street and on Madison Avenue demanded that fast-food cashiers and cooks be paid at least $15 an hour, more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also called for the establishment of trade unions in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing union protesters through harassment or dismissal.
However, the administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a union, taking over fast food is still a difficult task, and for real reasons.
One of the most important is the extraordinary turnover of staff.
They don't agree.
Other tumultuous demonstrations were held near several other fast food chains.
The highlight of the protest was the gathering in the middle of the day near McDonald's in Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including Jumaane Williams, a member of the City Council, who said: "McDonald's announces selling billions of servings and then they don't even give you sick leave and don't pay for the work you've done honestly!"
The protesters were supported by other New York democrats in sight, including Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we all need to support fast food workers so that they get a fair wage and the economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves.
The New York Times characterized this event as the most important event in the fast food industry in its history.
But only a few hundred people participated, and not all of them were fast food workers, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
For the moment it is difficult to say whether this spark of mass movement will make small ones.
"For the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain"
Recently, fans of new technologies have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, Google unveiled its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was reported that Microsoft had applied for the patent.
However, it appears from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group of the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for scientists of this company, glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, by the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Could you tell us in a few words what your research group is doing?
- We are working on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we are trying to widen the boundaries of this interaction.
For the moment, humanity as a whole has remained flat-screen pixels and sometimes tactile.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in control by gesture.
- What does the future hold for us too?
- Although the Kinect has made the interaction physical, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Information capture has been improved (the system is receiving more data), but performance, for the time being, has not really been improved.
We're trying to change this and we're working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We have to get the computer world out of ours, into the physical world, make it more tactile.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the surrounding space.
In this way, we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And for starters, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's appreciated, but isn't she overestimated?
One cannot say that it is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because one does not always want to inform others of his actions or his intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but each one in its niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather discrete, restricted gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera, but by a hand-worn bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a watch.
In fact, the future will be marked by mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you that can?
You would do it with words and gestures.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, this is gonna be hard to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at some point?
- Not necessarily, but it's a matter of mutual rapprochement.
I think that very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will enable us to better identify man's reactions.
These can be laser sensors, they produce fairly good resolution in depth and this is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what don't you like about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we base our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c / s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
Compared to this last point, all the current technologies are quite good, this adds work to the algorithms designers.
It is necessary to keep in mind the resolution in X and Y axes, but also in Z.
Speed also matters a lot, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the 30 c / s are really not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche of our Redmond lab gave the sensor touch a steady processing delay of between 1 and 100 µs, with the current sensors closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how this influences the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device like this in my work, but I don't need to touch, to get more frames at the second.
- But shouldn't we increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other, a receiver of the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a usual sensor of the visible field.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
A lot of cameras could solve this problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera curve and see how it could help define locations.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don't you think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, walking around all the time with a smartphone with your hands raised is not practical but here's what I think: the best option would be a "transient" augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to switch glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that's what makes them strong (the personal elements are the only ones you see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the handling of virtual holographic objects in the air is no longer accessible only to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the mere mortal.
There is a problem that opponents of this idea point their finger at: there is no touch!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my classes, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could be the addition of tactile sensations.
For the moment, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
She's recording the pressure perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really intended to attribute palpability to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed towards a precise point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of a breath of air on the ends of the fingers.
There are also the bracelets worn on the wrists that influence nerve endings of the fingers, they are also an axis of work with perspectives.
- And you tried to cheat the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should normally feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
There is still one task below which it will take a long time to get hurt: how to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he is walking in an almost infinite open space - we are working on the concepts of treadmills (nothing to do with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
For the moment, we can only moderately deceive the brain, there are still many years of work to be done.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Le avant-garde pétersbourgeois" dedicated to the city dwellers who are in advance, in the avant-garde of culture and art
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the artistic scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the city and who have found recognition in Europe, after having been known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extrovert painter Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, this rather bearded man, all dressed red that you can meet near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in trendy parties and vernissages.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather crowds, no matter where they are exhibited.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical petersbourgeois storytellers, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is a prominent representative of the Petersbourgeois vanguard of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in a good mood.
He recently took into his hands an organ of Barbarie and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg since he had matured enough for this difficult role because of his existence, his philosophy and his image as a Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you walk around the city in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue, for example?
- I chose red as a designer specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society everything that is not grey causes aggression and negative agitation.
But my provocations are meant to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize you had to be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized it was my way.
So, the wave of old unofficial painters had passed and the new, free painters, like me, were misunderstood.
I began to bond with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchchina which gave birth to "Pushinskaya-10" and then there was no wave.
I'm interested in theatre, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to be in the centre of St. Petersburg culture where the best creative forces have to come together.
In 1995, I took up my place in Pushkinskaya-10, which was home to a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the Pedersbourguese bohemian bohemian.
Many were born there: NAMES, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour arrive with the project "The ear of Van Gogh."
Chnour and his friends sang easy play-back songs in tight jerseys, among them Igor Vdovin, a fashionable composer today.
When the band started performing live, it became "Leningrad."
Trakhtenberg had a lot of shows before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his basic training and education, it was at home that he received them.
Galerie "D137," Club "Griboiedov": these are the repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees left as regulars.
I'm a hero of the past century, of the time when culture meant something.
In 2000, a poll was held in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city."
I was named "Painter of the Year," and that's when my reign ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
- Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very good news and acuity.
I'm going to have a scheduled exhibition "The Russian Museum Through the Clowns."
Clowns belong to a timeless category.
Before I was a social person, today it hurts and it scares to be that way.
But with the clowns, everything fades, the tragic falls.
I like grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through total and compulsory disguise.
Today, it is the habit that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him a hand, but we have to spit in his face.
And the lie will be erased by disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the organ player of Barbarie.
Who else than me can play it.
- But maybe commercial art can be beautiful, too?
- Today commercial art must be careful, delicate, liquorous.
A disintegration of culture is taking place.
People used to be divided into flocks, bohemians loved one thing, denied another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar ticket to please everyone.
Today, you have to think about who you're going to like.
Each star has 100 fans.
- But thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhailov!
- It's people we threw away who come to see him, it's the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come, and in the end it is less management, money, everything is lost.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I was painting paintings that a collector hung next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually the ones you paint at the end of your life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
They say: there is the spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with it.
I am a representative of yesterday's culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money just for painting.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the Culture Officer.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of good tsars, it wasn't like that, the tsars didn't understand culture well, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
In Moscow, there are good consultants today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are out of the question, because we need higher experts who will properly evaluate these experts and find a way for them.
At present, it is the "reign of taste" that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that they honestly say that they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find other museums.
- For you, what is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a soil for it.
And on our stones, art has a hard time growing.
We need a cultural soil and we have more writers than readers, it's bad.
In Europe, there are a lot of curious people going to see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this layer is very thin.
We must make art fashionable as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the St. Petersburg Scholarship
Draw up in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Space shuttle caravans with Earthlings on board set out to search for a rescue planet.
To save humanity, a great question arises: how can we continue to make our species live in weightlessness or on a rescue planet?
I don't think there's much choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
"This is Venus and Mars," says Vladimir Sourdine, researcher of the State Astronomical Institute P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the surface temperature of Venus is 500.
You can only live there at very high altitude or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to focus on the issues of reproduction in space, focusing on the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of pea grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then we put in orbit insects, small breeding drosophile flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to see how a weightless embryo developed.
At the exit we get a completely normal chick.
It is then that the problems begin.
"The problem is that the chick has to find a support, he has to get on his feet and start moving," explains the laboratory director of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
By not finding any support, the chicks were agitating in a disorderly manner.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely atrophy.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
Unfortunately, they would simply die after four days.
"We took their eyes off twice, then we gave up, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, noting the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
The last biological "miniature arch" with animals was sent into orbit 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, Bion biosatellite will only carry species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their foetus into space.
In principle, nothing supernatural has been discovered.
"It was still the biosatellites, and then it's the only experiment. We need to do this kind of research," said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats gave birth to their offspring.
However, reproductions are not yet able to be carried out directly in space.
It's no small deal.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike beasts, man is capable of doing so, in principle.
Homo sapiens has abstract thought, he is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the feminine organism is the most precious thing mankind has.
Our seagull flew away and no one on Earth could tell if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the robbery
"Nobody answered this question," explains Vakhtang Vatchnadze, retired from the rocket and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first cosmonaut woman Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolayev was also cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second cosmonaut woman Svetlana Savitskaya, having been in orbit twice and even working in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and give birth to a healthy offspring after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
Yet humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravitation.
Cosmonaute Preparation Centre Hydrology Laboratory: Mandatory Phase of Flight Preparation
Here, in zero buoyancy, cosmonauts train at extra-vehicular exits.
Water mimics weightlessness.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for infants, it is their real element.
Small amphibious men seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
Since the baby evolves for about 9 months in the lymphatic fluid of his mother's stomach, it is easier for him to get used to the water.
It makes sense, in principle, because from birth to first bath, only 2 weeks are spent.
"It's very little to forget," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the child who has just been born weightlessness is a more natural state, the woman needs gravitation, a force of weight.
In weightlessness, the muscles of the stomach and the pelvis atrophy very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
All right, let's ignore that by relying on birth simulators.
We can of course prepare a delivery in a special room, the woman will manage to get him out.
"What then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite us to reflect on this complex issue.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravitation.
If it does not feel the earthly attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or muscle system.
You can't dress an infant like an adult with a special training suit.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return to Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," says Igor Pestov, Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
The birth of children in space is still a matter of theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the Earthlings travel in their shuttles to a distant planet that will become the home of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Supreme Audit Institution) said: "the control of pseudo self-employment (in Czech" Švarc system ") has failed because of politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and quality legislation, but it is lagging behind in its implementation.
This was stated by Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Institution in an interview for Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that is what is lacking in us," Kala said in her commentary on the current situation.
A joint inspection by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cited Petr Nečas' approach to the "Švarc system" as an example of abusive practice.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it forbids something, even the head of government cannot stop an inspecting authority from demanding compliance with the law," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you referred to a Czech-German project in which the public procurement laws of these two countries were compared.
What was the specific question?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and specific national legislation and a practice itself.
We have gathered all this together and, although this control procedure has not yet been completed, very interesting differences have emerged: generally speaking, our legislation may be "more stringent and of better quality," but, according to certain parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This confirms, therefore, that it is not enough to continually develop increasingly detailed rules but that it is necessary to devote ourselves to the very implementation of the law.
How can this project help you in practice and what does it mean for you?
Common control of this kind should help us to stop trying to clarify the laws, to lower and to improve the thresholds, where this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But lowering market thresholds will not necessarily achieve this objective.
It may be that this system is so overwhelmed by red tape, that those who seek its faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal problems with the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an institution similar to our SAI or a different way of organizing?
As for the institutions, like the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof operates there, which is organised in a similar way, it also has a council constituted somewhat differently, but these two institutions basically proceed in a similar way.
The powers are also, to a certain extent, similar, however with a degree of similarity to our system: since Germany is a federal structure, it also has similar rates of account at the level of the various Länder.
The HRB can only control federal money, which in our case is the same as the state's resources.
The public funds managed at home by the regions and municipalities are controlled there at the level of the Länder 'accounts.
As far as national legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
I would not like to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model, but one cannot say that it does better in all areas.
Maybe it's because they have better detectives?
No, probably not, but I repeat, I don't have any comparison data.
However, it must also be said that this country, which we regard as a model, also faces a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they wouldn't have any advantage in cooperating with our institution, would they?
As far as national legislation is concerned, what has been meant for you, as an institution, by the amendment of the law on public procurement, are its effects already being felt?
As this amendment has come into force relatively recently, it does not yet have an impact on our monitoring operations.
Since we are carrying out ex post checks, there is a certain delay.
Our observations relate only to the process of preparing future checks at the moment - we have launched a new "risk detection tool" with which we have screened almost 14,000 public contracts - where these changes will of course be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions for certain types of tender procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law to be rather an advantage or an additional burden for the administration?
I believe that this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can arise is that these rules become more stringent and that they cannot be respected.
Already under the previous rules, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programmes) forced the subject to accept that any breach of the law on markets means a breach of budgetary discipline.
So is it really useful to make the law stricter in this way?
No, not that way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or abuse it, but not punish those who make formal errors without affecting the decision-making process.
Such a system will put more pressure on the administration.
So what's the solution to get out of this?
Let's look where we're not going.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with so-called Švarc system controls - what does that mean?
Is the Švarc system prohibited or permitted?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of government cannot prevent an authority from going to inspect and demanding compliance with the law.
He can say: "We will change the law and allow it," but he cannot say that we will act as if nothing were happening.
The Contracts Act contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out, precisely in order to protect tendering.
But it is also tragic that a bidder is eliminated solely because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that, in my opinion, is what is lacking in us.
Roads are frozen in places, but most are still practicable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snow-covered.
The network, however, remains largely feasible, in some places with increased vigilance.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Karlovy Vary area, the roads were this morning practicable, but in frozen places and also snowy.
Temperatures have dropped and fluctuate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but are expected to rise slightly during the day.
Snowfall has ceased in the area and only a thin layer of snow remains on the plains.
The ridges of the metal mountains (Krušné hory) are, however, covered with about 30 centimetres of snow.
Data from the Regional Road Maintenance Service indicate that due to fog, visibility was in some places reduced.
The R6 fast track and the national roads in the region are now easy to use.
Vigilance, however, remains to be maintained, for example on certain bridges whose surfaces can be frozen and slippery.
All departmental and third-category roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
Some of their sections are still left with frozen snow and in places filled with traffic.
Especially in areas above sea level, drivers need to increase their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Roads and Highways Directorate reports on its website that some roads in East Bohemia are threatened by ice formation and that snow layers plagued by traffic can be found on roads in mountainous and high-lying areas.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of the risk of ice formation in areas of the Pardubice region at altitude.
There may be ice in the vicinity of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, mainly on departmental and third-category roads.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 around Svitavy were treated chemically.
The snow is mainly found in the Giant Mountains (Krkonoše) and the Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of traffic-packed snow is present on the roads in areas at altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will now be dry, mostly clear, with possible cloudy periods.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will usually fluctuate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen area are now feasible, although in some places it is necessary to be more vigilant and to adapt its driving to the weather conditions.
It's freezing this morning, temperatures range from -3 ° C to -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and subsequent cooling, some lines of communication may be frozen in places.
Drivers can expect to cross fog zones, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is reflected in the information of the Regional Road Maintenance Service.
The D5 motorway is practically easy to use, although road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between kilometers 80 and 131.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some sections may be frozen in the South Pilsen District and in the Tachov District.
The departmental and third-category routes are wet and in this case the warning against frozen sections applies.
Drivers must be vigilant, especially on the less busy roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc region
Drivers travelling to areas of the Olomouc region above sea level must now count on a thick, soft layer of snow on the roads.
This layer remained on the "Červenohorské sedlo" pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after chemical processing operations.
The snowfall forced road maintenance staff to go to the field last night; according to the road services, it fell more than three centimetres in the Šumperk district.
In the other parts of the region, most of the roads are easy to use.
"On the heights of Šumperk district there are snow remains.
Drivers travelling in the direction of Jeseník should expect to meet at the pass called "Červenohorské sedlo" a layer of thick and soft snow "told ČTK today the head of road maintenance services of Šumperk district.
Their colleagues in the Jeseník district also visited the area during the night; according to them, after chemical treatment, the roads are now cleared and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the district of Olomouc the roads are practicable without difficulty, in the district of Šternberk the drivers should however pay attention in the sections in forest areas with still moist roads.
Ústí nad Labem and Liberec regions
As early as this morning, road maintenance services in North Bohemia reported several difficult sections.
According to police data, in addition to some areas covered by snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitudes, so snow and ice should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially to the south east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there are no problems and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been reported at this time.
Road maintenance services reported the presence of ice, particularly in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snowmelt during the day, clear sky and frost during the night.
From the main traffic routes, difficult conditions are also reported on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that bent under the weight of the snow to reach the road.
Šimon Ornest said: "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think of the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
It's just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps we like to fall into.
In our band The Tap Tap, we laugh about it and we think we're the only group able to collect a positive amount of energy in order to push back or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you set up a very unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project in more detail to our readers?
It's a charity we've been preparing for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December at 11.10 a.m.
The day before, on 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously, in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end almost at the end of the Maya calendar on Kiribati Island, which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think it was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to save the world, we also want, together with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique objects, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group with other performers also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled "End of the World Cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno").
It is already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it also at these charity concerts?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world doesn't happen...
It will be sung simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The hymns will also meet at some point on a very unique live Czech television show.
The lyrics of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main role of Jesus in the video, Xindl X also sings there...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other Czech show-biz personalities, due to the fact that we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We are working to involve them intensively in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it amuses them.
What will be the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training centre which is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we have been working on in the framework of the Jedlička institute, with the association Tap, and this for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkřv Institute and offer them activities that interest and entertain them.
The students themselves cannot afford to go to classes, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will there be several music bands and performers on stage at each of these concerts?
By what criteria, did you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, will go on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you also preparing for other "mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the spring of Prague; here too, we will surely prepare a quality programme with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tours?
It's not as bad as it sounds at first.
We have five members in an electric chair whose gear must travel in a hold, of course we also carry a lot of luggage and instruments boxes....
So far everything has gone more or less well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we returned recently, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we have just witnessed in Moscow that in the east all is still in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there it is not yet common for a person to move alone in an electric chair in the centre of the city.
They do not yet consider it obvious to give priority to a person in a wheelchair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there too, an association is being set up to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
How do we still have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're still late for...
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to travel alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere...
It is still not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather at the forefront of progress!
Public respect and access is one thing, but the situation will really start to change when we have famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
For the moment, they are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, let's go back a few years, what prompted you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I found myself surrounded by many young people willing to invest in something.
And since I myself am a musician (I play, among other things, the saxophone), with a colleague, we have created a music activity.
And then, over time, as our moderator Láā a Angelovič says, we lost a little control of the situation (laughs).
Success has only happened in the last few years, if I'm not mistaken?
It's true, building relationships with known singers and actively working to promote the group has helped us.
We understood that if a job is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the background.
Thanks to subsidies from the European Union, we can also afford to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of stuff that copy each other.
In a way, it makes sense: everything new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pity, it's natural...
But pity is totally useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, whom we must take in pity.
They are people who can live a life in their own right and flourish, provided they have the necessary means, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities achieve something, it is not just a step forward for them but for the whole of society.
Is not your success also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be intransigent in many areas and demand some discipline.
But I think that's perfectly normal.
Some people arrive at us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize they have to come to rehearsals twice a week, take the preparatory classes and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group that wants to work and achieve goals.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
Only one, Láā a Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and go, we can't help it.
Our doors are always open to those who want or would like to join us.
This will be the case the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012, from 9 p.m.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audio-visual relay when the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World Cancelled" will be sung jointly.
The aim of the concert is to bring together financial resources (CZK 25 million) to equip the multi-functional training centre Studeo located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, admission is free for children up to 12 years old, pre-sale tickets are open in Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency countries, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the Agency, the second member of the former Eastern bloc (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had begun close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and in the following years participated in a number of Agency projects.
However, the road from Poland to space started much earlier.
Already before World War II, passionate Poles were working on space flights; they did not always meet with understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on 6 December 1933, at which he presented ideas from his avant-garde book "Introduction to Astronautics."
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his work "Introduction to Astronautics."
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great propagator of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books devoted to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters on the hidden side of the Moon.
As early as 1925, a driveway was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the rocket was to be used to propel or brake the draisin.
The only known information about this raisin is from the press of the time.
From 1933, Polish artillery began to devote itself to rockets.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
It is apparent from the records that this research has reached the trial stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, research has stopped.
In 1937, plans for a photoelectric rocket, designed by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year the book "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were aimed at the military use of rocket engines.
Just before the war, all projects using rocket technology were carried out by the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee had been established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other works on aeronautics were published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, a company is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of Problem, which contains four more detailed articles on aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) made efforts to join the International Astronautical Federation (created in 1951), and by the autumn PTA became a regular member.
The following year, the first President of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in office until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA made a significant contribution to the successful development of the Rakieta Meteorologiczna (RM) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish rocket to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This 1800-metre-wide rocket was 80 cm long and weighed just under 5 kg.
An improved version, RM-1A, was subsequently built and, in the summer of 1959, flight tests of the two-stage RM-2 rocket were initiated in the Bledov Desert.
This rocket was 1.4 metres long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The next prototype should have been able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should have had a range of up to 14.5 km and be used to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket developed during the period 1962-1965, succeeded the first RM rockets.
This rocket, designed with two stages, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed and distinguished by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space with a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B the volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C was 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of craft was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 rockets were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of approximately 60 km.
The Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were later built.
Mention should also be made of Poland's entry into COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos programme, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978 the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of the programme.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court repealed the Public Works Act.
This decision gave rise to considerable public discussion.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalisation, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This means, in practical terms, that the various economic entities and national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of free trade and free movement (without limits) of private capital combined with unbridled financial speculation.
The considerable differences in labour prices (wages) create pressure on prices.
This means that a producer is trying by importing goods sold at low prices to resist economic competition by 'making the competitor's price more expensive', with the aim of removing a larger share of the market and thus increasing its own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transferring production abroad, buying at low prices or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since private capital has no responsibility from the social point of view and thus from the point of view of responsibility for the unemployment it generates, the State's social security contributions necessarily increase.
All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of the entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus to compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole of society by this race for profit.
This situation is so widely known that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create a situation in the various economies in which the governments of the different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own populations in order to attract foreign capital.
In other words, governments put their own people at the mercy of private capital without taking social collapse into account.
This is reflected mainly in the amendments to existing laws.
The aim is to force its own population economically to accept the diktat of private capital prices, particularly in the field of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, by a system of economic constraints in the event of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by the restriction of employees' rights in the field of labour legislation.
This leads to increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, there have been public food distribution points for years for the poor who cannot support themselves with their own work.
The number of such persons is already counted in millions.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, it is becoming quite common for employees to receive such wages that the State is obliged to pay a supplement so that they reach the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal has been brought to light, for example, in the case of employees working as auxiliaries in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern EU Member States undoubtedly generate a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as was the case in the 19th century) or to live with destitute wages, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day private capital invested in their country.
The question here is: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; this capital may not come either, or a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or an African will continue to work for a fraction of a European salary.
This also applies to Latin America as a whole.
Liberal theory and the media claim, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the controlled economy leads to an economic disaster.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot intervene in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then ask ourselves whether private capital does not influence and, even today, does not, according to its own selfish interests, govern politics and, by the same token, the entire State.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is an almost all-powerful lobby present in all States.
This results in a desperate situation in the area of corruption, in the granting of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is reprehensible but not punishable.
In the Federal Republic of Germany, the situation is such that because of the lack of financial resources, national ministries delegate the development of draft laws to law firms closely linked to industry.
These bills are then adopted by the Bundestag.
The entire power comes not from the people, as Western constitutions say, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is clear that liberalism-oriented democracies are now quickly confronted with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled "The Crisis of the Roman Empire at the time of Caesar and Pompey": "The State was long in collapse and the functions were attributed by violence.
Bribes, favors obtained illegally, and stones and swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The underside and corruption proliferated without limits and the people went to the elections with voices already sold... "..." Honest people did not seek any functions, it resulted once the state remained without consuls for 8 months... "'It really began to say that the remedy to this difficult situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." It was true that Appianos had in mind Pompey, but it was Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in antiquity, the present society is based on the preference of personal profit, without regard for the interest of society as a whole.
In essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and assert the interests of society as a whole.
This results, as in the past, in an unprecedented decline of elites, without any effort to carry out far-reaching reforms.
We must therefore seek the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the unscrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things stand, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal democracies can be seen as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that today's elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human casualties, the humanitarian and social crises we witness today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least in the long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is indeed systemic.
The solution consists of socio-political reforms that will strengthen the investment of State capital in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"Nothing will ever come out of violence and never will," says Sting in the song "Fragile, whose main verse of the chorus is" let's not forget how fragile we are. "
"If my sons didn't want wars, there wouldn't be wars," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have arisen.
Some sides Israel, arguing for its right to self-defence and placing Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, citing the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Arabs of Palestine and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I do not want to reflect on the question of who is guilty and who is the victim, in its waves of recurrent killings; all in all, the present inhabitants of Israel, including those of the autonomous territories, were born in the present political situation and did not experience the beginning of the violence.
I would like to offer readers a perspective "behind the curtain," on the one that mainly benefits from the tensions that have already lasted for more than 95 years (starting with the Balfour Declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are based on historical facts available to the study, others come from my own understanding of the one, or more precisely the group of individuals, which is the main instigator of events in modern history.
The history of humanity is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At each time, we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owed their actions to someone who directed their actions according to previously defined objectives.
We must admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers could not be achieved in a single generation.
Among the families with an astronomical richness is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the octopus (I do not know if these families still have a leader but I do not exclude it).
Little is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s, they acquired the world's first news agency (Reuters) to end the links between their names and serious criminal acts that they were involved in and that had always meant to them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their wealth or both.
They have major holdings in almost most of the world's central banks and are preparing or waging wars against countries in which they do not yet have such holdings (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only 4, in the meantime Russia has placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who tried to stand up against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the central bank status of the Rothschild Bank of America and began to issue his own money (government, I hear) during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the EDF, he was murdered in 1963, MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to start a lawsuit against the EDF for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a freemason initiated at the 33rd degree, being the highest level.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great state monarchies of Europe, the second was to abolish colonialism, particularly in the United Kingdom, and the third was to reduce the world's population from 1 to 0.5 billion people (such a quantity of slaves was sufficient for their luxury and comfort), create a single universal religion (ecumenism being nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and ultimately acquire absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with the Rothschild at their head is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the EDF to prevent repeated crises such as those which they provoked in 1907).
After having succeeded in triggering the first world war by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The first world war abruptly ended with German capitulation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of tsarist Russia) and was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For an easier outbreak of the Second World War, the bankers let the politicians create a situation of latent conflict: on the one hand, they imposed onerous war reparations on Germany, thus creating the conditions for radicalization of the impoverished masses (it is then enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, pointing to the culprits, proposing simple solutions) and, on the other hand, they created a Czechoslovakia composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority, which had to play the role (which it actually held) of the fifth column to set fire to the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of whose branches aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the foundations for a massive emigration of Jews to Palestine and the first friction with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist acts were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke the chains in which the international bankers had initially held him; or if all he had done was planned, the fact is, however, that the sufferings of the Jews of Europe in the concentration camps created the basis for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; just as the war reparations imposed on Germany were at the origin of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel ignited a fire fire that could provoke a Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the fighting, this time as well as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but at the international level (just see how people are sharply divided between supporters and defenders of Israel).
Who is guilty and who is the victim of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where harm causes another harm in an endless cycle of violence and where the greed of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the world is at the root of everything?
Here we have to make the difference between the ordinary citizens of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only offer their own candidates to the people in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who is doing everything possible to launch a war with Iran, which, because of its accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) could expand to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Strait of Ormuz through which 20% of all the world's oil flows (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light does David Rockefeller's comments in 1994 now appear: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a handful of aristocrats of finance is served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is implanted at birth with an electronic chip that makes him a totally controlled being.
"Let them compel all individuals, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to bear on their hands or foreheads a mark with red iron, so that they may neither buy nor sell anyone who does not bear the name of this ferocious beast or the number of his name.
One must understand: that whoever has common sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number designates the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The film Argo: when everything goes wrong, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of demonstrators composed of Islamist students stormed the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which had supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the US administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the confidence of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to liberate the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algerian government.
Their fate sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment in the United States.
The Iranian debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by actor and director Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that gave America a small victory.
Just before she was busy, six employees escaped from the embassy.
After complicated adventures, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran thanks to a rocambolesque cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a film crew who came to make sightings for the shooting of a science-fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez called for Hollywood's collaboration.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized magazines reported on this film project, press conferences were held and a fictitious production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained for a long time secret, the film being based on Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is an unusual combination of several genres.
It is, on the one hand, a politically conceived thriller, but also a "caper movie," the story of a successful blow, of a treachery - such as, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres follow each other: documentary-style Teheran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the epoch of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations have been transcribed in the film, there are no great differences),
lighter passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
and then scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions with costumed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and on the phone...
Ben Affleck managed to restart his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director and his acting stopped arousing ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the dark cop "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and thriller "The town" (2010).
It is also the first film by Affleck that does not take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates this sense of atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran "is held" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity, which also suggests confusion and unpredictability when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect in fictitious scenes (the false shooting team in Tehran's bazaar).
Too many actions in too many places
The director had to confine himself to a subject that actually offered few exciting scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
He does very well, he sometimes adds some elements to the reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the threat of crisis at Tehran airport is ruled out by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the airstrip is quite drawn by the hair).
Argo's weakness lies in his dissipated character, due to the need to show too many events in too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role as Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have earned a bigger place and they are not, far from it, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it is seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the retro style and realization of the 70s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a history still, in a way, unfinished to date, and as an illustration of the exaggeration of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the business.
Rules to inflate balloons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual public inquiry into the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to launch the competition for the regulation or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop."
"The fact that the EU is planning to adopt a quota of 40 per cent of women for the management of large European companies in recent times has been at the origin of our decision," said the newspaper Právo, the organiser of this survey, Patrik Nacher.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is already, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, however, women have had an advantage in terms of life insurance rates because they represent, objectively, a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can point out until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop."
"The vote will take place before the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuels, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance, or the directive on the size of chicken cages, which has led to an increase in the price of eggs.
There has also been criticism in the past of the de facto ban on the use of the term "butter to spread" or the withdrawal of the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Quality bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under pressure from a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a state or group of states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently imposing requests from its banks by threatening to use its veto power).
The interests of pressure groups are also at the root, for example, of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be less than 14 cm in size or have an "abnormal curvature."
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it was merely harmonising non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruit and vegetables have been relaxed despite opposition from some States, claiming that the existing directives waste food.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to last year's EU regulation which requires inflatable balloons to give a warning that children under 8 years of age must not inflate without adult supervision.
The EU has referred to an American survey according to which balloons are among the leading causes of child suffocation deaths among toys.
A similar restriction applies to children under 14 years of age when blowing in fair trumpets.
At home too, we have some weird ideas.
The following rule concerning European civil servants themselves is rather absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, anyone with an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonia" and should instead speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the "Let's Do" association of liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky.com server named in this investigation, in addition to some of the above-mentioned absurdities, the EU regulation concerning the volume of food reserves in the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volumes set for canned mushrooms and was thus liable to a heavy fine.
The organizers of this survey found it interesting to pay money to some countries because they do not have access to the sea and to grant a grant to apply for grants.
However, these ideas do not originate in Brussels but in Prague.
"The fact that we don't have a sea makes us handicapped.
We will ask the European Union for a refund. "Thus, in the autumn of 2004, the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) said.
He argued that, as a result of our wheat production, and as a result of so-called "interventionist" purchases, the State had found itself with full stocks and had then had to export them.
According to Palas, the EU should have paid us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
In the end, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech request and organised a call for tenders for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Grants for grants were offered to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), which was intended, in practice, to be used to prepare applications for grants granted by Brussels.
The EU states: "Weird regulations are rare."
While the regulations are often criticized in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the Union's operation and its overall development deserve praise.
More serious, for example, according to experts, is the problem of using EU grants for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with strengthening European integration, but which were imposed by the Member States during the budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (a struggle from which it does not always win) gives rise to strong emotions among the Czech people.
If, after six years of fighting against the Germans and Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the name "Olomoucké tvarÿžky," for the name "Tuzemský rum" which dates back to our home in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the name "Tuzemák."
Only cane sugar alcohol products, not beet sugar products, may bear the name rum.
In the official list of registered EU products, there are today in the company of internationally known cheeses such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the Lübeck massepin or Parma ham, the Karlovy Vary biscuits ("Karlovarské suchary"), the Pohořelice and Třebo carp ("Pohořelický a Třebořský kapr") and the Žatec hops ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice's gingerbread ("Pardubický perník") and the cakes called "Hořice's cornets" ("hořické trubičky") may also be proud of their Community trade mark.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, says Senator Okamura
Senator, how do we get the idea of running for president?
It's not being a senator or a president that matters to me.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I wouldn't be running anywhere.
But I can no longer stand to see how looted the country has been for the last twenty years, that thieves are not under lock-up and taxes and retirement age are increasing.
I didn't have the ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, then I try to come up with a solution for it to change.
And since I am more than forty years old and an independent member of any party, I have no other way of influencing the situation than to run for president or senatorial office.
You entered the Senate but quickly set off for the Castle (N.d.T.: seat of the presidency).
Don't you turn your back on those who elected you?
I've always said that I will go into battle for the Castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
Subsequently, I made it clear that if I were elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not function, it is only an instrument for me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we are crying at the bar or in front of our television station, but that we are also trampling on those who are trying to bring about change.
In addition, the press breaks people's reputation and confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I have been told that I have been a welter to journalists or that I have been an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's get to your visions.
You have begun the struggle for the Castle with as battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax declarations beyond twenty million [of CZK].
To that end, you must change the law.
As President, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When, as a citizen, I lobbied for tourism guides to be a liberal profession, I was successful.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from the left or the right with a good project, it is knowingly refused and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I am much more likely to get the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of being able, without categorization and dogma, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you think of yourself as a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I feel like people are putting me to the left instead.
For me, whether it's a little left or a little right, it's not really important.
For me, the important thing is that we move forward.
What matters to me is not whether people are left or right, but to bring people together.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Do you enrage when someone says you're a populist?
But what you said doesn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal purpose and vision.
You're trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I'm talking about have been put into practice by the world and recognized experts have spoken about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only slogans left.
You won't survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and public opinion and try to rally them to my camp in order to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal liability of politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
They should then perhaps explain why they do not want it.
When there is a strong personality that identifies abuses, it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the election of the president by direct suffrage, which was obtained through public pressure.
I admit, without a doubt, that I am an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I have just entered politics and I am trying to get majority support for my program.
I'm alone trying to move things forward, and if it doesn't work, I'll stop in six years and go back to the private sector.
It's kind of like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that only one person can make the difference, which is why I went to a number of personalities to ask them to run for senatorial office as well.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
At least I supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the oil fraud.
I introduced myself because people are really unhappy but now I hesitate.
Sixty per cent of the people did not vote and what did did, for the most part, gave their voice to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate, we are only two independents.
People have elected a Senate that will hardly be able to impose changes.
In spite of everything, I will fight for my vision, for example the direct election of mayors and prefects of regions.
Are you considering founding your own party?
No, not yet, because I don't have time to check whether every potential member's past is spotless and then I don't have the financial means.
I don't have money for my presidential campaign either, I only have twenty thousand on my "transparent" account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about tax returns, what's yours?
I estimate the value of my personal property to be about 60 million.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth 10 million, another apartment worth 8 million, a collection of works of art worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and an Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million in my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a kid's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving, was gallant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You drive in Aston Martin, you have a $60 million heritage and you don't have any money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest your own money in it?
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program does not attract much interest.
I don't have to pay for this campaign out of my pocket.
My campaign expenses are generally covered by the remuneration that I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn't live with it, for example, paying my son's English school, which costs 30 grand a month.
If my only goal was to earn money, I won't run for any election.
So you're going to continue your business activities so you can live?
Didn't you say you were going to turn your activities off?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I have partially curtailed my activities.
For example, my deputy will take over the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live on something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I was winning and I keep winning between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would put an end to my business.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper Práva.
The architects of the firm MVRVV prove that true adventures are not just about imagination. To convince yourself, just contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected mountain of books - 2 photos
"I think this building is fun, it is very futuristic, at last something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large nearby company, tells us: "Yes, it is indeed beautiful, this building."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has the Internet, an iPad and e-books.
Today, no one goes voluntarily to one of those dorky libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, has a rather special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls has the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to give back a few neurons to the brains, the city decided a few years ago to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of pretty little miniatures of painted reinforced concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive has remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to regain control of statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, from the architectural office of Rotterdam MVRDV, master of daring stick diagrams and creator of often cynical and witty buildings, accepted the project with its usual phlegm and competed in 2003 with five books under his arm and a chuckle on his face.
And while the members of the jury were still looking at each other, disconcerting and shrugging their shoulders, Maas, the unbridled, encroached on his books of choice in order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech, supported by activist arguments, with one: "dear common!"
Here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Mountain of Books, or as they say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain was thrown out of the ground.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and houses for a total of 50 dwellings.
In early November, the mountain of books received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
Thus, this dull little town, which until now had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a town hall of staggering ugliness, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now owns the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Path to Reading
First impression: Eldorado from the book under a cheese bell.
Certainly, an elevator takes you to the heart of the massif, but the true joys of reading and architecture open up to you when you cross the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The interior made entirely of glass is bright and clear, the floor made of Dutch bricks and elegant verbales speak unequivocally the language of municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We're already looking at public benches, dogs, and little boys and girls playing ball.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Normally, the library shelves are located along the façade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal," explains Willy Maas.
We completely disrupted the classical spatial configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the mountain of books has been skilfully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the centre for the environment and the technical center of the building.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes panelling, sometimes balustrades, sometimes stair ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader at the town of Spijkenisse, in a response to the Standard.
So one day we found an ad hoc waste from agriculture in a Frisian farm.
In the Netherlands, one millimetre thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrate in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and we're saving time.
The thin membrane is used for one or two seasons, and can be discarded.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such quantities, into plates of a thickness of four centimetres.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes colour and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resistant material, the smell of which evokes both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 steps is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary café offers us an amazing view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and jars.
The latter create an atmosphere, but above all they contribute to maintaining the ideal level of moisture in the air of the literary mountain.
Gifts for the new soul
"It's amazing, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model ecological project," says Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is controlled by geothermal.
Although the mountain of books is below a glass bell, the sun only illuminates the interior for a short time, even on days of good weather.
The thick wooden beams mounted across from the glass façade serve as a sun shield, intercepting much of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The completely automated blinds take care of the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already risked entering the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already here.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of traditional Chinese medicine, even describes the Boekenberg as Spijkenisse's "finally recovered soul."
A few weeks ago, at the inauguration, every citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This has made it possible to fill the gaps in the library, which has not yet been completely filled (today, it has 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing everywhere.
For architect Winy Maas, "there's nothing worse than a half-empty library."
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between every citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's only for decoration. "
In this way, MVRDV has achieved the master discipline which is called, in professional jargon, "the creation of an identity."
Spijkenisse wrote a new literary history page.
Even if she may seem young and uneducated.
Finally, it is a new starting point for the creation of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany chose abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-EU relations, this decision puts Berlin in a difficult political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany announced its intention to vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then she chose abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve of what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious, as it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think that it does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to assert its independence, but it did not want to be too critical of Israel.
At the March 2011 Libyan uprising, Germany had also chosen abstention in the vote on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is in the process of reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to move away from a policy, so to speak, defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Moreover, the lack of a coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans therefore faced several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that they are still trying to find this role, but are on the way to a "more normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy, as in France or Great Britain
What does the term "normal" foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the will to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national issues.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of the other major powers: that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany's position vis-à-vis the Middle East conflict and abstention in the UN vote?
Germany first has important markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
That is why Berlin must be careful not to hit public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive factor.
However, I would not attach too much importance to this, because it is not an exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in German strategic thinking.
Does Germany undermine its relations with the United States by choosing abstention in important votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I believe that the Europeans and Americans fully understand the German position.
That is why I believe that the fracture is not so serious as it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Perhaps even Germany will be respected.
Germany has thus demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, opinions on the Palestinian initiative are diverse.
On the other hand, the United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Do the views differ between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences because of the American domestic political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration is secretly demonstrating a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from overflowing with enthusiasm for Netanyahu's policy.
Does Germany find it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the major European partners, on the other?
I don't think that makes it easy for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little simpler for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, but today that is not the case.
They cannot therefore form part of a wider political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are doing now on the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will play a role as a locomotive in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been a delicate one.
But in my view, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that is more important to their independence.
Is Germany playing a leading role on the international stage, and does Germany only want to play a key role?
Or does it still have difficulty in taking on leadership roles?
Germany is still not used to it, it is still uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still has difficulties in playing a more important role.
Looking, for example, at the euro crisis, we see that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German sentiments are heard.
It doesn't make things any easier for the Germans.
In fact, it is always the same problem: we do not want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It has to deal with very diverse neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
Today the influence of the United States on European policy is only diminishing, but at the moment the EU is not filling this void, so who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a more important role.
And even if they don't like it, even if it's unpleasant to them and they're less appreciated, it's life!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are well-known brands around the world.
Armani Polo... what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but it has nothing to do with the original company.
The trade mark thus enjoys such protection that the undertaking bearing the name of the trade mark cannot lodge a complaint.
And even if she could, he's not sure she would win the case.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China," explains Thomas Pattloch, lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in infringing property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new file arrives on my desk.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to register their trademarks.
For example, instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports goods.
Pattloch opens a binder containing the registrations made at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company filed the trademark Zegna DF Puma, a name that the firm artificially created by appropriating part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become champions of the world of copying and infringement of intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multi-storey shopping malls that sell virtually only counterfeit goods.
However, Pattloch's cases are different: its constituents charge it with addressing the fact that the Chinese Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese are talking about "Bang Mingpai," a parent brand.
The term is derived from "Bang Dakuan."
This is the term used to refer to women who marry rich men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame themselves for.
"It's bad for business, we have to fight this trend," says Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the singularity disappears, the damage to reputation is enormous."
Financial losses and legal costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third fastest growing and third fastest growing world market for luxury products.
However, it is not easy to remove suspicious registrations from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
The latter can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch refers to the trials in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period of time, the name criticized had become a "market reality."
Pattloch explains that if the complainant is not lucky, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, as he would have harmed his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the jungle that dominates.
Famous cases also concern graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine manufacturer Sany, the same company that had just bought the concrete pump producer Putzmeister.
That's why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo's acquisitor, used a blue and white logo before that of BMW. The conflict was settled and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste fashion house had lost to the plagiarists of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the gaze of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not guilty of anything.
However, the CTMO trademark office in Beijing admitted to having experienced some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the Office would have moved last year from "an emergency situation in the course of the work to a normality that had been restored."
Thus, the number of unprocessed opposition proceedings would have decreased by 22%.
Almost 57,000 such cases were reported to have been closed, an increase of 75 per cent over the previous year.
Nevertheless, 81,500 proceedings remain pending at the Office.
Taking action is expensive
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the Office, this is a record and this means that China is the tenth consecutive top of the list for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal marks, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the Office reportedly accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration fees.
In other words, each record earned an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as the case of the German family company Freudenberg illustrates.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
Of course, the Germans were able to get the illegal manufacture of vehicle components to be suspended.
However, the imitator was able to maintain its Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"This is our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany," explains Hanno Wentzler, President of the management of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The trademark office had therefore rejected the Munichois' objection.
While Freudenberg has won the case in the following two instances, the opposing side continues to fight until today.
Vigilance is necessary
Today, the case is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, believes in a positive outcome of the trial and praises the professionalism of the judges.
Nevertheless, he adds: "The procedure is long, difficult and costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The archives department has even had to review the actions of the last hundred years in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed to the opposing party in vain a "large six-digit euro sum" to settle the dispute.
"This is where we see what it means to us," Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to overflow Europe.
This would be the case if imitators from this region were to secure the exploitation of unprotected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to deposit the name Freudenberg for a shoe and leather production company in Germany.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but could still have prevented the deposit.
Wentzler adds: "Vigilance is the right thing to do."
Pattloch and advised German companies to exercise great caution in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, in their view, to rely on international trademark law; rather, foreigners should "register in China all that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, costs can be much higher than registration costs.
If Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company would have to pay license fees to the opposing party for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or we would lose our place in the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: typing, singing, helping
The Imbongi choir repeats in Heidelberg, and the AIDS orphans of Swaziland rejoice in their coming.
This is the story of a link that crosses far more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, you kick your foot: cowboy boots, sneakers, ladies' shoes and men's moccasins look for the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot. Very soon, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the singers slowly amplify - viola, bass, tenor and soprano - they win, envy and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor almost lost his canvas shoes when he directed the orchestra with his wild flexibility.
Today, Monday evening, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers from 23 to 69 years of age came, from geneticist in human medicine to man at home.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy song, each singer has different lyrics, all in a very exotic language: Zulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Being helped to help one another
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by the disease.
Of these, 23.5 million live in southern Africa.
Swaziland has 245,000 infected persons.
In addition, more than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans from the village of Esitjeni have found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa."
70 of them attend a secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros less, you can become a sponsor.
This money guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo centre.
Imbongi means in zulu "storyteller" or "praise singer."
No one can speak the Bantu language fluently in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For almost 10 years, the choir has been rehearsing songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany to return it to its native region: the South of Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometres flying from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
40% of people affected
The village has about 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of straw or land, and the majority of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV has taken their parents away.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the evils that afflict Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
The population almost never accepts male circumcision, a measure which, however, guarantees a proven reduction in the risk of infection by half.
More than 40 per cent of Swaziland's population is infected with the virus and it is not uncommon to die in the mid-30s.
On a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mainly saw many children on the street who lacked not only parental care, but also everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school diploma, there is simply no prospect.
At first, they were only a few people who personally agreed to pay a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal a day.
But just a year later, the choir founded "Voices for Africa," an association that since then has been working almost professionally with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common STIs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Pubic lice and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
Which groups are primarily concerned?
Syphilis and gonorrhea often occur in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that sexual contact between men is responsible for at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, infections related to chlamydia, trichomonase, candidiasis (fungal), blennorrhagia and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV transmission between heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, some 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
Among young people, there is a significantly higher rate of chlamydia-related infections than among other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections concern young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, in Germany, the human papilloma virus is common among young people.
What is the trend in the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years, from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has been decreasing.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This represents a decrease of one tenth over the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genitals, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower stomach, and the appearance of buttons and warts.
However, they do not cause any regular pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How can we protect ourselves?
Condoms may reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
This is because sexually transmitted disease pathogens can also be transmitted through lubricating infection or close body contact.
The experts therefore recommend that any person who frequently changes sexual partners should take regular examinations.
Most of the rapidly detected STIs can be cured and delayed sequelae can be avoided.
Thanks to sponsorships, donations, but above all to the funds that the chorists raise thanks to their voices throughout Germany, the means accumulate.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-confident woman who always gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphans are well housed, such as in one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, which are called the old women in Zulu, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them receive up to 14 orphans, offer them a roof and ensure that they go to school on an hourly basis in their uniforms.
The orphan who has no one is welcomed to a safe place at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as are the two cooks who prepare meals daily for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a sewing school and allowed the construction of two collars. With the help of the American health organization PSI, the association organized an HIV test for many inhabitants.
This is not self-evident, because although the disease is clearly visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A king and his 14 wives
"AIDS is a real taboo," explains Annette Lennartz, "because it is a subject that affects sexuality."
It's quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch in black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These state-sanctioned customs, among others, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus throughout the country.
However, condoms are found at every corner of the street, "says Annette Lennartz," but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh. "
In order to encourage some cultural exchange, Imbongi's chorists travel together every two or three years in southern Africa and sing songs filled with nostalgia, courage, trust and black identity that many people on the tip of the black continent still experience in the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with whites singing in African language is a sign of recognition that not only does good mood and joy, but also sometimes tears out a few fearsome border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their godchildren.
Although it is difficult to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni valley.
"Go to Esitjeni, you will find light there," people say there.
And after a bird flight of 8,733 kilometers, back to Heidelberg, in front of those chorists who hit their feet in the rehearsal room of the Bergheimer Straße, we also find the light.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe reported evidence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could be as thick as 20 metres.
The US Space Agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explained by three studies published this Thursday in the specialized journal "Science."
The Messenger probe reported evidence of the existence of an ice cover in the region of the planet constantly dipping into the shade.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimetres up to 20 metres.
The water probably comes from comets or maybe asteroids that hit Mercury.
However, nobody links the discovery of water to the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other life-saving elements arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, probes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstices through which one observes infinity.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a "planet," according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of the countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are in blue and the pink dots, more difficult to identify, are the "newborns" in the universe's delivery room.
The Spitzer telescope discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5," a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, at 6,500 light-years.
NASA's Spitzer telescope photographed the flamboyant glow of a dying star.
The doughnut-shaped circle is composed of elements that the star projects when it dies.
In the immense Trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades, a cluster of stars also called "the seven sisters," can be observed with the naked eye at night.
However, the telescope puts more emphasis on colours.
In this infrared photo, Helice's nebula, like a red eye, looks directly at the viewer.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
His resemblances to a land continent earned him the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and the infrared photo makes it possible to observe a spectacular tint.
Only the infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest riddles of astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving any trace.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
Depending on the tint, photographs of spiral galaxies can become real works of art
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the nebula of the Trifid in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light years away.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three trails of dust divide the shining heart of the birthplace of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the beginnings of a cosmic carambolage in the Serpentine constellation: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two melting galaxies rushed towards each other, the collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, you can use its nickname "Southern Fire Wheel."
The photo of the Hubble space telescope shows a detail of the Iris nebula in the constellation of Cephea.
The nebula is 1,400 light-years away and consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than the usual household dust.
This photo was developed from optical and radiographic photographs taken by various telescopes.
You can see the circle of black holes that is 430 million light-years away from the Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810."
In this nebula you will find the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The celestial cradle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette nebula, also create young stars constantly 5,000 light years away from the Earth.
In this light-ray galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, there is only gas.
Scientists think he was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our gaze on the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was allegedly invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have continued to grow, and thanks to them, it has been possible to see ever further in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Mountain Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows to observe the universe through two mirrors each having a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The belly of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canary Islands, is huge. The mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The Southern African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa has been segmented to save money.
The diameter still reaches about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the vertical angle.
Its particularity is due to its large light collection capacity.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is similar to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of alien signals using the radio telescope of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Any person who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) by making use of the computing power of his machine.
View of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("very large telescope"), a fitting worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the average infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach an impressive size of 42 metres. It will consist of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take pictures until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, Keck's two telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors with a diameter of 10 metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observatory, which observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A new giant telescope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows us to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mostly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidate planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space at the earliest in 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The mission of the telescope will be to find light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the South Pole of Mercury also houses ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this theory, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data for decades indicated the presence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbite around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty.
Drink butter daily, and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach ages worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A survey of a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97.
The trip to the Talysh Mountains is a romantic one.
At the turn of many turns of the road, the small cahote bus along wooded hills, torrential rivers and modest farms.
It's all green and fertile, it's almost like the Black Forest.
But here we are in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group called Talysh lives, about which little is known, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azeri and have a very long life.
Terminus: Lerik.
The small town is plastered with its too aggressive architecture of the Soviet era which does not match at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is far too painful.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometres, because the road has only one lane.
The province has not yet benefited from the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
"Baku became famous in May thanks to the help of Eurovision, and next year there will be the festival of the oldest people in the world," explains Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, the only museum of its kind in the world.
You can discover the lives of about eight dozen Talysh of the region, who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
Having another child at age 136
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Müslümov, a shepherd who would have turned 168.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And when we think that the oldest documented person was 122 years old, the age of Müslümov seems more than doubtful.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," says Fatulayeva.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he would have conceived another girl.
Şirali Müslümov would he have been wrong for a few decades in calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard of the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"Surprisingly elderly people also live in parts of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old."
However, scientific evidence cannot be established due to the lack of documentation, and there was no civil registry.
Every day, a glass of melted butter
However, people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the patriarchs of the Bible.
Currently, 20 people are over 100 years of age.
So what is the reason for the longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have particular genes.
On the other hand, Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, thinks it's a food issue.
However, it does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view that Talysh's calorie-rich meals, which like meat, bread and especially dairy products and many drink a glass of melted butter daily, are healthy.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves people's youth? In Cengemiran, a tiny village near the town of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
With her 97 years of age, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She sits on the ground next to a baratto, whose contents she beats tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two little kids are also gambadin 'in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical belly-shaped armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her scarf are long braids of a dark blond that her son proudly reveals to us.
I've always washed my hair with milk, and that's how I never lost them and they kept their color.
"I've never used shampoo," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly retirement is enough to live
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
In my whole life, I've never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything improved when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over.
The language of propaganda astonishes in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who has ruled his country like a dictator, knows almost no limits in Azerbaijan
He was in power until 2003, and his son Ilham subsequently succeeded him.
In any case, the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know the distress.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats per month (approximately the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good lifestyle in the region.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-standing grizzly son is right: "Elders enjoy great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared for and happy.
That's a good reason to live as long as possible.
"Human rights" omitted from the Constitution
The revolution was revived in Cairo.
Opposite demonstrations reveal the deep divide of the country.
The draft constitution based on the sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not greedy with words full of emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on state television.
His speech was intended for the entire people, but also especially for the Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and lay people.
Because all members of the opposition are confused and desperately disunited.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said, almost apologizing, that he had temporarily restricted the powers of the Constitutional Court and extended his powers "in order to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world do not really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overthrown?
The 234 articles written hastily by the majority Islamic Constituent Assembly of 100 people during a 15-hour night tour are indeed worrying to some extent.
As in previous constitutions, the draft provides that case law is based on "the principles of Islamic law."
But what does the word "principles" really mean?
It was and still remains a matter of interpretation, and there is good reason to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the resulting legal room for manoeuvre to apply a stricter interpretation of sharia law.
In any case, it is suggested that a newly introduced article stipulates that, with regard to all matters relating to Sharia, al-Azhar University should be consulted. The institution is the most important Islamic institution in the country and its brilliance radiates on the whole Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto lead to the guardianship of the judiciary.
Many points of the draft Constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely retention of military jurisdiction.
During the reign of Mubarak, these courts tried to repress opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained by the military.
The bill also states that the State must protect "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values."
From a legal point of view, the wording is so vague that state institutions could even control the content of cinematographic art and literature.
In other words, it would simply be censorship.
Moreover, there is no specific article guaranteeing equality between men and women.
Instead, another article forbids to offend or defame the Prophet Muhammad or his envoys.
On the other hand, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Equally doubtful is the wording suggesting that it is prohibited to "offend persons."
Is it enough to draw a cartoon of the president or to tell a joke to the detriment of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft which Morsi is putting to the vote and which, in his own words, will be the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians "very soon."
"The revolution was reborn"
The opposition has been campaigning for weeks against the numerical superiority of Islamists.
Friday night, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in unusual harmony in Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring down the sharia before it enters into force.
"The revolution is coming back and we are going to win," says Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei stated that the draft Constitution is "to be thrown into the garbage of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi's supporters of wanting to foment a "putsch against democracy."
"If he proclaims the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," exclaimed Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet atoned," said the Egyptian media Khaled Ali, a politician and member of the opposition.
In addition, several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-demonstration not on Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other side of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of Cairo University.
The veiled women and supporters of the Salafists, who participated in large numbers, chanted: "The people demand the application of the law of God."
"Clean up our country!" they asked Morsi, saying that "the Qur'an was their Constitution."
A fight for sovereignty over the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have given rise to a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Obviously, that's what Morsi's supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood stated that the opponents of the draft Constitution, like its supporters, had spoken loud and clear.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the ballot boxes what direction the country should take.
The Islamist project will certainly win the majority.
"Human rights are not mentioned once"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry at this imposed constitutional process, which should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
He did so not because he shared their view of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That's why he was beaten, tried and imprisoned.
"And now the term is not even pronounced once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi's powers to all three powers discouraged the lawyer.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead to a new dictatorship in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto takes away all his powers," deplores Saeda.
Yet a democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who watches the battle between the various political ideologies on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid for.
A protester on Tharir Square warns: "you are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
Norway's rakfisk: is it the most fragrant fish in the world?
Norway's five million people enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the success of the country be linked to the appetite of the locals for an extremely fragrant fish?
Take some advanced cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet, dirty soccer clothes.
Wait a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's most popular dishes.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It snows, the landscape is spectacular - and this smell, omnipresent, permeates the air.
The rakfisk consists of trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in water for a duration - depending on the smell you want it to exhale - which can go up to a year.
When the darkness settles and it is cold, the Norwegian gather in mass to attend a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat raw, then swallow a glass of aquavit," explains Havard Halvarsen, a local full-time firefighter who is also called "Rakfisk General," responsible for managing the festival.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and put on a large amount of drink.
"Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk," says Havard.
The drink kills the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it under your nose, it's not bad - it makes you think of a sushi who would have spent long hours on a bus.
The rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of refrigeration, the fish was submerged in air-tight water barrels and then salted in the fall.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish went out and - undoubtedly with the senses weakened by alcohol - ate.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegian people were forced to leave their country to find work, emigrating mainly to the United States.
The population is now growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full employment, high wages and a comprehensive health care system.
The Swedes, their old rivals whose country was not so much richer than Norway, cross the border to work.
The rakfisk is considered to be something important, a vital, though fragrant, element of Norway's past.
It's one of the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small pint of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 €each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to its displeasure.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing extremist racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this killing, they talk about the "July 22 incident."
It is difficult for the Norwegian people to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such an act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway has owed its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason for our success," explains Anna, our waitress, with blonde hair and in the eyes of a piercing blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a platter of rakfisk in her hand.
We are - how do you say - prudent people.
His English, like that of most people who live here, is perfect.
We're discreet, we don't like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution - everything, with the exception of a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for future generations.
When other countries were throwing money out the window, in the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the cords of its stock market tight.
"As long as you can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"Not to mention the rakfisk," she adds in a careless laugh.
I stand under the snow and line up to buy some food - I got my dose of rakfisk.
On the menu, a hamburger made of moose, a real discovery, it's excellent.
But tonight, the smell of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where we serve rakfisk for dinner and where we can vote for the best of them - or perhaps for the most fragrant of them.
There's a TV show where the presenter wears a bow tie, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
It's like the Eurovision contest.
"What score did you give to the best fish in the Thor-Juergen Mountains?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, perhaps because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it's because of the fish fumes.
Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto has a difficult start.
As incoming President Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office in Mexico, BBC's Will Grant is interested in the challenges ahead and the many expectations of the people.
Road traffic in Mexico City is particularly poor at present.
In a city where traffic jams are normal, a safety barrier has been in place since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the aim was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential scarf to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico's economy is doing well, thanks to outgoing President Felipe Calderon, but the country is plagued by a drug war that has already claimed the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to U.S. President Barack Obama in the Ovale Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before joining the American President, Mr. Pena Nieto was Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populous and sprawling state that encloses the capital. On its favourite land, opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is inscribed in the memory of all.
The premises attribute to it the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To reach the city, you can take one of the new motorways of Mr Pena Nieto, an important improvement has been made to these roads, once buggy and full of crevasses.
Plates bearing his name are hung outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
"We are counting on him to bring about lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and of the party of Mr Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country needs so much.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejected the criticisms of the opponents who accused the new president of lacking charisma.
He is an entire man, very committed, with an excellent vision of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more blatant.
Hidden under motorways, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was called to the rescue to fight the drug gangs in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a disaster zone, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the past two years have been found on the edge of the landfill.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women killed there.
Critics of Mr Pena Nieto say that at best he failed to contain the problem of murders against women when he was in office.
At worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to face reality.
In a concrete house, typical of this dilapidated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to hold her tears when she shows me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version refers to a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed," says the Señora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and rigidity had already begun.
While her mother tells the story, a picture of Mariana dresses the wall, next to a cross with the word: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family was denied.
The authorities treated me like I was an old gossip, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They want us to accept what they say and keep quiet.
"But it's not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his scarf on Saturday, it will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new President has promised that he will make it his priority during his tenure.
"I hope he will be as good as when he was president," said Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain of ill-treatment, say prosecutors.
The prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of ill-treatment that Bradley Manning was allegedly subjected to during the detention.
The trial concerns Manning's detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to close the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping took place under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors attempted to demonstrate on Friday that Private Bradley Manning -- accused of being responsible for the biggest leak of confidential information in the history of the U.S. Army -- missed numerous opportunities to complain about the ill-treatment he claims to have suffered during his military detention.
During cross-examination with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein stated that recordings of weekly visits to Manning by officers during his nine-month detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints regarding his treatment.
Cross-examination -- at a hearing, the defence filed a motion requiring Manning to be closed on the ground that the kidnapping took place in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place one day after Manning testified that he wanted to commit suicide during his detention.
This military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the hearing on Friday, Fein discussed with Manning the forms that the officers had completed after meeting Manning during his detention in Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein referred to the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment he received from his guards was "excellent" and that the treatment he had received in the prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not mention any complaints of ill-treatment, although the officers directly questioned him about his prison treatment, said Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed concerns about certain problems orally and that visiting officers had discussed his concerns and indicated that they would deal with them, but they did not record the problems raised.
"They wrote" no problem "(after addressing the concerns), but that did not mean that I had not raised any problems," Manning said.
Military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked Manning why he had not complained about his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had met to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention at the meeting was to have his restrictive status changed to indicate a "risk of injury."
The military stated that they had assigned this restrictive status to him -- a level below close surveillance for suicide risk -- for his protection and the safety of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I was fine, and I wanted to be removed from my status... in order to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view," said Manning.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He stated that he had considered suicide while in Kuwait and had fainted once because of the heat.
He added that the fact that he had not been kept informed of what was going to happen to him or what was going on in the rest of the world was very distressing.
"My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon at this cage," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I was gonna die in that cage.
Once in Quantico, Manning stated that he had spent most of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only items at his disposal were a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
He tried to stay in motion because sleeping or lying down during the day was against the rules.
Manning also said that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lit outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up so that they could see his face.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation reported in his testimony on Thursday -- that after being forced to sleep naked all night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other detainees one morning during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time was he allowed to cover himself with cover during the appeal.
During the judge's questions on Friday, Manning stated that he had inferred from his custody's order that he had to drop his cover that might have hidden his nudity, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, as he allegedly tried to prove to an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reportedly told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or flip-flops to hurt himself, but that he had not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his flip-flops, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account his experiences during his detention and that he will significantly reduce his sentence if he is found guilty before a court martial, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
The defense has stated that Manning is considering pleading guilty to the least serious crimes and fighting for the abandonment of other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing should resume this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon confirmed that Manning was incarcerated in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Charges brought against Manning include theft of public property or documents, collusion with the enemy, resulting in illegal publication of information on the Internet, and transmission of information related to national defence.
If all charges are upheld, he is liable to life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame those who left; they remind Mexicans of difficult times, he said.
Navarrette says the Mexico-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, when I arrived in the lobby, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
There were signs indicating two lanes: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans") and another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood still for several seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
This is an ethnic qualifier, just as my friends in Boston use when they call themselves "Irish," or my friends in New York when they call themselves "Italian."
Then I became "Mexico-American."
But here was Mexico.
And on the earth that saw my grandfather born, there is no need for a special qualifier or a trait of union.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle an interview in either language.
But I don't have an Aboriginal vocabulary, and I can't lose my American accent.
So I took my American passport and headed for the "Foreigners" line.
I thought about that moment of the week when new Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their preferred themes are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada, and to create a Union for Trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not provide more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half their territory to the point of the rifle.
But for Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official criticizes Mexico, you begin to hear -- in the Mexican press, and among the elites -- complaints about how Americans violate their neighbour's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for a fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is with the more than 35 million Mexico Americans living in the United States.
You want us to talk about bitterness?
There are a lot of them.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and people for whom the country does not offer opportunities.
The only reason for the large number of Mexican ancestors in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that at some point, in our family tree, a person, perhaps a parent or a grandparent, found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And more often than not, this person was a typical profile -- dark, poorly educated skin, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we are currently living the American dream, having gone to good schools and having good situations, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living, not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We grant it to the United States.
On the other hand, we know that some of the Mexican elite among the ruling class does not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they kill us as if we were inferior and not sufficiently Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we wouldn't be stuck on the right side of the fence, living comfortably in the United States, but like lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who emigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there are friction between Mexicans and Mexico-Americans, because Mexicans are more firmly claiming their identity and Mexico-Americans are upset about it.
Although she is an American citizen, she feels she is part of two countries.
On the other hand, many of the Mexico-Americans I know don't feel like they're part of any country.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also that of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we are considered Americans.
And in the United States, we're considered Mexicans.
And now, to complicate the relationship a little more, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and part of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want Mexico Americans to work as bridesmaids ambassadors for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a superb country that must be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much bitterness.
And, considering the pervasive pay inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You're gonna have to deal with yourself, amigos.
That's normal.
While some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico Americans still resent them for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmm.
Maybe we're more Mexican than I thought.
Old quarrels, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there never be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such hope is futile.
While the same futile arguments persist as to who started, dozens of buildings have been destroyed; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed; and, for the first time, rockets fired from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be stuck in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab Spring has broken everything apart, and whether we want it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up in this regional upheaval.
Maybe their struggle will intensify a little more.
Yet there is every reason to believe that this could help them break this deadly deadlock.
A war that makes no losers or winners
At first glance, it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire on 21 November continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the supporters of force on both sides.
Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will be proud to have forced the Israelis to abandon, even though Gaza has suffered a beating.
Having killed some of its leaders and forced the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the most miserable and overcrowded corners of the world, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently in the hands of their Fatah rivals, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders might think that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is growing, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a booming regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken up the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states of the Golf.
Hamas members jubilate and say that the Islamist crescent is bending around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where Islamist rebels can overthrow Bashar El Assad, and to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern flank of Israel, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to devote to Hamas.
On the other hand, the Muslim Brotherhood is Hamas cousins, and their leaders are more likely to rely on public opinion.
In future diplomacy, Hamas can emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of Israel's hard line will draw the opposite conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas has been put back in a box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on both ears for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America is renewing its unwavering support; and many European countries have criticized Hamas for being at the root of the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel prospered, especially under Binyamin Netanyahu, the Prime Minister, who totally ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza had killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel had been spared the suicide bombings, including through the separation barrier that encroached on the West Bank, the main part of what might be a Palestinian state, and which protected Jewish settlements that continued to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Mr Netanyahu, whose Likud party has merged with an even more bellicist party, that of leader Avigdor Lieberman as the election of January 22 approaches, has the beautiful part.
Why are these damn Palestinians sleeping by giving them a state?
If they ran the West Bank, wouldn't they launch rockets, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It's best to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they pull their heads out.
Perhaps the supporters of the hard line will win; but the Arab spring may change the deal.
Even if the Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not like Israel, their priority will be to tackle the problems in their own countries.
Israel's defence budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbours combined.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their economies.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire, which bodes well -- and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder magazine that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel - much like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already weakening democracy in the Jewish state, and demography exacerbates this problem as the Arab population grows.
The bloody missions to Gaza every two or three years to ring Hamas will have diplomatic value.
Both sides need to be pushed by those outside.
The answer remains that advocated by the reasonable people on either side, and by most of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a transfer of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, small and short-term, is that the ceasefire will provide an opportunity for outside people to defend this cause.
Egypt, which must now work to end the flow of arms to Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with exchanges of land and shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs of outside countries should also exert pressure on Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming proposal of a pseudo-state at the United Nations.
Obama also has an interest in Israel agreeing to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
When he returned to the White House, he seemed equally reluctant to establish one.
It's a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital issue for America.
This requires a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Laws for Neutral Cigarette Packages came into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of brand
This law that came into force in Australia is a world first, logos and colors have been replaced by dark olive green and horrific pictures of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases were caused by their parents' smoking.
Apart from the various pictures and health warnings, the only difference between packages since Saturday is the brand name, printed in small print on all packages.
This is the most stringent tobacco packaging regime in the world.
The Australian federal government has stated that the goal is to discourage youth from smoking by eliminating glamorous representation.
Studies have shown that if people have not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never start.
"Even when they are very young, children understand the message conveyed by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with a princess. "
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinationals, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has put pressure on this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would re-energize the black market trade, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
"There will be adverse consequences from this legislation," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Counterfeiters in China and Indonesia will sell far more counterfeit cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others stated that the Act had boosted their activities.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said that the demand for cigarette cases, especially silicone to mask the horrible packaging, has increased sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco challenged the law and lost in Australia's high court.
Ha said that Zico sold 6,000 to wholesalers and is awaiting stock renewal.
For us, business is good.
The only boredom, the experts say, is the popularity of social media and the population group targeted by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for resellers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Web by local businesses and sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites from doing so.
"If you are working in tobacco marketing and you have only a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the most important place to go," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to brands on social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves whether it is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has taken the trouble to make a video, or whether it is a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia stated that the industry is focusing on the new regulations in place rather than on marketing.
Industry has gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new court decisions - these countries have told the WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries has had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in the course of 2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make warning photos on packaging mandatory in 2001.
These warnings are now available in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Stronger laws are currently under consideration in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
I don't mind the photos.
I don't know.
"You take a cigarette and put the package away," said Victor El Hage when buying a package with a picture of a tumor in his mouth.
To be honest, the only reason I'm gonna be arrested is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack tobacconist in central Sydney, said that uniform packaging made it difficult to store packages on displays.
"I used to need an hour to unload a package, now I need four hours," Yu said.
"The government just had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, that's okay, we stop and put the key under the door," he added, raising our arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during the Thanksgiving period because our plane was having mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I have had enough time to reflect on the theme of boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight is boring enough, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (not to mention duty-free shops).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in child development praise boredom.
It is perfectly normal for us - and our children - to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even nurture creativity.
And since we are, for the most part, constantly in front of several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome the boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
But I'll get back to it.
First of all, like many people, I thought boredom was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we had more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of Greco-Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"The boredom goes back a long way," he said.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti that evoke boredom, dating back to the first century.
Then there is the definition we give to boredom.
The problem is that it has been defined, and debated, in various ways, "said John D. Eastwood, Associate Professor of Psychology at York University, Ontario, Canada.
After reading numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as an experience that consists of "wanting to do something, but without successfully engaging in a satisfactory activity."
What differentiates boredom from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he said, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of boredom, he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, coupled with a cursed mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly."
The boredom can strongly resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be linked, people who get bored tend to think the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think that we are bored when it is actually a problem of concentration.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues highlighted an earlier experience in which participants listened on tape, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the room next door, the too high sound of a TV program that had no connection, others just heard the TV program, and the third group did not hear the soundtrack at all.
Those who heard TV at a low noise level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or challenging task, an interruption of attention can lead to boredom, said Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when you do a boring job, "like watching objects on a editing chain, music can help you not to get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you wiggle or scratch, these gestures, often seen as boredom, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to wiggle learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay still," said Professor Fenske.
We were all bored someday - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a single voice, a particularly boring film.
But some people are more likely to be bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "Boring Scale" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements like, "Among the tasks I do, many of them are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many interests that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers have found that boys tend to be bored more often than girls, "said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and in particular need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, teenagers are quickly blamed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, an individual and community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 per cent of teenagers reported being bored at school and during homework, while 23 per cent reported being bored when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 per cent of parents reported being bored.
Professor Larson stated that he did not know whether today's boredom percentages, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that "adolescence is a time when boredom reaches its highest level," especially because children and adolescents do not have much control over what they want to do.
If I ask again, is boredom good for you?
Sometimes no, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers evoke a link between boredom and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying the problem for more than two decades.
"The boredom is the way the brain found it to let you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a psychology professor at the N.Y.U.
But the brain doesn't always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child gets bored and you give him an iPad, he won't get bored anymore, but he won't have learned to take care of himself or self-care, says Professor Fenske.
And "this self-regulation goes from one situation to another," he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, he gets more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify boredom.
Just as I don't think we should criticize him either.
Feeling comfortable outside of the constant boiling of activities and technology is the goal we should strive for.
Professor Eastwood agrees on this point.
"We need to get bored more often, but the boredom arouses an acute and frenzy desire to be connected to something that makes sense," he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate the downtime.
"In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "it is difficult to find ways to get into something when the noise stops."
In Colorado, no guidelines for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19, a university student and football player in Colorado, is charged with something that will soon become legal in his condition: the possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco stated that one day, in September, he and some friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a summons for possession of drugs and equipment that could be used for his use - minor offences, each with a fine of $100 - and a date of appearance.
"We are treated like criminals," said Mr. Orozco.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado's vote to legalize the use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the response to hundreds of cases involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana have been closed.
The police have stopped charging adults 21 years of age and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative ridings have called for the acceleration of existing marijuana cases and continue to charge people with marijuana.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana sales businesses in their neighbourhoods.
"Things are changing so fast that I don't know what the future holds for us," said Daniel J. Oates, Aurora's chief of police, east of Denver.
Washington State regulators are also asking a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a permit system, allowing them to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - by the December 1, 2013 deadline.
They say that Colorado, whether we like it or not, is ahead of most of the regulatory states on marijuana, first on therapeutic use and now on personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, and is a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, Washington State Liquor Control Board spokesperson.
But no place or system, Mr. Smith acknowledges, can do more than suggest what works.
"There is no real precedent on which we could base ourselves," he said.
The Washington Act, known as I-502, takes effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permit system will still not exist, while the possession of marijuana will be legal.
At the same time, practical questions remain: how to balance the mandate of the state that ensures adequate access to licensed marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis sales within a 30 km radius around a school, park, playground or nursery.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to set up an approved cannabis sales business, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police, Oates, in Aurora, sent an e-mail to his officers announcing that the City Attorney would no longer prosecute persons 21 years of age and older who own small quantities of marijuana, and that the police should stop charging people for this type of crime "for immediate effect."
Chief Oates stated that the police would implement the new court decisions that regulate the activities of those who grow marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and drug dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, embodies a stricter vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession cases, primarily to put pressure on users to be detoxified.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many are charged with other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to prosecute those individuals who committed a crime that was, at the time of the incident, a recognized offence," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions were complicated even in rural areas such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the restricted marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer summon adults for possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the County Public Prosecutor's Office, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss all cases of marijuana detention without further action.
"I don't feel like I'm wasting my time applying the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters supported the measure, providing an appropriate legal and government framework for personal marijuana use is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different American cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials regarding the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents people accused of marijuana use and who speaks as a local spokesperson for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They spent a good part of their lives suing people who used marijuana, so they find it difficult to accept it as legal," he said.
As the first states to treat restricted marijuana use at the same level as alcohol, Colorado and Washington are becoming a case law for legalizing drugs.
While advocates and government officials are planning a new legalized sales border, they are looking forward to the federal government's directives, which still view the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of legalizing marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice will give up.
Despite some media arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and vendors, the federal government has primarily allowed marijuana businesses for therapeutic purposes to practice in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police are not likely to break down doors to seize small bags of drugs, it is likely that they are opposed to licensed businesses selling marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political advisor to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not waited for federal authorities to act.
Long before the vote, some local governments approved moratoria on the creation of new marijuana sales, although this is only a one-year postponement.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a moratorium of 6 months, and is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to end up in a situation where a permit is granted to someone and then we're faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the City Council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions arise.
Petronella Wyatt: I was abused and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory."
It is not only the students of today who are being attacked for their opinions.
As far as I can remember, I've always dreamed of entering Oxford University.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an eminent place to know, a kind of Greek amphitheatre of modern times that stimulates the two pillars of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
Yet, two weeks after I moved to Worcester College in the late 1980s to study history, I decided to pack my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started crying.
My friends were confused.
The newspaper of L'Evening Standard claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that undergraduate students had sex in the room next to mine.
Author A. N. Wilson facetically stated that I had left after being forced to drink in chipped cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I fled because I had been intimidated and subjected to constant bullying.
Not because of my rather outrageous name, or because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this cradle of the so-called knowledge, I was the victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential councillor of Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why mention this today, you will tell me.
Well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of right-centre students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such that last week some of them demanded the protection of their rights, just as those of gays, people with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The conservative members of the Corpus Christi College Student Hall (JCR) said that they were "often isolated, personally attacked and felt undesirable" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative on the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their views can be expressed freely.
Their situation was not facilitated by the recent BBC Two documentary "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right," which focused on student politics and portrayed "Tories" as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among other things, Joe Cooke, a former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA), who travels in Rolls-Royce, has a silver finish and moves with a chrome-headed cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as scapegoats for the introduction of tuition increases. "
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, told a Sunday newspaper "there is a growing leftist bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, President of OUCA, says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of JCR members towards right-centre people.
"This is an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," she said.
I was the only one who thought that way in my first weeks at Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and paralyzing shy.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
In the previous year, the university had voted against granting Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of the reduction in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalinist vibrations.
From the first days of the welcome week, when the new students met the others and the teachers, I had a taste of what was going to happen afterwards.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasm towards the Tory students, but also took pleasure in it.
It was as if the policy on striking minors, privatization and government opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa were engraved in the wood of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I suffered was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph"
I lost my feet.
Pitt, a little man with a pustular face, was easily carried away.
"Do Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears were burning my eyes.
"I suggest you take French classes during your free time - if you're not too busy making friends," he said.
I went back to my room, inconsolable.
At dinner that night, I sat alone and then felt a slight slap on my shoulder.
He was a second-year student in English, named James, who introduced himself as a member of OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said, nicely.
I'm afraid so.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is targeted.
It's hard enough for me, but they know your dad's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even harder for you.
Most Tory young people claim to be Labour (Labour).
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to hide.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs Thatcher had said.
This stratagem failed.
A first-year student in philosophy, political science and economics who ironically studied in Eton, said, "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're contaminated.
Other students have taken over the chorus.
I was perverted, dirty.
"How do the Tories make love?" asked one of them.
They're hitting each other, aren't they? "
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the sixties.
Would I have only been able to lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after dark?
Should I have become Labour and denied my opinions?
The next three years were going to look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, professor of modern history, who was teaching in my university.
He was hated not only because he was conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy advisor to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as his adherence to the Marxist-determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a teaching position at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said.
I started commuting between Oxford and my parents' home in London, finding refuge with my family and friends more open-minded.
I told my father I hated Oxford and I explained why.
He was unbelieving.
During his studies at Oxford in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But this is the best place in the world," he said, pathologically.
They wouldn't do that, not in the town of dreamy bells.
Even my communist friends had impeccable manners.
He had tears in his eyes.
Give them a chance.
I'm sure it's to tease you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
Tired by my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance has gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, succumbed to pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a session of work conducted the following week, when another history teacher suggested the most serious in the world, that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Rushing internally with shame, I admitted to being a victim of my parents' brainwashing and calling them "old madmen."
The respite was short-lived.
It was my father who put the last nail in my oxfordian coffin.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was locked.
I just stood in my room and, after five minutes, my prosecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never went back.
You can call me a weeping chicken.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such intimidation in a school.
The most tragic thing is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 prime ministers, Tory, but also enjoyed an unshakeable reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance over notoriety"
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: A Master of Couture," inaugurated this week in London, ABC interviewed Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place of British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: A Master of the Couture," a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he said with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the highlight of a story whose only protagonist is "he signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the cream of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophies of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, in the north of Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There's nothing wrong with loving royalty.
"At least they don't crush their cigarette butts on your beautiful carpet like some pop music stars do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 1960s and 1970s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and welcomes with generosity and elegance.
"We all adored being invited to his cottage in Gstaad," explains former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate friend of past beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino model
The Argentinian model, Valeria Mazza, has also not forgotten the charisma of the designer.
Several years ago, after a parade on the Place d'Espagne in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his spirit in every detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"With him, each guest felt important and appreciated," recalls the "top model," which began working with him during the week of the Haute-Couture in Paris in 1995.
"He will never pass fashion, because his creations are works of art," she concludes.
String of nobility
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared loves.
He loves well-educated people and with the greatest titles and they love him too.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a sixty-metre-wide glamorous podium that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to march on the podium to admire a dream "audience" carrying Valentino's main creations, such as the tailor that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage to Aristotle Onassis, the costume Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a wool and fur coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
Among this audience of models are names such as Sybille de Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norvège, Rosario de Bulgarie or Sophie de Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the couturier in 2006
Many of his clients say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
These were trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he gave me," said Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to all the others because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he sublimates our beauty," adds the ex-Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses, they're bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and opportunity to wear one of her evening dresses...
Finally, this was possible in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Ligne.
It was a red evening dress, with a flying skirt, a draped bustier and a neckline to fall off.
"It was a dream come true," said Rodrigue of Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with timeless," explains the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the designer's evening dresses with "the greatest care, because an evening dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it conveys."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress worn during her marriage to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the designer calls his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearl inlay, twelve different kinds of lace and a four-and-a-half-metre drag.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historical fact of the haute couture of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the upper society."
For years obsessed with the "know-how" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, decorated with the Légion d'Honneur, Garavani receives as many honours as any spouse of his clients.
"Her refinement, her calm, her neat and perfect look have always jumped in my eyes," admits d'Arenberg.
Last time I saw him, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was impeccable, years have no effect on him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest job in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone paths.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living carrying the sulfur of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of Indonesia's island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulphuric gas from the earth's entrails solidifies in contact with the air.
After collecting large sulfur rocks, which weigh a total of nearly 70 kilos, he installs them in two bamboo baskets, which he loads on his shoulders through steep trails.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which peaks at 2,386 metres, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb that distance, at a turtle's pace, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so as not to stumble and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who made a fatal fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents euro for every kilo of sulphur extracted.
Once on the top, he makes a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and carrying the heavy baskets painfully, they walk the 3 kilometers to the scale that a mining company has installed a little below at 1.850 meters altitude.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been operating the volcano since 1960 and, it can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) per kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry at Rs 10,000 (83 euro cents) since it is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As we transport about 70 kilos, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) every trip," explains Anto, who usually makes three trips a day.
Each takes 3 hours and he ends up exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rupees (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a misery for such a superhuman effort, it is three times what it would earn in the fields.
"The income of miners is very high here, where coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros) per day and where the average monthly wage is two million rupees (167 euros)," says the bearer who used to work as a mason on Bali's tourist island.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) per day and the job was not as difficult, but Anto returned to his family in Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her back to Java to convert to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and her eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
When he was 27, he spent three of his life defying the danger on the Kawah ljen, but the sulfur has already begun to charge him the bill although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
That's the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
"I'm going to work for another two years, because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
This friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, a waiter or a receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
He shares an unhealthy wood stick with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to gush at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of the darkness.
Defiant of darkness, Anto descends into the crater by lighting himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 carriers charge the baskets with sulphur on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur extraction to save costs and does not provide equipment to self-employed and weight-paid carriers.
In addition, they also do not receive one under 30,000 rupees (2.50 euros) per camera, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is done for animals, not for humans," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old corpulent carrier who has been working at Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Capable of carrying up to 110 kilos, he assures that he will not stop working "while he can," because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18.
I won't retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps miners in the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hardened that no one complains about suffering from serious diseases... to which are obviously added their usual respiratory problems, arthroses, pains in the knees and shoulders, distorted by the weight of baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can only load 50 kilos.
Every day, his companions extracted 15 tons of sulphur from the volcano, which three trucks carried to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometres away by a path of goats invaded by weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano is my whole life," Unainik says by opening his mouth well, revealing several missing teeth.
The older of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult jobs in the world: that of the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano.
Singapore looking for babies to save the economy
Singaporeans place responsibility for this lack of children on the career, stress and cost of access to property.
"Singapore's population must grow."
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civic duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for mint pastilles, but despite that, or perhaps because of that, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The lyrics come from a rap group that uses local references like "Let's put a polichinelle in the drawer" to make fun of Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency behind the video, hopes to draw attention to the problem in a fun way thanks to this advertising.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music to make people "fulfill their national duty."
It is intended solely for the Internet, so we have been able to make it entertaining and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of birth, so we felt that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things like throwing pheromone scents or holding speed-dating parties.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we said to each other the following thing: what is more creative about solving this problem than making it a rap song?
1.2 children
The Singapore government does not take it so lightly.
He spends US $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure in favour of marriages and fathers grants up to $15,000 per child, increases maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all of this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore & apos; s birth rate, in line with its national population distribution, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
Why then don't Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy of the National Population Division, says this is due to "better education" and "a wider choice of career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and family formation," she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to an increase in the number of single persons and to delays in marriage and birth, resulting in a decrease in Singapore's birth rate.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that abound in xenophobia barely disguised against new immigrants, especially those Chinese who are accused of pulling wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapore party experienced its worst election results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to correct the problem with the introduction of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While falling birth rates have known effects on a country's economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has begun to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as the "shoe box," that can be built in specific areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale is very successful.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers wishing to build large family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, general manager of the real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger homes.
They are more popular, in the sense that these dwellings are built much faster than larger ones.
For this reason, it is much more profitable for our cash flow.
However, he admitted that the new standards gave clearer instructions to developers, who were previously put on the wheels if they wanted to offer too many small housing units in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If these new regulations can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, by discussing with Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the centre, they do not seem to have much effect.
"People are very stressed, homes are expensive, just like education, that's why people postpone it," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and my time," says another 20-year-old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of access to property and education as reasons for not having children.
Thus, although the government is trying to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, it is the Singaporeans themselves who have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
Confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Spanish Royal Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of private life that we can protect from any intrusion."
What is the private domain for people under 16?
How can this definition be applied in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting events on the Internet that he would certainly not share off-line?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged between 10 and 15, frequent users of the canvas.
In four cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on a personal level with "password and username" when applied to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years, when he tries to explain the meaning of the private term on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had an account for two years.
"These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them but not everyone," he says.
On FB, I post nice pictures or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I won't share one of my photos or someone who would be a fool," he says.
The young boy acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked people, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine followers on Twitter.
The majority are family members.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I just post them," he adds.
"Social networks are fun, I can talk to distant relatives or friends, quickly," he says.
He claims that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
Nor will he trust anyone who would recommend a stranger to him.
José's case, 14, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits not to know 20 of the people on his list of friends.
"I'm not worried because we have something in common, such as music," he says.
According to the young boy, no one made advances to him or asked for his address or telephone number.
"If they put pressure on me or demanded it, I would simply remove it from my account," he admits.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences that are known today as cyberbullying are not alien to the young boy.
A close relative of a friend of mine was racketed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he says.
The victim, according to José, did not close her account.
"He only passed it into a private profile."
He then explains to us a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of knowledge in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I was angry or upset.
"Even if I know it's cyber harassment," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a professor of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that, in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet has emerged as a way of looking for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," she says.
Porras reports that the academician Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and author of the book "Native and Digital Immigrants," uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we are learning ourselves," she says.
He added that the theme is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what should or should not be disclosed, published or said at an age when they do not have the maturity to do so."
"We also ask them to be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't help," she says.
Then Porras lists a few examples: there are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to publish a picture of you like that of a friend you published?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify photos of parties, do you ask other people for permission to identify them?
And also, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks," she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary teacher and education counsellor, said it was essential for parents to read the conditions for using social networks conscientiously.
By understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that foreigners should not be spoken to.
The Unasur Summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the Lima Declaration having been made public, although it was previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven representatives present.
Efe tried several times to access the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency initially indicated that it would be disclosed after the summit had closed, and then stated that it would be published from time to time on the Peruvian Government's website.
When asked about the text, they reported that its content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information circulated among journalists was that given by press officers of some of the governments of Unasur who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who were demanding more important information.
Later, Peru's presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was President Humala's speech and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South America-Arab Countries Summit (ASPA) and, on that occasion, although this was requested by the press, it had also not disseminated the declaration also known as the Lima Declaration, as previously announced.
On the official ASPA website, it can be verified that the document was published last March.
In both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to set up safe transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited the availability of information to the maximum extent possible.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that determines a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and declared that they would respect the ICJ's decision to hear the arguments of both parties in the trial that Lima brought against Santiago, which begins on Monday in The Hague.
"We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes that we are bringing before this international court today," said President Humala, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has always been, and will continue to be, a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful resolution of international disputes, treaties and tribunals," added President Piñera, giving President Humala a handshake alongside the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of the two Presidents that they would submit to the ICJ took place after Colombia had denounced the Bogota Pact this week, by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua which it considered to be seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the Unasur since 2011 after the removal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
Host President Ollanta Humala was instructed to open the deliberations in the morning and close the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The Representative read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been set between the South American countries for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the Unasur countries would put in place "important steps to achieve the goal of South American citizenship through the development of agreements on residence permits."
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions to improve access to medicines, low-cost Internet access throughout South America, and to jointly and effectively assess the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, "economic consolidation (of Latin America) must not have a triumphalist matrix but must help to increase our productive matrix and to see a better future for our people," concluded President Humala.
"We have decided to favour a group of 31 emblematic projects that improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic channels," said the Peruvian President in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were located on the transversal axes of his territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed for a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give any further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the country's electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbours, is another theme discussed at the summit.
In this sense, the Colombian President, Juan Manuel Santos, stated, before starting the regional meeting, that he hoped to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, the following Saturday in Mexico City to discuss the maritime dispute calmly through a ruling of the ICJ requested by Bogota.
"It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said President Santos.
"We are going to revise all these avenues, they are not exhaustive, including the treaty with Nicaragua, which will ask for a discussion with that country," he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we are going to settle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," added President Santos.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have planned to witness the takeover of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, at the summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of the Unasur, although the latter is suspended.
Peru holds the pro tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America needs to learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," says Rafael Correa.
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was an objective for which "South America, in this case, should take the example of Europe."
President Correa, who took part in the Sixth Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, said on State TV, TV Peru, that Europeans "had killed each other in the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "but that they were now almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the plan to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of the Unasur.
"We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past," he warned.
In addition, the Ecuadorian President was in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OAS) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San José Pact on Human Rights.
Those who beat our ears back never compromise anything, on the contrary, we South Americans have all signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself did not betray his principles, but on the contrary he respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He concluded that at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
In addition, he criticized the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to undergo an interrogation on his territory in connection with an alleged sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation allows this to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's mental and physical health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, but nothing serious," said Ecuadorian President.
It is possible that his physical and mental health will deteriorate by being locked up in a small space without being able to exercise in the open air.
"It affects everyone's health," he concludes.
Correa points out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, which would be the award of a safe-conduct to enable him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, and points out that he has had discussions in London to find a solution to the confinement of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of Great Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a series of proceedings in various European bodies," he said.
And he thinks that "if Britain granted safe driving tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation quite allows, and as it has already done in other cases, questioned Mr Assange in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or questioned him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and said that what he did not tolerate was "mediocrity, bad faith and lies that undermine freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not malicious or perverse politicians but bad journalists at the expense of greed, blackmail and extortion," he said.
From this perspective, he welcomed the fact that it was not that kind of journalists "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador" and, rather than highlighting his re-election, "he would deepen the revolution to continue the path and chart the right path."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the vet on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the next elections, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised attempts at coup d'état," because in reality, "it destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
Moreover, the Ecuadorian President considers "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court in The Hague, which will strengthen Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this judgement is not respected.
This is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
We need to solve them as a whole to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he expressed confidence in the proper resolution of the dispute over maritime borders between Peru and Chile in the same court and affirmed that "it is beneficial for Latin America to bring its case before international bodies if both countries agree to accept a judgment as firm as it may be."
Referring to the possibility of his being nominated for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, with a view to running for a third consecutive term, he pointed out that he saw this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although it is sometimes quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the February 2013 primaries, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can be resolved only through political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this possible victory, but we must accept this responsibility," he said.
If I won, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will.
"It's my decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked to Venezuelan Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the campaign to end and return to Cuba.
"This does not mean a relapse into President Chávez's state of health," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which concluded with a call for better regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are now due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed with the test result: HIV-positive.
"It was as if the sky had fallen on my head," he said, referring to the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "less painful," in vain.
The young man hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it and his hard work was such that he had just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), in which he found himself in 1994 after many battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, where there was a lot of doubt, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was speechless."
At that time, having AIDS meant death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, in any case after the first reported cases, "the great victory today is that the survival of a patient who has started treatment at the right time and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's head of the HIV unit, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, and he takes as his reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
The infectiologist and HIV / AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and the quality of life depend on the level of immune system assignment that patients had at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 levels of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach 500 CD4 levels.
Simply put, this means that for someone who receives a positive HIV diagnosis at age 25, "as long as he or she remains under control, he or she will be able to live without problems until he or she is 75 years old," the scientist interviewed explained.
In order to put this progress into context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While it is true that mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of AIDS-related deaths increased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (according to the UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that, since the onset of AIDS, 60 per cent of the patients registered on the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs has been universal since 2005.
Then why are there still deaths?
I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened in our hospital.
Over the past 12 years at least, we have never lacked medication, the problem is that patients are reaching very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact: "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to carry out earlier diagnoses and, in order to do so, to offer massive screening tests to all those who request it."
The specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as do the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his testing in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and, despite his young age, he was already carrying AIDS and suffering from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer tumour that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and don't want to know.
"If I'm going to die, I better have fun three times a week," they say, "I'm not.
The change has been beneficial, I eat well, I exercise, I take my medication.
To date, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the march of World AIDS Day.
Let them test, if they have taken risks, the sooner they will know if they are HIV-positive and the better, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that we can live like everyone else, by being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms on the counter
There are many gaps between health programmes and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the biggest thing is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of 100, it is very good, but as a result, still today, some do not have access to condoms," he says.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
The question, "What are you going to do with it?," put up with sarcasm and value judgments by social workers, guidance counsellors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, says the journalist.
He proposed that this inefficient distribution be redirected; that condoms not only be sold at counters, but be found in public toilet dispensers and in places frequented by young people.
It's not about encouraging promiscuity.
Nor was it a question of paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had replied when asked if there would be a distribution of condoms within his administration.
"It's not how sexuality works, it's best to provide condoms to people who are already sexually active," he said.
Figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS cases and 1,317 HIV cases).
The State is the fourth largest State in the country in terms of the number of new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th in terms of the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections occur by sexual route, 6% by blood route and 2% by perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each case registered, there are 4 or 5 people who do not know about it.
A judgment ratified on appeal by a United States court ignores the restructuring of the Vitro group's debt through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a bad precedent for all domestic companies with branches in the neighbouring country and with solvency problems.
It therefore seems that the procedures for the survival of companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment handed down on 15 June by Judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Bankruptcy for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies defenceless in the face of the possibility of embargoes of their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the leading glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States on the basis of three inconsistencies.
First, while the trial judge points out that creditors must register under the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeal Court, based in New Orleans, states that the main proceeding is formal commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing cooperation in cross-border proceedings in insolvency cases involving companies with a cross-border profile.
Indeed, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law had been created for that purpose by taking the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts incurred by Vitro's subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for approval of the restructuring could not have been obtained.
However, Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, Vitro's case is not the first to use this plan.
Here there are half a dozen examples, among them Agromex and Comercial Mexicana, whose debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy.
Moreover, what is certain is that, since there were still the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case Vitro's creditors who fought against it in the courts of the United States, that is, the "vulture" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would have been 45 to 37.
A data omitted by the appellate court.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he had been facing since 2008 without stopping at the serious economic crisis facing the United States, passing on the costs to the country.
For the time being, the González Sada family society will appeal to the same appellate court to have the vote taken in its entirety, that is, with the five magistrates, since only three had voted.
The insurance action will demand non-prosperity and require a review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court of Justice.
The most serious thing is that the court ignored a document sent by the Mexican government on behalf of the amicus curiae ("friend of the court") in which Vitro's procedure under the Commercial Bankruptcy Act was detailed, pointing out that it freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to bring it up to the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, he pointed out that the country had complied with the United Nations Commission on International Trade, namely the rules for cross-border insolvency, which ensured fairness for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they kill Vitro and they kill the country.
Overview
The complaints of the unions of the Mexican Aviation Society against the former boss of the company, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, were ignored for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Association Syndicale des Pilotes Aviateurs has already encountered problems.
The body, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just submitted a criminal application against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to him, the inspection authority systematically denied having provided information to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the contractor to withdraw from fiduciary F / 589 of bank IXE 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds were allegedly used for the purchase of shares of the Hotel Professional Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
They're besieging the Dragon Mart.
Meeting this weekend in an amphitheatre at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society approved the creation of a broad opposition front at the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the country of the Great Wall, with a housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had succeeded in uniting the governors of the South-East zone in order to oppose the monumental project which is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
ACTA is dead
The government put forward a Senate requirement to explain under which terms and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan had signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this theme is already in ancient history.
As everyone knows, this was done well that the Senate itself condemned this possibility, as it was seen as an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, the real estate developer Homex has entered the stock exchange market for 500 million pesos.
This issue of securities is the first of four programs for which they propose to pay interest every 28 days.
Birth of the summer
Integrated by NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading IT companies, a new consortium with the name of Compeété has just been formed, with the aim of the market for clustering software services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is my whole life"
The globe-trotter of basketball "Hetin" Reyes spent more than 60 years of his life in relation to the field and, thanks to him, travelled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of local basketball as great as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain hemorrhage condemned him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether as a lower league player, national basketball team player, manager and leader of the national team, the BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as president of the basketball federation.
"I have worn several caps in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation during the 1990s," Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball is my whole life."
Reyes doesn't exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and souvenirs that remind him of his unusual itinerary, bear witness to this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the ones he loved most were those who reminded him of his time as a player on the Vaqueros team in the mid-1950s until 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or manager of the team.
"It was my best years, the ones I took the most advantage of because I had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships from 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or leader.
It's been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired to the championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took the lead, "says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been a leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a strong player for you, he's two meters tall.
Do you want it? "
That's how to start Mincy, one of Puerto Rico's best players.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of the best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us try to win another.
He was delighted with the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great champion of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his and Mincy's charges on the national team.
I remember when we first won it in the United States at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico City in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and should have won the bronze medal if that Canadian judge hadn't played us the last game, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Cup team the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, as was the one who beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite is the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won gold and beat the United States team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 because of a knee problem.
A team that may not have been the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and great joy at the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the imbroglio of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we have won gold against all prognosis.
What was Puerto Rico's best player?
Without a doubt, this is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics at international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level as did Piculín.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues he played for.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's very hard to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work Leo Arill does.
For you, what is your greatest success in the federation?
Being part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s, BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have liked to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys play only in their area and compete only with teams from other parts of the island during national playoffs.
Today, young people travel and play too much when this is not necessarily necessary.
At least I saw the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and arbitrators.
It makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to music, watch music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally watch basketball games.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became known worldwide by the lead role of John Ross Ewing, better known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas," in which he represented an unscrupulous, formidable and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as unscrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday night of complications of cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for the Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his dear hometown of Dallas, playing the ironic role he loved most again," the family said.
Larry's family and close friends were with him in Dallas on that Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who was interpreting his wife's role in the original series and in the rest, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press secretary, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and I'm going to miss him a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he was living his life," Gray said in a press release.
The doctors had diagnosed liver cirrhosis in Larry Hagman in 1992 and he admitted to drinking a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant liver tumor and had a transplant.
Several years before "Dallas," Hagman had made himself known on television as an ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and brought her home.
He has also played in two comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among his movie roles are well received by critics in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was thanks to his masterful interpretation of the deliciously disgraceful J.R. that Larry Hagman had his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who killed J.R.?," invented to maintain the suspense around an episode full of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculation around the world and millions of dollars played in bets.
As a result, among other things, the series reached a record audience at that time.
When the response was revealed in an episode in November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers were in front of their screens and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had brought together 50 million viewers.
It was J.R. 's sister-in-law, Kristin (performed by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. had made her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she did not leave the city, but other people also had reasons to assault her.
Hagman played Ewing's role as a corrupted and insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and an unfaithful husband trying to put his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen in prison (Linda Gray).
"I know what it would take as an epitaph for J.R," Hagman said in 1988.
We should write, "This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a man "immense, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of all of us, who have had the chance to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in the process of being realized, informed the channel.
For the time being, neither Warner nor TNT have communicated how Hagman's death will be included in the series.
Originally from Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who enjoyed fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He took his first steps on the scenes of New York theatres in the early 1950s and served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
It was there that he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin ': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin': Les mémoires merritoyables de J.R)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt anyone or affect them in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donation activist and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist worried patients.
"I advise them, I trust them again, I come with them when they come for surgery and then," he says in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them some comfort, like, "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it'll be fine."
He has also been a tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
A course on the "End of the World" has just begun
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the religion teacher Stuart Charme decided to give a lecture on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irresistible hook there: the end of the "big count" of the Maya calendar, on December 21, to which many people refer as proof of the end of the imminent world.
But Professor Charme had no idea what was expected of him in the following months: the catastrophic hurricane Sandy, a tax abyss that some have dubbed "the Armageddon of Debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever known," Professor Charme told his students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we look at what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and told it, it was a very good time.
And it must be remembered that what is evil is good for those who believe in apocalypse.
And he's not the only teacher to lecture on "the end of the world" this semester, which will, in theory, be the last in history.
In Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker teaches the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides some human conduct.
If nuclear weapons fell into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and explore how they can be compared with real-life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what was possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed up to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World."
"We add" 2012 "to have the opportunity to give the course again, in case the world does not disappear," said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster," students must study, create projects and pass their final exams.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final exam will be passed the day before the Apocalypse, which does not leave students of any choice but to work "until the very night of the supposed end of the world," Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
"It was completed in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-level students, composed of 35 students.
We received e-mail messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
The students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It fascinates me to see what people can do to comfort themselves," says Bridney Robinson, a 23-year-old student in religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of Revelation, whether secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student in Psychology and Nursing, claims to have watched all apocalyptic films.
"I had never heard of a course that taught this subject," he said.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed, let alone a professor, told us that they believed in the end of the world on December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it," says Julie zegle, a 21-year-old last-year student at Temple from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world, it's only a key date on the calendar, "restall said.
But I concede that there is an anxiety linked to apocalypse in Western culture, dating back several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has given rise to such speculation.
"In other parts of the world, people don't think about it," he says.
Most of it is the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religious professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, answered quickly when asked if he knew that he was giving courses here on "the end of the world."
"The Philippines is not participating in the end of the world," he replied, as if it were an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall points out that over the years there has been talk of the many supposed dates of the last judgment, and he says that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately start thinking about the next date" or to philosophize that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date lightly.
Many told us that they thought they were going to "end-of-the-world" parties.
"Sometimes I call friends and we laugh at each other," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
