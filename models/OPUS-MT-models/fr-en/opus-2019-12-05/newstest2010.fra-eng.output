Barack Obama to be the fourth US President to receive Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours and be the fourth American President in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be awarded to him, among other things, for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a busy program.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the very first time the five members of the Committee who selected him in October among 172 people and 33 organizations.
The planning of the presidential couple then included an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He would be the fourth American president to receive it, but only the third who would be awarded the prize in the Committee itself.
The White House informed in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan when the award was presented.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this prize by being a president who is waging a war in two countries at the moment.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of 10 million Swedish crowns (about 1.1 million Euros).
He intends to donate it to charitable organizations, but has not yet decided in concrete terms which ones.
His busy program will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Head of Government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to pay that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he was not fully deserving of it.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for him alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said that it would be an "invitation to act."
A nature defender accused of blackmail
The Litoměřice police charged the president of the society of nature protectors of Litoměřice with blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction works procedures and asked for money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokesman of the Litoměřice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litoměřice is Lubomír Studnička.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years' imprisonment.
Waste sorting dumpsters are not scented in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packages, while in the villages of Moravia of the South you fall on sorting dumpsters at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
Now, you'd have to take a few minutes before you find the right dumpster.
I don't mean to say we wouldn't sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I have the impression that the city councillors of our second largest city in the country are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially in view of the number of dumpsters dedicated to this waste.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in downtown?
It is a whole science, which requires mostly time and nerves of steel.
The only place I've found at the moment is Moravia Square in front of Potrefena Husa.
I don't want Mr. Onderka and his colleagues to be mad at me, but it doesn't seem like a damn thing to me.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the city it's not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don't sort their garbage.
Out of laziness.
It makes them a trunk to get to the dumpster.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to go throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except I didn't notice any coloured dumpster on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I found the right place when I went to take the tram.
That being said, the waste was overflowing.
It's after all the center of Brno, which is supposed to best represent the city, isn't it?
It is probably that ecology and so-called aesthetics are not too interested in Brno's socialists.
They prefer to buy the city a place in the first hockey league that embarrasses the city across the country, instead of buying a few more dumpsters and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I'm glad I was able to reinforce my impression with official statistics after hanging out for a while on the Internet.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire South Moravian region.
Paroubek's budget has taken away silver pensions and sick leave
After the left has increased, despite the advice of the government, farmers or civil servants it may be that there is a shortage of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on State debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will govern in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back to the ground," Janota said.
It should be noted that interest payable on borrowed money is increasing and will have to be returned sooner or later.
The state does not really have the choice of where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social assistance or its expenditure, it will have to raise taxes.
To all those who the left has now increased: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And then their children.
People will touch them and must not fear for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of greater government debt - next year it will not miss 163 billion in the cashiers, but more.
In spite of Janota's efforts, the debt will grow faster and faster, and with it, interest-related spending.
The state will need money to pay it back and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce maternity leave as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
It will also miss five billion to complete the construction of roads and railways because of the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly already decided and initiated sections, and it is not possible to modify the projects in order to reduce costs.
At most keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major projects, and the EU funding is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The ČSSD has proposed to solve the financial deficit very skilfully - it will draw from the dividends of the ČEZ (supplier and distributor of electric energy), which the state mainly owns and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of the dividends is never certain and that in no case is it a bottomless well.
Last year, 18 billion were sailed from ČEZ to the budget.
Every year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of ecological damage, to supplement pension accounts, or are they used as a reserve for the pension reform that is being prepared.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7% of GNP under EU rules.
And this is far from the end of the carnival of transfers.
The budget for various reparations to the victims of communism and crime, or even housing savings, has decreased by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, says Janota.
The Minister will then have to save on the department's side or, at worst, touch on the government's budgetary reserve.
There is also a shortfall of $100 million in the $2 billion state fund project, which is designed to track on-line the expenditures of each jurisdiction.
The first stage will start in January.
If the finance minister could not find money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and sanctions would be imposed, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the objective of the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them into personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of the VMware company in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and a first demonstration was made a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB RAM memory, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers should have access to devices during 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains bothers hoteliers
Deserted runways are not only a problem for ski lift operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking skiing in hotels and hostels.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visits to our site.
Netizens browse offers, ask for prices but do not dare to make reservations at the moment.
And if they call us, they ask right away if there will be snow or mud at Christmas, "said Martin Jandura, operator of the news portal Spindl.Info." It's a good idea to be here. "
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in Špindlerv Mlýn, it is better not to hesitate to book too much.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of the accommodation comes only after, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The Špindler hoteliers currently offer only one week's stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they're going to try to place them for a while, but they're also going to give up and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will rapidly decrease, "Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in Christmas Week for the time being, it is not completely sold.
There's still free, say, half the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheapest last-minute Christmas stays, "said the director of Ingtours Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency can also offer the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are fewer free places.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell moderately.
This year's interest in winter stays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for her to go down.
No one wants to spend the winter on the mountain without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will also be complete, "Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few final seats for New Year's as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January Polish and February also sells well, "says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia Hotel near the central car park of Jánské Láznž is also 80 percent complete during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the most recent hotel in Jánské Láznā.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupation at the moment.
February is a little weaker for the moment but as soon as the snow falls, interest in staying in the Krkonoše will certainly grow again, said Hotel Manager Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
However, Krkonoše hoteliers should not expect more snow.
Thursday it will be cooler and if there is precipitation, they should be snowy in the mountains.
But later, the weather should warm up, informs Jiří Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
United States: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comical, the strenuous effort with which Barack Obama, President with the reputation of being wise, reproduces his predecessor's strategy on the Afghan question, which he himself considered to be very simple.
When he finally let his longed-for doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it to carbon paper since Bush's Iraqi scenario three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even several times the phrase "as in Iraq," he did not hesitate, moreover, to use the title of Bush's speech of January 2007 as the title of his own speech: "A new road forward"
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush's idea of sending new reinforcements to an Iraq consumed by the civil war as "irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences."
The following months, however, showed that Bush's strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of campaign commanders, was the only one possible and likely to be so successful that newspapers at present do not speak of Iraq at all.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, however, objectively speaking, he left his successor a much more favourable final situation than could be expected.
Barack Obama hopes that in Afghanistan, the miracle will recur
It was again the campaign commanders who asked him to increase the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even severely criticized the White House's reluctance despite the habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The president hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better option, he at least swindled the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It succeeded in extracting the promise of another 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What brings the most problems in Obama's entire strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies of Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process within three years. Obama's whole doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same results as the increase in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honour the agreements.
The Afghan situation is marked by the exact opposite - no one can be relied on and no treaty is respected.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their leadership on a day-to-day basis, according to what suits them.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain nothing but powder in the eye behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is particularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in the light of the lack of clarity in relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "prompt state to act," which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is puzzled by his wildness.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is currently on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the small soldiers sent into the tumult of war for their "quick return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the withdrawal of troops is simply irresponsible, as the Taliban will consider it an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is turning negative.
European policies do not know or want to explain to their constituents how security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of Hindu Kush.
Another factor that can radically alter the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the strengthened sanctions do not affect the Iranian people, the Americans will find themselves faced with the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
It will have to be answered, for example, when, according to Obama, America comes to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution would, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rustin for Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time for him to work on a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executive employees of the U.S. bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 leaders will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell for five years.
Shares can be withdrawn from managers in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort to link rewards with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I guess Wall Street is well aware of the global meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of the JPMorgan company
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs Bank has become the target of criticism after setting aside almost $17 billion for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, strong banking premiums have become a sensitive political issue in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to allocate a single 50 per cent tax on bankers' bonuses in excess of £25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year women have won Nobel prizes in all fields except physics
It is five women, a record number, who today received the Nobel Prize in technical disciplines and literature from the Swedish King Charles XVI Gustave in Stockholm.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, were awarded with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The chemistry award was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of the ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with his compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn't have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to scientists Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical glasses.
Each recipient received the diploma, Nobel medal and certificate of achievement of the monetary award.
It reaches SEK 10 million in each category. (approximately EUR 1.1 million)
If one of them has more than one winner, they will share the reward with each other.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award, since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
At the expense of his policy, he added that in certain situations war is indispensable for achieving peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota plans to resign. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive finance minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is laying down his stay in the government because of his disagreement with the state budget for next year as it was voted by the Chamber of Deputies
It is estimated that Janota's budget, and perhaps Janota's position in the cabinet, will be on the agenda for their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
In his view, the deficit was too large, which further exacerbated the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his position on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
Nevertheless, on Wednesday the Chamber of Deputies approved the proposals of the left regarding money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government criticized the Social Democrats' proposals for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left on the one hand, the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, which called into question the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, ČSSD and the Green Party.
Critics say that the budget, as it was voted by MEPs, removes the package of savings measures put in place by Fischer's government, which, in his view, must contain the state's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the State Budget Act but has no obligation to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irreparable deficiency" of public finances.
Now, in his view, there is no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could build on a broader political party consensus, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said that the budget is appalling and that the government should question its future existence.
ODS Vice-President Petr Nečas told ČTK that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer described such words as "drastic verdicts."
ČSSD leader Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former Topolánek government is appalling and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the ČSSD declared the ratification of the State budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that Hollywood Invictus - Invanqucu's new film will expose the world to many things about the country, its battles and its victories.
History speaks of sport, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, an Oscar-winning American actor, embodies the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said, it was a Mandela aged ninety-one who asked him to embody him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded a prize for his role in Clint Eastwood's Milion Dollar Baby drama in boxing, for example, incarnated the leader of a movement against slavery that had become itself a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, even God in the film Evan Almighty but never someone still alive and as important to so many as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his hard work towards the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became President of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team François to unify the country. Newly elected President Mandela knows that his country still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He is convinced of being able to unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders in the world.
The South African team will eventually advance in the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's story to the big screen.
I had no other purpose but to play that role so as to bring it closer to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me was of course to talk like him.
The actor stated that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, dine with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I get your energy back, it transmits and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare for a role in the harsh middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a great surprise.
I remember when I rang at the door of the house, he opened me up and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, "I look a lot bigger in the movie."
Despite the differences between the actors and the real models, Invictus under the leadership of director Eastwood received positive opinions and we are even talking about ambitions for the Oscars.
The film critic Todd McCarthy from Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well-directed film."
In film evaluations on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive ratings.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only admitted yesterday that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic rocket not far from Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was still a failure and the Bulava missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is gradually becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly away, or she damaged herself in the middle of the flight.
Russian newspapers talk about "Bulava" as "missile that doesn't fly"
A missile that doesn't fly but shines
This 13th test was conducted at the beginning normally.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was further damage to the aircraft.
It was obviously the third-stage engine of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew away from the nuclear submarine Dmitrij Donskij who was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can just be fired on a moving boat and submerged
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava."
Moreover, the Norwegian did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we cannot speak absolutely of failure.
The first two stages of the rocket resisted and the damage only hit the third.
In previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first stage.
Although none of the test runs went smoothly, the Ministry of Defence management considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent therefore fills the generals with optimism and thus they always claim that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will carry even ten hypersonic nuclear nuclei with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed a one-year contract with the CSKA Moscow at 51 years of age
Legendary defenseman Viatcheslav Fetissov will be back in a professional match at 51.
Former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already in Friday's game against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuliash's injury we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to sort out some details on the form, says coach Sergey Nyemchinov, quoted by AP agency.
It has not been clarified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one game.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, said Nyemchinov.
According to AP, in the event of his return to the ice, Fetissov became the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In NHL, legendary attacker Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous fetisov quintet, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players.
Under the colours of the Soviet Union, he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven World Championship titles, and won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected tributes in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and canceled all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in Nošovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of frequent overtime that the unions declared an emergency strike on Monday.
Spokesman Petr Vaněk of the Hyundai plant confirmed this.
The management, however, wants to agree again with the unions on a Saturday worked again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was offered on Saturday 19 December knowing that there would be two teams, said Vaněk.
The Sedmička.cz website indicated that the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech kroner to the employees who would be part of the Saturday team.
It will also be awarded a posteriori for the day worked on 28 November.
The company, according to Vaněk, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the extra overtime supplement, or they can place a replacement leave on December 28 and extend their year-end holidays with Vaněk.
In addition to this all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and hottest point in the comments and claims of unions as well as employees who spontaneously ceased production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, said Vaněk.
Until last week, the workers of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The following negotiations between the management of the car factory and the unions are scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchao declared on Wednesday that they were ready to cease the state of strike if they agreed on their claims and signed a joint document.
The situation in the factory peaked last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to unceasing overtime.
They also protested against the poor wage and so-called hazing conditions.
Management defended the fact that employees had to work extra to meet car production requirements.
When the strike was announced on Monday, the unions also asked that employees who had ceased production should not be subject to any sanctions.
The unions ask the company to reduce the time spent in overtime to a minimum.
In addition, this year they want a fee of 5 000 kroner (about 209 €) for them.
The Hyundai car factory in Nošovice currently employs 2,000 people.
She started serial production last year in November.
It has manufactured about 80,000 vehicles until September of this year, having a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on HIV viruses "enduring" as well
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity to medicines.
This reality takes precedence, in some cases, over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, life can be radically extended through a mixture of medicines that prevent the spread of HIV in the body.
However, there are a number of side effects associated with their use.
Moreover, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing so-called resistant viruses on which the drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the VŠCHT of Prague and the University of Heidelberg, paves the way for dealing with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein that multiplies the HIV virus.
Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a way different from all the drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their binding on virus proteins.
Metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous, resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential to the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by HIV protease, there would be no mature infectious particles of the virus.
If we stop the protease of HIV, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases was tested in test tubes and on its resistant variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metalocarboranes is not as strong as on clinical drugs, but it does not weaken on resistant versions against which common drugs are often ineffective.
Metalocarborans, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of other chemical changes, are therefore interesting combinations that need to be further examined in order to develop effective HIV drugs, says Pavlína gamezáčová, director of the laboratory of structural biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
The ODS is attacking Fischer, who is defending himself.
The president of the ODS (Civic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolánek, described the budget ratified for the following year as "frightening" and, according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the SDO's remarks a drastic verdict.
He says he's taking time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Nečas said that the idea of an administrative firm supported by ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Nečas, the head of the government should decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies to support the minority who is concerned with combating the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Nečas warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for 2010, however with the proposed amendments of up to 12 billion kroons included by the left.
The House has increased money for civil servants' salaries, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's complaint about the Social Democrats' proposals was that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of DKr 163 billion.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's wish that a modified budget would be a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Deception and inefficiency
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will reflect again on the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota threatened to leave office if the proposed amendments were ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota made an appointment with the Prime Minister on Monday following his visit to the government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering if he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the negotiations on the budget is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue to fight the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD representatives, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other laws that increase the deficit, such as those relating to health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not involved.
This is the case of the head of the Fischer government and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by ODS have done nothing detrimental, Topolánek pointed out in a text statement from the United States.
He recalled that the deputy ministers of some ministries claimed to be TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the deficit of public finances, "it is entirely logical and correct that he should base himself on the left majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the democrats.
I have not thought about it and once it is on the agenda then I will devote myself to it, said from the Chamber to the journalists, Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew away in the afternoon for a European Council debate in Brussels.
ODS turned back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted against the amended budget on Wednesday if it had not specifically asked the Democratic Members to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had suffered criticism from the party president in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been missing.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a Bolshevisation of the House and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek reacted in person.
According to the new ČD schedules there will be fewer trains for identical rates.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit certain less loaded express or regional trains from 13 December and will strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will fall on the day of entry into force of the new timetables by two percent compared to today.
Most tariffs will not change, including basic and reduced rates.
It is for example the inhabitants of the Ostrava region who will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a train pendolino.
On the contrary, an express will stop serving Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be drastically reduced.
At the regional level, the biggest decrease in transport is in the region of Hradec Králové by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can welcome an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice line will be reduced to only a few days in the week.
Among the most important transformations is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: for the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, which can be opened thanks to the completion of electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague Main Station (Praha Hlavní nádraží).
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk / Jeseník will leave in two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for the regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
The express trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport and will pay the Railways next year a total of four billion kroons to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. The regional trains are ordered by the regions that will pay for them a total of eight billion next year, knowing that the state will participate to the tune of almost three billion.
This year the regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, so far the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which also explains why they did not raise the prices of the vast majority of transport tickets.
The changes will affect only ČD Net day tickets and internet tickets at reduced prices eLiška.
For travellers without discount cards, the price of ČD Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLiška will again depend on the route travelled, whereas until then it was valid between cities of a region of choice and was at a single price of 160 kroons.
Filipino rebels still hold more than 50 people, children have been released
The rebels have today abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed it, but spoke about the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, as well as one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that approximately 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during a flight from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to reach an agreement on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, the police initially prosecuted the kidnappers for violence caused by a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the southern Philippines because of a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the governor's administration elections were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippines province was arrested on suspicion of participation in the massacre, as was his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
Mindanao Island also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film arrives in American theatres in the coming days, the title is Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Neporažený), and narrates part of the life of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to incarnate it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was awarded to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in cinemas, the feedback from critics and the public is being heard.
Nelson Mandela
By his full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, he was born on June 18, 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for his freedom of thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds great hopes because it is presented at a time when South Africa is in the midst of preparations for the World Cup of Football, and because the media are agitated by disturbing news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants by the ruling black majority.
According to AP agency, reactions to the new film are for the moment quite positive in South Africa, despite frequent reservations about the main roles where Hollywood stars "paddle."
Morgan Freeman is, however, proud of the film by using his own terms.
I dreamt of this role for many years and prepared well.
I have also met Nelson Mandela personally on many occasions to be able - as they say - to recover his energy, he said at the official premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think it's a good thing if you can remember Mandela's personality and message through the film.
It is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns each individual, he added.
Wear the rugby national team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel of British writer John Carlin being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
So Morgan Freeman tries during the film to put together two racial groups from a long divided population and just like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he enters the national jersey of the South African team on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa won at the time.
For showing up on the lawn in jersey, which is considered in South Africa as something sacred, Mandela had been extensively ovated fourteen years ago mainly from the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in uniting people again into one nation, said Rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
The South African whites, however, are skeptical, as was recently reported in an interview with LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A processor worth tens of millions of burning crowns in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of Čeps from the distribution centre near the municipality of Výškov na Lounsku.
According to Lukáš Marvan, spokesman for the fire department in Ústí, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer burn, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the company spokesman Pavla Mandátova the incident does not endanger the safe functioning of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact figure can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandátova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity Čeps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electrical power supplies have not been interrupted, says ČEZ spokesperson for North Bohemia Sořa Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. Čeps is the exclusive operator on Czech territory of transmission systems and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from transmission sets to distribution sets and line tracks with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jančura to file defamation complaint against three ČSSD prefects
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will now file a defamation complaint against three Social Democratic Prefects.
And specifically against Michal Hašek of the South Moravia region, Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and the prefect of the Olomouc Martin Tesařík region.
Jančura indicated this in Dvacet minut de Radiožurnál.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
However, all regions ended up signing long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three of us have attacked and claimed that we are making the fine mouths, whereas we have only made an offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have left to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slander on Student Agency, said Jančura at Radiožurnál.
He also indicated that he had evidence that no region had proceeded in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint for the European Commission to do so.
Hašek considers that Mr. Jančura's filing of a complaint is the continuation of his media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company and for his person.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my name and the name of my region, and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to make it clear that it is precisely Mr Jančura who manipulates public opinion and uses false and misleading arguments about regional rail transport, says Hašek
Jančura has already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable approaches of the regions.
He told Radiožurnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he intended to resume it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign would focus on corruption in the broad sense.
Jančura started her campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of rail links for an order of approximately DKr 150 billion, without issuing a call for tenders.
According to Jančura, such action is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even led to threats in Jančura from a ČSSD MP.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licences.
He ran for the ČSSD, I don't know who it is, but I won't say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today.
Vaccination against pneumococci will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
There are already voices, saying that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The pharmaceutical institute has already set the maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance.
Specialists also see the immunization process as clear.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for August children.
Since January, children born last year from 2 August can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th months of the child's life.
Already last year a quarter of families have voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
Yet the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of younger children requires four doses.
The experts estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 kroons in doses of vaccine.
They do, however, save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would require.
Up to now, the State has spent about 500,000 kroner per year on all immunization of children.
The reimbursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package."
Pneumococci are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including inflammation of the meninges and poisonings of the blood.
According to hospital surveys, there are up to 28 deaths of children under 10 years of age due to pneumococcal infections.
Apart from the Czech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced the reimbursed vaccination.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
There are opinions regarding a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
From January, it must be regulated by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský association indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccination.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the experts were not really satisfied that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that needs to be taken now, said Kalovský.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumococci.
We do not think of it at all at the moment, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sršež.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Paediatrician Society, acknowledges that vaccination based on the wiletariata its defects.
If all children were vaccinated, one could consider a decrease in the renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making vaccination optional," said Cabrnochová.
Specialists expect that by next year, more than 80 per cent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also a break because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not by the State.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should free up funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their products themselves
This, however, is linked to the concerns of pediatricians who are practitioners, who are involved in the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other vaccine products provided by the state.
Some MEPs were concerned, however, that this would allow insurance to "deduct amounts from health insurance."
For example, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
It is estimated that pediatricians will have to invest approximately 40,000 kroons per month individually in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It won't be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "Museum Theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a recognized illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (GBP 12 million) in his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police reported that Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum in the Pocono Mountains area.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, reported the Associated Press (AP) news agency.
AP cited a police official who said that the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr. Frazetta Jr, 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," reported the agency.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denies having given such permission, said the agency.
Labour advocates an increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increase and spending cuts announced in the pre-budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, business and trade unions.
The Tories claimed that Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the elections.
The Chancellor has also striven to tackle low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals are a 0.5% increase in Social Insurance and a ceiling rate of 1% on public wages from 2011 onwards.
The Anger of Social Insurance
The unions protested that low wages were being penalised by a recession for which they were not responsible and warned that "problems" were coming.
The fall in Social Insurance - which will bring about around GBP 3 billion a year - has made the business world angry, as he says it is an employment tax when the objective should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than GBP 20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MAIN POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social insurance will increase further by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the 4.75% expected this year
New 50% tax on bankers' bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Tax rebates for electric cars and wind turbines
Increase in pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, one person earning GBP 30,000 per year will lose GBP 90 and one person earning GBP 40,000 per year will lose GBP 190, while one person earning GBP 10,000 per year will earn an additional GBP 110.
Ministers stated that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was "difficult decisions" but stressed that 60% of the additional tax burden would be borne by the first 5% of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary of the Treasury, refuted an increase in the tax and pointed out that a decrease in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, and they will allow us to divide the deficit by half, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that economic growth would resume at the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts of economic growth - which will affect the amount to be borrowed and the speed with which the deficit will be filled - were questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said that the economy would probably fall by 4.75% this year - much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - when the loan would be 3 billion GDP above the previous estimate.
"Missed opportunity" '
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning against the Labour's "debt crisis," said that the plan to borrow GBP 789 billion over the next six years was unsustainable.
Ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, evading "cynically" difficult choices until after the elections - scheduled to take place in June 2010.
"They presented nothing significant about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Treasury Secretary of the phantom cabinet. "They had the opportunity to do so and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, contrary to Tory's proposals, which would lead to a faster and greater reduction of the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through increased taxes and reduced spending would be used to support next year's spending and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans were "built on the wind."
Nick Robinson, BBC Political Editor, said that the calendar of announcements - such as the increase in inflation for some disability benefits next April, mentioned above - would leave the Chancellor faced with propaganda charges, the money being simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour stresses that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"Wrong budget"
Although ministers did not publish details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that restrictions on public spending would begin to be felt only in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies (Institut des Etudes Fiscales) has stated that the Chancellor's figures imply, in the future, substantial reductions in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is actually only postponed," said its Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important announcements will be made after the elections, regardless of the winner," added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte's accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report, and the markets are well aware of it."
FBI investigates "American arrests in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist ties.
The men were arrested during a raid at a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, announced the US embassy in Pakistan at the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The US Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are portrayed as of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are American citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are being held, "said spokesperson Ian Kelly.
Katherine Schweit, FBI spokesperson, said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are missing," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington claimed that the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of them's uncle.
She said that the house was already being monitored by the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused any comment on the arrests, reported Reuters news agency, but said that the United States should "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to uproot the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students had been reported missing from their homes by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns Iranian "abuses"
Over the past 20 years, human rights have been as little respected as ever, according to Amnesty International's report.
the report presents "repeated violations" by the regime, before and after the presidential election campaign in June.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticism of its failure to respect human rights.
The authorities have claimed that such criticism is politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad led to the largest public demonstrations since the Islamic revolution of 1979.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors state that at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, says our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International reported on the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of "Working with Facebook networks" and protested against the election results.
"They often hit me in the face," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in front of my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and he was released and left on the street, still in blood and half-conscious, said Amnesty.
In August, the losing candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape charges, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said that he had been locked in a container with 75 other persons, for more than eight weeks, in a detention centre in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary should establish a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response, but stated that the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and that the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said that at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The event Track in the Park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowborders to competition for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park Trail, a small springboard preceded a 100m long runway.
John Hickman, a fourth year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but quite intimidating.
It is a magnificent view, with all the lights of the city glittering down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowborders in the country - real talent, "he added.
Awards have rewarded the best voltists - or figures made on the track.
After Thursday night's party, the snow will be cast off.
Always them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted to this new book, admirers of the author's latest book, "Why the French do not like the headscarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study of a problem that has divided and preoccupied the country for some 15 years and whose effects are still being felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious frame.
A good anthropologist, he wanted to know not only what politicians and the media were saying about Islam in France, but what was currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m of Muslims.
He knows very well how to listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Does a Muslim have to marry in a mosque or in the city hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to obtain a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily lot, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
The intellectuals and activists who were interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally in agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia, which today make up a small part of the Muslims in Europe.
Mr Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wondered how committed French politicians (and the intellectual elite that kept secularism so virulent) were to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than growing pragmatism, it detects a "narrowness of key values."
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming speed, carrying with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are sailing in new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice," Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the great north, the polar bear.
Known for the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who were successful in hunting polar bears.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson, then brave 14-year-old aspirant who had to fight only the tip of his musket, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young cubs, captured while swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show brought together 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a millionth of the surface needed for an adult in freedom. The climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green due to algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often reviews the threat that hunters pose to species survival.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Inuit motoski Indians use powerful assault guns to hunt their game.
Ironically, ice will remain the longest in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating glimpse of what the future might be like there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheres nor oceanographers can accurately report the rate of change.
It's not for lack of trying.
At the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, Fridtjof Nansen's pioneering voyages provided the first information on the melting of the ice cap.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes below it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the Arctic ice-dependent system, formed by the freezing-pressed brackish water fillets.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of the summer ice, planned between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months, it may be our turn"
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on the graves in Arlington
First class De'Angello Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus trip to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this day was dedicated to saluting men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, said Robinson about the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I'd like someone to do the same for me, which is why I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of the 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay crowns on veterans' graves in various sections of the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony Cemetery.
Now, to continue a tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen travel every year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honour of the military and the victims of terrorism.
Worcester also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the graves of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the memorial for victims of United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation donated over $150,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, stated that she had made the trip to Arlington in honour of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband was not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way of thanking those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can do to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embedded in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extended hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers have chosen ancient tombs, dating from the First and Second World Wars, as well as from the Vietnam War, because they are not as often visited as the new tombs, said the organizers.
The mood was optimistic, as the children played and the couples stood by the hand, carrying the fresh pine crowns on the grey tombs.
Each round crown had a dark green colour, with a small red bow tie on the top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Individuals were crying without hiding, others were praying, and families and friends were supporting each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned over to see the small black and white information cards, pushed into the moist earth for those whose grave had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in tears, on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio, and drove eight hours to come and gather on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... my son paid for it, she said.
"Long after I've disappeared, I want someone to remember him."
An American national arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government arrested an American national who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, said the services of the United States Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The national, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., headquartered in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities and the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to access the detainee who was arrested on 5 December.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous."
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how husbands are and they are being followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but the permits have always been denied.
The detention of an American national may increase tensions between the Communist government of the brothers in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a "soft" approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new American policy insists that the Cuban government move forward in concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the United States can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and desired consumer goods in a country where the average salary of an official is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for text messages or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day's pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who wish to log in often have to communicate their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans incarcerated in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, Press Secretary to the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are a big mistake.
An activity that would be allowed in any other open society -- to distribute mobile phones free of charge -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas programme of the Human Rights Watch group, who recently published a harsh report on Cuban freedoms, called "New Castro, even Cuba," referring to the installation of Raul Castro as the country's leader to replace Fidel, his ill older brother.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provoked a negative reaction in the United States, as both countries began to engage in a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, the Pakistani authorities spotted an organization supposed to be planning a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill American troops, saying they were hoping that this case would disassemble a large network of terrorist recruiters who are scrambling the Internet for young radicalized men.
The investigators claimed that they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments endorsing the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
When they arrived in Pakistan, they were guided by Saifullah, who tried to help them reach the remote area of Pakistan's tribal belt, home of al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani secret service official who was informed of the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida commanders that these men were not participating in the CIA's conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the north-east, becoming a refuge for terrorism.
They were considered undercover agents.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who spoke on the condition that they remain anonymous because of the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary permits to enter al-Qa'idah camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- emphasize the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the priority of the United States secret services has been to infiltrate men into the al-Qa'idah network.
The recruiters of the organization act as barriers guards, denying entry to those who do not show a serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential American recruits are being closely studied by al-Qaida.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to American targets and their promotional value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert from the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups must also pay increasing attention in recent years to the choice of people they accept because the US secret services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern than so many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of Protestants in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of Protestants walked on the streets here on Saturday, calling for more action on the climate by negotiators working in the city's Bella Convention Center Congress Palace.
The number of demonstrators was estimated at 100,000, but according to police estimates, 25,000.
This event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists ignited a few explosives near a set of government buildings in the city centre.
On that day, when little happened during the climate talks sponsored by the United Nations, thousands of activists marched across the city, deploying signs in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, saying "The Earth says it has enough."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including the top Danish model and photographer, Helena Christensen, who said that travelling to her mother's native country, Peru, has opened her eyes to the daunting problems facing the country because of the impact of climate change that is already taking place. "
That's one of the reasons I decided to join the big march -- to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to make just, ambitious and committed decisions, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
The police prevented the demonstrators from coming too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or that they were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothes lit several explosives near the main channel of Copenhagen, which is surrounded by some ministries.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions."
Inside the Palais des Congrès, people were gathered around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators have failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as Su Wei, China's climate representative.
When asked if he thought that an event would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, "In fact, it's something I wasn't aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "The event being important, I cannot hear what is happening outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful depending on the outlook.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt the negotiations or harm the freedom of others."
The results of the tests reveal persistent differences between the races.
Last week's federal report on results in mathematics brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District is still far behind the leading institutions, the report shows that Grades 4 and 5 (cm1-cm2) are far more advanced in the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress show the persistent gap between the performance of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of white children from Grade 4 (cm1) to Washington D.C. have increased over the past two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have increased by only three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in success actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 points to 58 points.
The progress of African-Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, falling by only one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white result was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overview over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between Black and White in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262-202).
Although the results obtained by children in both groups increased during this period, the difference was reduced to only 58 points.
Last week, some advocates in the District expressed concern that the rise celebrated by the group director Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), was driven by the white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in District education.
I do not jump for one or two points, said Kwame R. Brown (Democratic related), a member of the D.C. Council whose daughter is in Grade 4 in Eaton Elementary (elementary school).
Often critical of Rhee's management style, Brown said the message of test results is that the city's middle schools are desperately in need of attention.
Really, you still want to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But what's scary is that we don't devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee stated that the District must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the elementary and junior grades who did not integrate the basics of reading earlier in their school career and are quite behind their peers.
Every day, the mathematics program, for Kindergarten (kindergarten) classes at Grade 6 (6th), focuses on the games and experiences of real life, as set up in the District by former leader Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we need to keep working to offer better interventions to those students below the class level, "said Rhee.
Others believe that the NAEP results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall performance of the system while providing money and resources for schools with less good results in order to narrow the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, "said Bruce Fuller, a teacher trainer at the University of Berkeley, California, who is studying the results of city tests.
The conventional political solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools in Washington's poorest neighbourhoods.
As a result, such targeting can have political implications that hinder this important agenda.
But the problem, of course, is that like other school superintendents, she tries to use the middle class of white and black people.
We are concentrating on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they come from, are assured that their children will be able to obtain excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements in narrowing the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to compete with the Charter schools.
It takes about 200 days to get the strength to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, that he considers a "starting point" to get another increase in the next contract.
Making higher education a promise for the future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, descends and blends for a moment with the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela's parents were only able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students of the group explored Gettysburg where tuition is $38,690 per year, her attitude was less that of an impressed but enthusiastic new student.
Super That's where I'm going to study! Graciela exclaimed who would like to study medicine, as the guide directed them to the entrance of the science building.
Yupi, really? she said, when she was told the low ratio of law professor to student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still largely arises for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "a" second generation "Hispanic out of five continues to study in high school -- a notable achievement considering that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, have entered the United States without completing high school.
Their success is important, say researchers, they pave the way for future generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
Researchers who study the wings claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many parents also set high targets for their children and found ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her to reach university -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to the universities of Graciela is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare yourself), it provides over $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university readiness programs that begin when students from low-income families are in middle school and continue through high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been attended by more than 10 million students, with over 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry gets agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract large oil companies to rebuild its infrastructure in difficulty during two auctions that ended on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Iraqi Oil Ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that the oil companies of China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the rehabilitation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
The US companies left with a stake in only two of the 10 fields being auctioned.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put in an auction lost.
Two American companies were awarded contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of US oil giants in the opening up of Iraq's oil sector surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an information website on the Internet.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as US military troops retreated, have hampered US oil companies, preventing them from entering more forcefully into Iraq, which has the third largest crude oil reserve in the world, say analysts.
American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged by their rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they were not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
The largest American companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintained strong ties with and provided technical advice to the Iraqi Ministry of Oil, left empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has bid more on contracts than other companies and is part-time with significant holdings in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, "said Assam Jihad, spokesman for the Ministry of Oil.
We are confident that Chinese society will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to bid made bids that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of the main organizers of al-Qa'idah was reportedly killed in Pakistan
It appears that an American missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda operations this week, said American counter-intelligence authorities on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles thrown into their car on Tuesday near Miran Shah, North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities claimed that the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA, inside Pakistan's anarchic tribal border.
They were driving a white car, heading towards the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said a Pakistani civilian secret service member speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Representatives of the authority said that local suspected militants rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained "totally shredded bodies."
It was completely impossible for the local authorities to verify the identity of the victims, but the two US anti-terrorist representatives gave unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the Al-Qaida military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
His role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of air strikes inside Pakistan.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracy of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic direction of al-Qa'idah leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second representative of the American authority said that Somali had made rapid progress in al-Qaeda's ranks and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but it does not diminish its threat to us and our allies, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major figure of al-Qaida or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The rate of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures from the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a non-profit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, says the site.
UN Special Envoy to Kabul withdraws
The United Nations Special Envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, declared on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, following a tumultuous mandate full of allegations of widespread corruption during the United Nations-supported presidential elections.
Eide's departure comes at a time when the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported this increase but expressed concern about the US timetable for a withdrawal of troops that would start in 18 months and force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants assisting the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide stated that he was not quitting but would simply honour his commitment to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that he has time to find a replacement.
I just said it was best to start looking for my replacement, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to United Nations representatives, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
The representatives stated that the name of Staffan di Mistura had been cited; it was an Italian-Swiss citizen who had recently chaired a United Nations mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who had previously led United Nations peacekeeping operations.
Eide's reputation in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations, but stated that Galbraith's accusations -- which was thanked -- "were detrimental to the mission because there was already a good deal of skepticism about international election observation."
Eide stated that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the United States forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries than was attributed to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed frustration about the limitations of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the United Nations' heavy hiring regulations hampered its ability to bring new talent.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defence Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the major world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a square of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier's question about the possibility of such an outcome.
One of the things that weighs most on me is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the last six years, it is the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has pointed out that some of these sanctions could also affect street Iranians.
He said that a "package of motivations and punishments" might be necessary to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact be in poorer security with nuclear weapons "because" its people would suffer enormously 'from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "likely" consequences if it does not bring back its nuclear programme in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experience solely for peaceful purposes.
At the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume the dialogue on the reduction of his nuclear programme and agreed to abandon a significant part of his stockpile of enriched uranium, in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have moved away from attempts to reach agreement - in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's stiffness in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually agreed at the beginning of October prompted the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join together on what they had not envisaged, in terms of additional significant sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates.
President Obama set 31 December as the deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before he turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "increased sanctions."
In a statement made on Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it calls "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and affirmed its agreement to continue talks with the United States and five other major world powers, "in order to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution."
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet the Troop Leaders in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income-sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict in order to avoid any delays in the US plans to reduce the number of US troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also wants to calm the Kurds' anxiety about the pending withdrawal. US authorities quoted Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, President of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy in a unified Iraq."
We will not abandon you. "
In ageing China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by a poster of propagandists sermonizing them, "The Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave."
They learned the lesson so well that the authorities of the Shanghai Government, alarmed by the insufficient birth rate of their city and the ageing population, radically changed their direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources, who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the One Child Policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good and spoiled cheeks, nicknamed "small emperors," a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the United Nations, the average birth rate fell from 1.8 children per couple to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent in 2050, is well above the overall average of about 20 per cent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 per cent of the resident population registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission) said that fertile couples must have babies in order "to help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and prevent a shortage of labour in the future."
Shanghai is about to become "as old - but not as rich, however - as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
Gradual mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's single child policy is, to date, undoubtedly the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and suffer discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities had assigned the duty to the police to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers had denounced abuses in the implementation of that policy.
In rural areas, some government officials forced pregnant women from a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high ratio of boys to girls.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where men and women are already unique children -- and in 2007, they softened many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said that central government authorities have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
Within no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at their homes and drag leaflets under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the family planning officer, the response was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural suburb of Shanghai say they saw an increase in requests for couples' files seeking a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, Head of the Family Planning Committee in the municipality of Caolu, Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and that they are legally allowed to have two children.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners wrongly consider the one-child policy a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple's first child.
That's right, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Head of Human Resources, said she wanted only one child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and used to have everyone take care of us."
We are not used to taking care of someone else and we really do not want to take care of others. "
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company says so crudely.
For middle-class couples working with each other, who lower the birth rate, he says, one must be selfish to succeed.
People aged 20 or 30 grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and do not want to have this lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even one child takes a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his résumé to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, says Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to enjoy a higher standard of living, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has draft emission reduction plans
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under the spotlight on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the next few years.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as far as it informed the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that are running out of time, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by an ad hoc United Nations working group, the text did not say how rich countries would give the poor to cope with global warming, both in the short and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how new developed and emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature increase that those responsible would be prepared to tolerate.
It gives the process great flexibility, said John Coequyt, Representative in Washington of the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the paper, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN Executive Secretary-General on Climate Change, Yvo de Boer, described as "the complete picture."
It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce emissions by 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent of 1990 levels, while major developing countries, over the same period, would reduce emissions by 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion per year over the next three years to help the poorest countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
On Friday, however, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
Todd Stern, United States Climate Negotiation Representative, rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is getting harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of the major developing countries, said Stern, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that reductions could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the US chief negotiator, either lacked "common sense," or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the US would not help China financially to combat global warming.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the Third World and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about rescuing individual economies than rescuing the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives of taking more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers were struggling to find out who should bear the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even if vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold large emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for Conservation International.
Some of these countries that are more vulnerable to the impact of climate change have indicated that they will continue to press for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the main participants say that the negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Insular States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty proposal early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, Head of Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island states "put political pressure on the complete political process," in part by what they are now unified and that they are asking emerging economies such as China and India to act.
The discussions became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the outstanding issues before the Heads of Government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of the Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister came down from their aircraft and rushed to the Bella Center building to attend closed meetings and information conferences, in order to be able to make claims that will be investigated in the following week.
The real image of the gathering -- in which 13,000 people enter and leave the Palais des Congrès every day -- guitar players present night shows mocking the countries they think are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by e-mail -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all the important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the heart of the great, "said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for Global Conservation Policy International.
The trucks are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km / h will redefine Monday's syndrome
At 5: 13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed commuter train will reach 225 km / h, as it will fly from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hoped that the new service would enable Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The small holes lost will become thriving suburban cities, business travel times will be much shorter, and the transition from aircraft and car to train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the £10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental dangers could put a brake on British high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its paper to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow him to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five metres of the urban area and sites where environmental impacts can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also expected that HS2 will offer three options for a larger, northbound high-speed network.
Lord Adonis will answer in spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration where a high-speed line runs to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines in Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast towards Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It seems to be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this is over, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a one-hour trip currently.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km / h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and capable of carrying 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a London - Birmingham line.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be required.
Given the space constraints, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail industry experts state that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be put in place, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to travel off high-speed lines on existing tracks north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland longer than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, which is a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Reimburse GBP 75,000 Loan for Tory Orangerie
Alan Duncan, the principal member of the Tory Parliament, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his constituency home.
The party leader who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that the members of parliament were "being maintained," increased his loan by GBP 75,000 to build an oak extension at his second home in Rutland.
He had been authorized to charge the taxpayer the additional interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month.
The Commons' authorities received the complaints at that time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carried out a monitoring of members' expenses. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler."
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his riding of Rutland - Melton.
The surrounding houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the emoluments office states that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbours describe it as a "veranda for pleasure."
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons Committee on Privileges and Standards regarding its pre-borrowing provisions.
The Committee cleared him last month of any charges of non-compliance, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal certainty of his London property's GBP 271,406 loan to his constituency home, which he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of Parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately GBP 1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March of last year.
In April, its applications increased by more than GBP 1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was not changed at that time, suggesting that all the increases were intended to finance the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard variable RBS interest rate rose from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, without moving since then.
The latest publication by the Commons' authorities shows that Duncan continued to apply for GBP 1,250 in May.
Mr. Duncan lost his position as Head of the phantom cabinet in September, after an undercover journalist allegedly filmed him saying that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the expenditure scandal.
"In fact, it is now national, you have to live" on budget "and you are treated as" of the m... e "
He said, "I spent my money on my garden and I asked for a small part, based on what was right.
and I could have asked a hell of a lot more, but I didn't. "
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil trader, began to have to explain his expenses in May, after it became clear that he had asked thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expenses office that this "could be considered excessive."
An activist dug a pound-shaped hole in Mr. Duncan's lawn, protesting after it was revealed that he had requested GBP 4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved by both the fees office and Legg."
He added: "There is no problem with derogating or developing or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, allowed, etc.
It could not be clearer or simpler. "
Faithful, come and see the Brighton Advent calendar
Brighton beach cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cabins for each December day, using Christmas songs as a theme.
The event began on December 1, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5: 30 p.m. to 6: 30 p.m. each day, with pâtés and hot wine served free of charge.
Christmas songs chosen to date include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël," for which the booth presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is an unpaid priest from the diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: "We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christianity society.
"As a Church, why do we wait for people to enter a strange old building? It seems to me that the Church should come closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the beach cabin Advent calendar came right after a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experiment and represent it through spirituality. "
Strong climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where the police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, some hundred thousand, according to the organisers, marched in the cold in the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations Climate Conference, charged with reaching an agreement by Friday that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish President of the Climate Conference, the growing climate mobilization around the world, illustrated by these events, has helped to make the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the procession left, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, broke windows with cobblestones and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Riot-fighting police immediately intervened untiring.
In total, the police announced the arrest of between 600 and 700 people, mainly according to them of members of the "Blacks Bloks," these ultra-violent groups, which had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were arrested "without distinction," pointing out that about 100 of them "were always held in the street Saturday night" handcuffed and held in a sitting position despite the extreme cold. "
The procession, a rather good child, left Parliament and took over the Bella Center, the site of negotiations.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators had come by bus and train from Europe's big cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in raincoat blue, had formed a first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today, we are going down the streets to seek compensation for the environmental debt in favour of the South, "said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can't keep thinking: we have time, said Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like you've never done before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alterglobalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure in alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice": "today there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, launched the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, marched in red, wearing bandanas proclaiming solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators also called for strong action against climate change.
In France, events organised by the 350 network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
The separatist Abkhazia elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounced a "farce."
Some 131,000 people were expected to participate in this first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for the control of South Ossetia, another secessionist Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 1700 GMT.
The turnout was 58 per cent a few hours before the closure, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first provisional results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the outgoing president, Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
These elections are a joke.
For his part, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has fallen under the total occupation of Russia," said his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which claimed several thousand lives, Abkhazia seeks to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a step in our new life, our new era as an independent state, told AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Mr Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station at a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a nice white building with some palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential process in this region with sumptuous landscapes on the edge of the Black Sea.
Large panels showing Mr Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are installed throughout this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, the district leader, Beslan Archba, extended a warm welcome to Russian officials who had come to monitor the voting process.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said in a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, by raising a glass of vodka.
For its part, the opposition represented in the ballot by former Vice-President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements concluded with Moscow last year, such as the one giving control over the Abkhaz railways to Russia for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: events around the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, on the bright side, arrested nearly 700 people on the sidelines of a massive demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand, according to the organizers, marched in the cold in the afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, in search of an agreement that will enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From the Parliament, the procession, which was generally a good child, took over the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre, without attempting to enter it.
A stage had been set up to welcome the speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the procession left, a group of a few hundred demonstrators, dressed entirely in black, with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist said.
Riot-fighting police immediately surrounded them and intervened unruly, throwing several of them ashore.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks," these ultra-violent groups, which had notably illustrated themselves at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat in incidents that led to the arrest of some 20 people, according to the police.
We are watching extremist groups, as police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, while law enforcement helicopters were spinning in the sky.
The majority of the demonstrators, coming by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in raincoat blue, had formed a first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "climate justice."
Today, we are going down the streets to seek compensation for the environmental debt in favour of the South, "said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate and social justice": "today there is no cut between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN Refugee Commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, launched the demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, demonstrated, dressed in red and wearing bandanas that boast solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, gatherings of a few hundred demonstrators were also held to demand action against climate change.
In France, events organised by the 350 network brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva a few dozen people gathered.
Geo-history comes out of the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
Minister of National Education Luc Chatel stated in an interview to be published in the JDD on Sunday that history and geography emerged "strengthened" from the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory education as a scientific graduate.
From now on, first-year students will all have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, says Chatel.
For the minister, "we must get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S-track is no longer a scientific track," but "basically, it concentrates on the best students."
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-branches of the S, he continues, stressing again: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals indignant about the absence of history-geography in the upper secondary schools of technology."
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L'Humanité revealed that nearly seven in ten French people (69%) disapproved of the government's plan to abolish compulsory education from history-geography at the end of the term S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some elected on the right.
On the other hand, the Minister added that it was "no question" to remove the philosophy of the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of teacher training, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization on Tuesday to protest against the project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will take an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admission test that will focus on their ability to teach, said the Minister.
They will also take placements in the M2 year and will be a first year in front of the students as trainee teachers.
If you add up all the courses offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, which is more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister said that he would propose "the individual right to training, something which does not exist in national education."
It also reaffirms the plan to delete the school card "by 2012."
In Normal Sub, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to discuss the issues at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ecole Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize winner, opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day of 15 minutes each of expert speeches, filmed and open to the public, found an AFP journalist.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the margins of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from that given by the students to the fish in the school pool.
Some 20 speakers were selected from among the experts in their disciplines and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
On the subject of global warming, "we can talk about hours, but we can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said AFP Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but with the help of graphs, in front of about 50 people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping that listeners will consider that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record."
Videos from these lectures will be posted on the school website as of December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bimonthly pace.
Late payments: anger of prison guards, planned actions
On Friday, the unions of prison supervisors called for a "general mobilization" to demand payment by the end of the year of bonuses and overtime which were delayed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Union of Supervisors) asked staff who will not be on duty to demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of the penal institutions and to "block them," in order to "denounce the theft of their due."
The CGT-Penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls on them to "meet in general assemblies in the various prisons for a strong mobilization," considering "shameful and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of "overtime, night bonuses, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of supervisors, the Autonomous Federal Prison Union (Ufap / Unsa), "calls for the general mobilization (...) to bring back discontent and anger."
The Directorate of Corrections and the Ministry of Justice explained that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were budgeted, but assured that the balance would be paid in January.
The Chancellery stated at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts made by the staff to operate and modernize our penitentiary system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I have asked the prison management to put in place without delay a set of measures to ensure that this situation, which is the result of a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours, does not recur in the future, says Alliot-Marie.
The pay for December will therefore be meagre, except for the management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, Ufap / Unsa deplored, for whom "budgetary constraints are good."
It is a pure scandal, outraged the interregional union FO of Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott until further notice "all meetings and convocations."
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those of October are not regularized in December, same for overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the money of the staff, the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux believes.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less poorly placed than others.
But in any case the account is not there, noted the Secretary General of the Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he's offering "nicer things" than the ones he gets.
American President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas with his family at the White House, told Oprah Winfrey's grandpa that he had a simple rule about gifts: "I give things that are nicer than the ones I get."
As part of a special show that will be broadcast Sunday night on ABC, President and his wife Michelle offer an overview of how they intend to celebrate the end-of-year celebrations in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be in the game.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama went against her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: "Certainly not, I gave you nice gifts last year," she teased the president.
Absolutely, was he forced to concede before replying with humour by pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?."
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous animator who was a strong supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember that time when I met my father who came to see us for Christmas and gave me a basketball, said the president.
It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me that ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her doll house.
I really didn't know how to organize a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging it around the fireplace, but I loved this little doll house, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperated, RTL claims he's in artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was reoperated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was reoperated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the disc hernia suffered in Paris on 26 November, according to his press service in Paris, stating that these injuries "required a restorative operation."
The singer's press service, however, wanted to reassure himself that the situation was "under control," while announcing that a new medical report would be issued no later than 48 hours from now.
According to RTL, partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was, however, plunged into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
It's only 48 hours from now that we'll have a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opens an eye, RTL adds.
When questioned by AFP, the press service did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also states that "according to some sources" no drain was laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated at the international clinic of Parc Monceau for this disc hernia.
The procedure, which had been scheduled for several days, had been performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a doctor well known in the arts.
This one was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following his surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close relative of Johnny Hallyday, thought on RTL Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but assured him that he was not "worried" about the rocker, who is "a fighter."
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because flying twelve hours after an operation like that is not playable, "said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself that Johnny Hallyday was "responding satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "contained."
Mr. Camus also said that he had met with Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the surprise of the general public, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on with a "small colon cancer," then with a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66," presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer's difficulties in travelling on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even denied a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009 / small basin: the first of Bousquet on its fetiche distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time World Cup medallist in the big pool, won an international title on Thursday over a distance that he particularly loves, the 50 m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in the small pool in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition, where combinations are allowed for the last time, saw only three world records beaten as we were waiting for a surge.
One has been improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 200 m 4 nages and the other two by Russia in relay men 4x50 m 4 nages.
A regret for Bousquet, who lamented on the world record of the 50 m freestyle, whose mark he holds in large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the free 50 m, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who won in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better, and in this case, I said that if the world record were within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were dressed in polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
At the origin of 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations finish their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of the combinations was not used this time by the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the big pool this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer did not succeed in lowering his mark to 400 m free swimming (3: 32.77) but nevertheless won the second best time of his career (3: 34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3: 35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3: 36.82).
I didn't give a damn about this race.
I knew I couldn't beat a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and did my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, explained Biedermann.
USA: Sarcophagus panel owned by Zola awarded USD 1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging in particular to the French writer Emile Zola was awarded Thursday 1.5 million dollars, clearly above his estimate, announced art dealer Sotheby s.
This front panel, two metres long and 63 cm high, dating back to the 3rd century after Jesus Christ, was estimated to be between 150,000 and 250,000 dollars.
The marble "depicting four dionysiac scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyres and bacchants, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," explained to the AFP on Tuesday Florent Heintz, vice president of the art auctions of Roman and Egyptian antiquity at Sotheby.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still underway but this lot is certainly the one on which the buyers have bid the most so far, told AFP a spokesperson of Sotheby's, Dan Abernethy.
The discovery of Emile Zola's acquisition of this marble dates back a few days.
The panel remained almost 300 years in Rome in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of his bathtub in his Parisian private hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power of Marshal Pétain.
Remaining a shadow zone of about fifty years.
While searching the Louvre Museum database, Florent Heintz discovered that this sign was part of a "succession Emile Zola" opened in 1903, one year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco of "Rougon-Macquart."
Attempted aborted departure from Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico considered that conditions were no longer in place for the transfer to its territory of the fallen President of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused a safe conduct by the putschist government.
For the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not met, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arrived Wednesday in El Salvador to bring Mr. Zelaya back, the Mexican government plane returned to its place of origin, according to a source from the Directorate General of Migration.
The putschist government tried to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and apply for political asylum abroad to grant him a safe conduct.
But the fallen president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The putschist government "failed again by wanting me to relinquish (...), they wanted me to resign," said Zelaya on Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the five-month political crisis in Central America.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added by playing some chords the fallen president, refugee at the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The Mexican embassy has made a request for a safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, the minister of the interior of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, said Wednesday on Honduran radio.
I do not seek asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to be made as President of the Honduran people, he stressed.
The rumours of Mr. Zelaya's departure had mobilized supporters of the fallen president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military strengthened their headquarters.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the position of the putschist government.
This demonstrates the marginal nature of this government vis-à-vis international standards, he said.
Zelaya, who had moved closer to Venezuelan socialist president Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on 28 June, the day he had organized a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on 21 September and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested for the crime of "high treason" which he is accused of, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on 29 November to replace Mr Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial United States-recognized election but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Mr. Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term of office on 27 January.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday, with the US trade balance showing the recovery of both the US and its partners: the Dow Jones earned 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq advanced from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was 0.58% (6.40 points) at 1.102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she said, considering that the market was focused on "half-full glass."
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focused on the US trade balance figures, "which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter."
The US trade deficit decreased in October by 7.6% from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected a widening deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for exports of goods, which reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com., "The growth in the volume of trade in goods reflects the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States."
On the other hand, new registrations to unemployment in the United States increased against all odds last week, reaching 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers "has fallen to the lowest in the last year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The performance of the 10-year Treasury bill increased to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday night and that of the 30-year-old bond to 4.492% from 4.408% the previous day.
Cuba: Hundreds of Supporters of Power Conscience "Ladies in White" · Global Voices
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government conspired on Thursday with the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about ten dissidents were arrested.
Some 40 "Dames en blanc," wives or relatives of political prisoners, were consoled in the streets by supporters of the government of Raul Castro as they walked towards the centre of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist from AFP said.
Down with the Yankees!, "mercenaries!," "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!," "Long live Fidel and Raul!" chanted, fist up, supporters of power to dissidents.
The latter were escorted by plainclothes agents who came to "protect them."
The previous day, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Dames en blanche" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana district of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day were arrested by plain-clothes police officers, found an AFP journalist.
The police forced dissidents into civilian vehicles who were consoled by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
Interpellations of dissidents in similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
The 2005 Sakharov Prize recipients of the European Parliament, the "Ladies in White" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners," according to the dissent, 200 of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is a member of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain under arrest.
The Cuban authorities regard opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" at the expense of their declared enemy, the United States.
On a rare occasion, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including expression.
A force killed an octogenarian with a knife and wounded 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A force armed with two knives killed an octogenarian and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), at one hour's inflow on Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck an octogenarian with two knives and for unknown reasons, in or in front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, it was learned from police sources and from witnesses.
Seriously wounded, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then attacked a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The husband, some thirty years old, interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenarian died.
The other man's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became ill and was said to have been hospitalized "in shock," according to a police source.
The armed man, who seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, again Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently at random: a thirty-year-old and a quadragenarian, the latter seriously.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried on a cross behind his back, explained on the spot an official of the Alliance union in the Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the force.
I saw a 30-year-old guy wearing a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn't make it because the guy was strong, said Alberto, waiter of a nearby bar.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal policeman who broke his wrist, he added.
Also on Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their official, attempted to arrest the armed man and were wounded by fists, according to police sources.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Some passers-by came by to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put her in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later arrived a second person in his thirties, wounded with a knife.
It was National Police personnel who arrested the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office referred the case to the department of the judicial police of the Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The force was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in custody.
A police source did not rule out his detention in a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to master him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitation" like "all the forces of this species whose forces increase under the effect of action."
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls again for prosecution to be dropped
The lawyer for French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski called again on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) for the abandonment of the lawsuit against his client, currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a moral case over 30 years old.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the "Pianiste," complained to three judges of the Court of Appeal of the second district of California about serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
I call for the charges to be dropped here and now, said Mr Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband -- who has since passed away -- would have been discussing, before sentencing, with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be imprisoned -- a serious procedural error.
This discussion was revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired," from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to abandon the proceedings, Mr. Hummel requested a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously investigated until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence was pronounced, for "illegal sex" with a 13-year-old girl.
He's never set foot in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney Phyllis Asayama stated that Roman Polanski "must be here to appear at the hearing."
In this case, is it intended to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to flee?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "asks for a favor from the court, while despising his authority."
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to render their decision -- also pointed out that "there are other alternatives to flight."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one who requested that the charges against Roman Polanski be dropped.
Samantha Geimer's lawyer, the victim, also called, once again, for an end to the prosecution.
Recalling that her client can no longer stand being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough. "
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland on an American arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was placed under house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, restrained by the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended up without direction on Friday, in a market pulled between better indicators than expected in the United States and the rise of the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index rose by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, noted Mace Blicksilver, from Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains within narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped to improve market opinion on the soundness of the economic recovery," summarized Charles Schwab's analysts.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
U.S. consumer confidence also recovered significantly in December, at 73.4 compared to 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices have been restrained by a further rise in the dollar, at the highest level in two months against the euro, which "pushes down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bill increased to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year-old bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the previous day.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of travel across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great mass of beauty organized for the second consecutive year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their tickets for the semifinal.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss sportsman or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
I have seen many things and lived so many experiences!, exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, is broadcast on Saturday live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 17h00 (15h00 GMT).
I couldn't dream of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I am happy to have lived it twice, points out Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country."
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and presented at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both of whom became Bollorian stars.
It's every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it's not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, says Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will punctuate this 59th edition.
The candidates will march in traditional costume and of course in swimsuits.
The show will be moderated by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a leader of the Miss World Steve Douglas committee.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with warmth and pride that is difficult to match, says Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates did like last year make a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
Exceptionally, they also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their best memory will no doubt remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup of Football, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been with people I never thought I could get near.
I will no doubt return for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiasm Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "are very positive," says his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," assured his son David on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport where he had to go to the bedside of his father hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, it is going very well, told the press David Hallyday when he left the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 13h00 local (21h00 GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, assured that he was going "very quickly" to the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection following the operation of a disc hernia on 26 November in Paris.
The singer had to be reoperated during the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this surgery.
His wife Laeticia went to the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade was educated, to attend a school show, found a photographer from AFP.
The Chief of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery of the Hospital of Mercy-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday in Los Angeles.
The producer fiercely challenged Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who performed the singer on 26 November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, said Mr. Camus.
I have heard of a possible future judicial procedure, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus considered that Johnny Hallyday had "gone far too fast to Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem with this trip and it amazed me, as I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Shortly before on RTL, he had indicated that the singer was apparently "gone without drain, without anything," after his Parisian operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic world.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he practised at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to solve a hematoma following a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a sulfurous reputation, condemned several times by the courts, in cases of medical liability, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" regularly prosecuted "before the Council of Order, and who is" far from being advisable. "
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke on Friday through his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He indicated that the intervention was "perfectly well done" and that the post-operative examinations were "normal."
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require the laying of a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer's tour, whose health problems have increased since this summer, seems to be in parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on 8 January (in Amiens, ndlr), as planned, seems very short, said Mr Camus.
The association UDF raises the tone and summon the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted on Friday to the attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to OPA on the acronym of the former Giscardian party, ordering him not to use it in any medium, under penalty of legal proceedings.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to recover the UDF acronym, considering that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political heritage after reaching out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his approach, he received the support of Hervé de Charette (former UMP at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trademark for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But on Friday evening, the office of the association UDF, controlled by François Bayrou's friends who do not intend to be dispossessed, came out of its silence to issue a demand to the minister and the deputy, ordering them not to use the acronym anymore and to pass on to them the property of the mark, under penalty of legal proceedings.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements that you are going to propose to your political movement of + take over + the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Centrist Alliance.
You also thought it would be good to send the name of this movement, the + New Center + of the slogan + the UDF of today +, on your militant material and on the page of your website, to note the signatories of the mail.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the office of the UDF which instructs the NC to "immediately withdraw the mention of the name of the UDF from any medium as well as from (sound) website."
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transmit the property of the mark to its rightful assignees."
If you did not do so, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of the members of the UDF, warn the signatories.
In their letters, they stated that the UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978" and recalled that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP."
In their view, therefore, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 voted to join the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the mark," he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years," but of the UMP.
He took disgraceful and fraudulent advantage of the absence of deposit of the acronym UDF to carry it out on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironising on the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for itself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which we are not entitled."
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt accuses him, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenarian to strip her of part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by up to three years' imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are torn apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegially by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office at the time of the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report by 10 March 2010, including whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she'll submit to it.
I will tell him about it, said at the end of the hearing Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman.
For his part, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) Expertise will show that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady who needs to be protected, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has been suing François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist-at-all, for having used her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers to be a long-time friend.
While the court was to consider the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' action, the lawyers' pleadings sometimes turned to a big family deballage on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer referred to three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I've never been able to talk to her since she was married. "
For her part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office again held that the complainant was not admissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge had refused in recent days to grant her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full legal capacity, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place, "said the representative of the Public Prosecutor's Office, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of large French companies, our fight for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile...
For more than ten years, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees has been reminiscent of the position of companies vis-à-vis consumers before the marketing revolution: it is a matter of getting employees to adhere to "values" determined from above as it used to be, of imposing on consumers products conceived by the technicians of the factory.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets back on the spot... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preferences regularly returns!
Demoralization of employees can lead to mortifying demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects managers in particular.
This demobilization seriously jeopardizes the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R & D and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
EI "demands a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision from all stakeholders..." and requires a commitment on the part of employees, which authoritarian management revenues completely frustrate.
That is why we call for a management revolution that would put employees at the centre of the company's concerns as well as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys
Will internal opinion surveys - such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees - encourage this revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally comes, after many detours, to do first... what it has always done.!
- Then, because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour.
From the great engineering schools, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, out of intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the commitment of managers, a recent Ipsos survey published in Le Figaro.fr helps the leaders in a position of mechanistic governance, not adapted to today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalist view of human behaviour.
It consists of incorporating a fundamental observation into any governance reasoning or practice: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly seen as a means of achieving part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only studies from Motifunctional Analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them in order to carry out their life projects.
Through the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business managers can monitor, anticipate and anticipate their "social performance" and return their human resources management "to the place."
In this way, they create a favourable ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Praise on the Right to Obama
On Friday, the American right welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo the day before, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who embroidered the award to Obama on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, a former vice-president candidate in the 2008 elections.
I liked what he said, "said Palin, a member of the right wing of the Republican party, to the daily USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the subject of war" sometimes necessary "in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
These terrorists must be arrested all over the country, she said.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich, felt that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I found the speech really very good, welcomed the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential statement.
On some sides, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed during the radio show "The Takeaway."
The former elected member, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen "a left-wing president" remind Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free and would not be able to give a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former pen of George W. Bush, reconverted columnist at the Washington Post, Obama gave "a very American speech."
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does," "he spoke like an American president," reminding Europeans "that they live in a safety bubble that they have not created and that they do not do much to preserve it," Gerson said.
Among the few on the right not to be convinced, a Bush-era falcon, former UN Ambassador John Bolton, described the speech as "dull, muddled and uninspired" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the President, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich alarmed that Barack Obama justified the use of force.
When we wrap war in the notion of justice, we can easily justify the killing of innocent people, he warned.
The centre-left press, however, continued to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to believe that the Nobel was prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, described his speech as "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech "should serve as a road map to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily.
Obama "gave the right speech," the New York Times said, judging him "both dark and edifying."
Roads: three marathons for an agreement that saves Christmas supplies
After three sessions of negotiations-marathon, the road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organisation to have stayed to the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the slogan of strike and the threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed this agreement, after several negotiating sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators had left in the early morning of Friday, hoping to sign the agreement text quickly at the end of the morning.
Even though three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had slapped the door.
But it took even more than six hours of a meeting started at 11: 00 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 6: 00 p.m. the text was signed.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "there was a fear that it would disrupt the end-of-year holidays," Mr. Bussereau said.
The text provides for an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
In hourly rates, for low-wage earners, "from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we're going a long way, "said Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we're going to order our militants that there are no blockages, no blockades from the refuelling centres.
But we can still have some recalcitrant people who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed "a good deal," although it was "difficult to concede increases on high wages given the international competition."
According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) referred to "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of general road transport conditions in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible, inter alia, to address the issue of a 13th month and a modernisation of the collective agreement.
Mr Bussereau recalled that "a decrease of EUR 100 million in employers' costs" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending finance law for 2009, which was voted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate to vote it "in identical terms."
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to enterprises belonging to that organisation, and secondly to the whole profession, in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be "as soon as possible," Mr Bussereau said.
Opposition from employers' organisations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupe market," as the €100 million "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate urgently, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but in order not to upset the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, Unostra deplored.
For the West, the agreement risks "digging down the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months."
RER A: Disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
Disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban transit line, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between unions and RATP management left them on their hunger for their premium request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10: 00 a.m. and 8: 00 p.m., with one train out of two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train out of four outside the central section.
Interconnection with SNCF will be suspended at Nanterre Préfecture, which will require passengers to switch trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve department stores."
The RER A crosses from west to east the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran during peak hours, and almost no trains in off-peak hours, as expected.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Franciens having organized themselves.
Thus in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequented than usual, especially because of the absence of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), 29-year-old engineer Jack Nbakina explained that he had risen "an hour thirty before, to make sure he arrived on time."
Saint-Lazare station did not experience saturation, said SNCF, which had planned to train officers and law enforcement officers.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left Saint-Lazare station to reach the metros.
New general meetings of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to discuss the results of a meeting with management on Friday afternoon, which were deemed "lean" by the unions.
The RER Director proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development etc.
This is not what drivers want, who claim a bonus due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even put its premium proposals in parentheses, outraged the CGT, pointing out that the management "was not doomed to solve a problem while among the truckers and the SNCF it was done."
A new meeting is scheduled for Monday for "a broader examination of the conditions of exercise of the profession," specified the RATP.
This also led the unions to say that the company "made fun of the weekend users."
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the management, which until then refused any discussion during the strike, had suggested "in the interest of appeasement" the meeting.
The conflict threatens to widen to the RER B on Tuesday, after the advance notice by Unsa and Independents.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 variable euros (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independent) and complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this line to the million daily passengers.
The drivers of RER, all in the second part of their career, receive between 2,200 and 2,700 euros gross and 600 to 650 euros in premiums for off-schedule hours, Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves the pro-Kurdish party, a decision that has far-reaching consequences
On Friday, the Turkish Constitutional Court declared the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by expressions of anger in the Kurdish community, in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision is likely to greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just extended its hand to the Kurdish community in an attempt to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "hotbed of activities detrimental to the independence of the State and its indivisible unity," the President of the Court Hasim Kiliç told the press, after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to declare the dissolution, said Mr Kiliç, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including President Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation by the Treasury of the party's property.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabelled parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to qualify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The Court's verdict comes at a time when the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, in an attempt to derail Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders had claimed that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in the south-east of Anatolian, where many demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan have degenerated into clashes with the police in recent weeks.
As soon as the court was announced, a thousand demonstrators gathered outside the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the south-east, mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement officers fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, as protesters threw molotov cocktails or stones, with swarms.
Some 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. Türk stated that the Justice decision would "deepen despair."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are opposed, as a matter of principle, to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
This decision is a total torpedo of the democratic opening launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that had killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a harsh winter.
But the person in charge of the road clearing and sandblasting service (FES) makes it clear that it is not to annoy the citizens.
It is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn to master it well.
And according to the meteorologists, it might be for this weekend.
More than 300 officers and 120 vehicles stand ready to attack snow and ice.
The FES follows a very elaborate plan here.
Mr Brauburger explained that as soon as it snows on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sandblasting vehicles travel 20 main routes (known as Route A).
This includes traffic streets, main arteries, such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire-fighting access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The officers of the FES begin their service at three o'clock in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometres of road must be salted with a road fondant that adheres well, within 3 hours of maximum time.
This is why the FES service starts at 3: 00 in the morning "so that the roads are cleared when the traffic of daily migrations begins."
Where it gets harder, it's when the snow starts falling at 7: 30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sandblasting department "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass through."
Then, if it does not snow, access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße - are taken care of.
Secondary lanes and side streets come last.
Mr. Brauburger is well aware that this still causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrian team set off to identify as a priority the areas considered dangerous and the passages.
As for cycle paths, the services of the FES can generally not deal with them.
Mr Brauburger pointed out that there was a special department in Frankfurt to monitor the condition of bridges between 10 p.m. and 4: 30 a.m.
As ice is formed very quickly on these surfaces, the salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
The police may also call on this special service if necessary.
The cradle of dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled the other carnivorous dinosaurs: this bipod was about 2 metres long by 1.50m high, its posterior limbs were strong, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended with sickle claws and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would not have had anything exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and his colleagues in the Science magazine on Thursday, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs with these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at that time was part of the land of the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was on its way to the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa illuminates the evolution of the first dinosaurs in a new day.
In fact, he informs us about the kinship relationships, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt began excavations with other paleontologists at the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and member of the excavation team reports that they sometimes found a dozen bones in a day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Trias.
Scientists soon realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the early evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indians' word for the god of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Trias are extremely rare and are limited to a few incomplete bone fragments.
Not all paleontology experts share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery to be particularly spectacular, but he points out that it confirms some theories concerning the early development of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the very first dinosaurs.
The experts wonder, among other things, when the saurians divided into three major evolutionary groups: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaurus and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds on the long neck, and those related to them and the ornithisian herbivores of which species such as triceratops and stegosaurus belong.
According to studies by S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers found evidence that the Tawa hallae possessed small air bags in its skull, as did the birds that were the descendants of the Theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It appears that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small air bags in its bones.
Since the related line of the huge saupods also possessed air bags and light frame, it may be assumed that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaurs known lived in South America, researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major evolutionary lines divided and spread from South America to the rest of the world, that is to say, the entire land area that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, say researchers.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, paleontologist in Bonn says there is an even older species, silesaur, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a dinosaur-related group.
According to him this could give a misconception because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era, when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch, is still a mystery today.
During the Triassic period, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of the present crocodiles and many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread over the whole planet, promoting the development of many new species, while others, who were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction that dinosaurs have survived randomly while other reptiles have disappeared.
Or else, dinosaurs were better suited and they were able to eliminate competition on the ground.
In any case, such success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite encouraged the development of a group of animals which had also developed during the Triassic period and which since then had been in the shade: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
There are lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The evacuation by police from the casino at J.W. Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves all over the planet.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University, as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the Protestant students of Campus Westend.
In a statement written in German and English, they condemn the intervention of the police called for by the university's governing committee.
Last week, the President of the University Werner Müller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers of graffiti after walls and works of art had been burned with graffiti.
Five students were injured during the evacuation.
The signatories considered that the degradation did not justify "such violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own courses."
Evacuation is an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimize and criminalize protest" and attempts to obscure the reasons for mobilization.
The Governing Committee of the University has thus evaded the discussions which would be indispensable.
The trial officers demand that the criminal proceedings instituted be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not take part in the damage.
Legitimation of protests
The young people of the Verdi trade union in the services sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
Protests are only a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, Verdi's regional youth secretary.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she has taken up the cause of the action taken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and deterioration of the place is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament last Thursday during the television show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said CDU Member of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition parliamentary groups SPD, the Greens and the Left (die Linke) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of some painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the students' arguments and demands, they are removed.
The Left Party has tabled a motion to the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new "Silicon-valley"
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place for the search for secret weapons under strict surveillance.
Today, with 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the centre of Moscow, the town has a reputation as the Soviet Silicon Valley.
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008 representatives of Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the centre of the French-speaking sciences - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were reciprocal meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a "Protocol of close cooperation."
The signatories were Vice Mayor of Moscow Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz Head of Project Section for Frankfurt.
In 2010 representatives of FIZ and SMEs, whose main focus is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is a long-term scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the other hand, Russian scientific companies wish to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is the headquarters of famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
There is the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssijskaja-Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literal translation "Green City") takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centres are located.
The S21 project: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be set high enough.
For its supporters it is nothing less than "the new heart of Europe."
If you want. S21, it is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg, into a hopeless chaos of construction sites for about ten years.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
Headline stations, with tracks ending in the middle of the city, had the reputation at the time of being relics of 19th-century transport technology that acted as a brake shoe for modern rail traffic because it used to take a long time to move locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure - that's what we have to do.
That is why head-end stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is about half way on the Trans-European Rail Magistrate between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava, hence the slogan "heart of Europe."
The implementation of the S21 project will really begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-of-line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are modern, reversible trains with railcars and driver cars at both ends.
However, the realization of Stuttgart 21 is now being launched next to the new route of the inter-city line towards Ulm.
Regional and communal policies have won.
The railway company is on the side because it is the taxpayer who bears the risk of the largest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
An urban space is obtained which - based on computer-generated planners' graphs - will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the widening of the section are designed for a traffic of people that was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the time there was still no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic as rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than truck transport on the road.
But the new route, with its inclinations, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other railway projects.
For example, six billion euros will be swallowed up in the Swabian project.
That's the official figure.
Experts think that ten to fifteen billion are more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other points of junction and congestion in the network.
The list of the Ministry of Transport lists a total of sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the extension of the section through the Rhine valley of 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987 this line has been built in slow motion.
It would be really urgent to press the mushroom in this room.
But project S21 is the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine valley route is becoming the bottleneck for international freight traffic in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport judgment
At the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court concerning the prohibition of night flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU / FDP coalition had instructed experts to examine from a legal point of view the judgement of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Tribunal had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation concerning the prohibition of night flights in the event that the construction of the north-west runway of Frankfurt airport would take place.
The authorisation to land for 17 aircraft between 11: 00 and 5: 00 a.m., as envisaged by the Land Government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against nocturnal air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by 4 January if it wishes to make an appeal in cassation against the judgement handed down.
The opposition criticises this delay and tries to put pressure on the government representative to give up the appeal to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The leader of the parliamentary group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections to ban night flights. Otherwise, this will be conditioned as a total breach of a given word.
It is quite hard to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir by alluding to the FDP's electoral slogan "We keep our promises."
Minister Dieter Posch refutes Schäfer-Gümbel's criticism that the Land government is still trying to allow night flights using "oatmeal and rublidians."
It takes time to conduct a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression."
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its party's statements on the ban on night flights is completely flawed.
US banks pay back aid
The big American banks, heavily affected by the crisis, are disconnecting from their ties to the state.
The Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had repaid to the Treasury in full $45 billion (more than €30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp rescue plan.
The American television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering paying back the aid received.
In this way, banking institutions seek to remove the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of the sums, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the payment of higher fees.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase through the sale of securities to investors, which brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's cashes, which are well-filled thanks to the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Last Wednesday night, Kenneth Lewis, the Managing Director of the Bank of America, expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayers: the injection of capital has greatly helped to overcome a difficult period.
The bank had assumed its capacity by buying Merrill Lynch investment bank at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup also plans to obtain money from the financial markets in order to free itself from state guardianship.
As a result, the US bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase as early as Thursday, reporting the CNBC channel quoting banking circles.
The Spokesman for Citigroup did not wish to comment on this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley banks repaid the public funds they had received.
Accelerated election
In the end, everything went ahead faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current director-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German chain ZDF, the successor is already appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the nomination.
Peter Frey, who heads the Berlin editorial office of ZDF, was the great favourite.
However, the chain did not wish to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, there also appears to have been a willingness not to further harm ZDF intendant Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal is not accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 out of 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the close of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender's contract for five years, but this was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council had expressed their support for Brender's reappointment and 7 had voted against it. Brender's removal by vote was a setback, although predictable for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is the majority in the Board of Directors, had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not wanting to return Brender to his post.
Roland Koch, the Minister-President of the Land of Hesse, organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief on the grounds that the rate of listening to ZDF news had decreased under Brender.
That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, fuzzing the growing political influence on the ZDF.
At the end there were even 35 experts in public law who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch's way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it won't have done any good.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romany languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (radio organ of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor of the ZDF, first of all in the news magazine "heute-journal" (today's newspaper).
From 1988 to 1990, he was deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then corresponded to Washington in 1991 / 92, then and until 1998, he was chief and presenter of the "Morgenegenins" (bimonthly news programme presented in the morning); until 2001 he was head of the foreign policy department of the ZDF and then head of the Berlin editorial department.
After Brender's disgrace, when he had just been elected journalist of the year by the specialized magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint
Koch's opponent on the Board of Directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF's Intergovernmental Treaty so that the steward's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a biased political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to request the withdrawal of the political figures from the ZDF's supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skilfully maneuvered before the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without suspicion of placing a political supporter in the post.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is classified as a leftist liberal.
Great cleaning in university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was drawn up stipulating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination should enable the chosen study module to be closed.
In addition, the workload will have to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions."
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of examinations between universities and abroad.
The Länder have also undertaken to organise more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there must be no different regulations from one Land to another.
Less examinations
Since the start of student protests last June, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the Rectors of Universities have been constantly talking about the fashionable expression: "educability."
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to significantly reduce the number of certain examinations: "Each module should normally be able to be concluded by a single examination," says a paper of about 30 pages on the future conditions of admission to university courses.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the examination burden, skirmishes, which had a significant negative impact on the ability to study, should be stopped.
Moreover, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
Both the modules and the background need to be carefully examined to see if we can avoid this feeling of stifling which we sometimes feel in the choice of courses.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest RAID knowledge on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and flexibility to enable and foster personal initiative."
The new regulation will concern access to new university courses but will also be adapted to existing courses.
These cycles must be "re-accredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will have been reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the Federal Republic of Germany which depend on the accreditation councils set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to put pressure on the agencies so that the programmes were not overburdened and the examination system was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized colleges have already agreed with their regional ministries to take appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate has so far been the only Land to have agreed to provide more resources for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organise tutorial programmes and strengthen educational guidance offices as well as examination offices and the international relations department.
The Länder and universities provide a budget of EUR 10 million for this purpose.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to table an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, only one exam will be required to complete your studies.
The organisation of studies must be more flexible, it must be possible to guarantee the recognition of transcripts from other higher education institutions and access to the Master's degree must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles should have been examined.
Last Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the issue of conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticism was voiced.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students has indicated that he would like the organisation of education policy no longer to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of Ministers and Rectors of Universities.
No later than after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Rectors' Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "the experience of students is very useful to us," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and the possibility for every graduate Bachelor to enrol in a Master's degree.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW steering committee, also asks that the Länder ensure today's Bachelor's students, that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's studies and conditions of study as good as possible.
The Länder therefore need to hire more lecturers.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of reducing access to the Master's degree.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work of the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in a few troubling sentences, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first professor of German and English in Bucharest and later collector in a youth publishing house before settling in Frankfurt on the Main.
Söllner received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the much coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University in Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse literature forum at the Musonturm artist's house in Frankfurt.
He made much talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorted mirror of your Securitate files."
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he recognized before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, whom he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner was awarded the German language prize in 1989 in conjunction with some of the participants.
The enrolment tests began insidiously in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, "someone who has not been able enough to resist the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the honouring of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and his exemplary literary disentanglement with the power mechanisms of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abyss and the baseness of a political system, based on police surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can say from current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim.
In his own Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who interceded in his favor.
"He was able to get it out of all the difficult situations at the time," according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the Securitate spies had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit," after reading the 914 pages of his own file.
It can be assumed that the victims will have speculated and sometimes guessed which real names were the last to hide the names of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike Germany, where consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process in the meantime, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate file is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been continually thwarted and curtailed in past years.
It was not until 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was set up to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS), but the return of the files has been rather slow since then.
There has been a law since 2005 that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate in Temesvar who, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize in Herta Müller, expressed himself in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it possible to express itself here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Of course, many inevitable questions are associated with the Söllner case, as so often happens in a context of hidden guilt.
Why now? Who has been robbed? The balanced response of the listeners, according to Söllner, gives hope that the remainder of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Tumultes at the Champions League
It was felt that a representative arrived there, pulled four pins straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sports goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight less a quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he had just called, an orange plastic bag from the supplier by hand.
The man, whose bald skull attracted attention, let himself be taken to the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise our five-year-old could have taken the wheel himself - he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't drunk with happiness either.
He had had a nice evening, but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
Because it was about to start now.
The words of Switzerland that we had just spoken three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final," that is, in the league of champions thanks to our 3: 1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania "but we must not be blinded by success. It will be a brutal fight not to fall back."
The "big job" is waiting for us on Sunday.
Here, it is a question of repeating to Mainz the results of the league of champions on a daily basis.
And we will have to overcome the weaknesses that have resurfaced after the three hurtful goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Drawing by lot
The eighth final of the Champions League (match 16. / 17. + 23. / 24 February / match back 9. / 10. + 16. / 17. March) will be drawn by lot on 18. December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant entry into office of Babbel's successor was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the one who had brought luck, who had passed on to the destabilized Stuttgart professionals, unwavering motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them that they should focus on their strengths, I advised them to be more courageous, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good but no longer had any effect with the carer Babbel.
He triggered a certain magic, confessed Jens Lehmann - Babbel's supporter -, "in football when there is a new impulse sometimes happens things that would never have been possible."
And Sami Khedira who, after weeks of breaks for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "cool wind" and the method of work of the new leader: "It is someone who takes action and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation. "
But apparently Babbel had missed it.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the course, warns manager Horst Heldt
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs more tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overstate the victory against a completely outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later having had a bad awakening in Leverkusen with the 0: 4, objecta Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said that they had achieved one of the goals of the season, but that there were others who were still far away.
We have not yet passed the difficult course.
That Heldt's 40th birthday doesn't have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, was due to the weekend events that a TV interview with goaltender Jens Lehmann bounced back just before the game started.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would oppose, in response to Lehmann's acerbic criticism.
He accused the management of weakness in style and said that she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged it to be a sign of lack of sovereignty and jealousy, so that his free day after the games had been suppressed.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt pushed forward and announced consequences for the goaltender.
They were no longer at risk of becoming friends for life.
In all cast, they agreed with everything else, that is, without the group's previous work by the replaced coach, the strong sporting and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "largely successful," Heldt and Lehmann replied in choir - and even the man with the plastic bag acquiesced.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot battle in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger incessantly verbally and gestantly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko.
But after twelve tough rounds the Ukrainian defended his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimity of the judges, he imposed himself on the points.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC Federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a point victory at the unaminity of the judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120: 10).
For the third time Klitschko has been defending his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously the Ukrainian had already won twice the World Champion title of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he didn't make the long-awaited knot.
Klitschko, 39 times victorious in 41 professional fights, had to confess twice his defeat because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Bern Arena, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted above all to dictate the fight, from the height of its 2.02 meters, by its left-hand side.
Johnson, eleven centimetres smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from bringing his dangerous right-hand side into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures his blows only rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko calling him "evil zombie" who "is not really capable."
During the weighing on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "so that he could see his eyes."
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008
After a break of almost four years, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin at the time and recovered "his" WBC belt which he had previously abandoned without a fight.
This year, defending his title as a champion, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
"I just took a hit in this fight and am in perfect shape," Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Wladimir is champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it was the British David Hague who, having driven the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Hague cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko, which was scheduled to take place in September.
It seems that his promotion company is now planning to play this game at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Front-line attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused Defence Minister Guttenberg of lying in the Kunduz case.
The SPD and La Gauche parties (die Linke) asked the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg / Berlin - After examining the latest information on the Kunduz air attack, the opposition accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The Minister intentionally "formulated a falsehood" on the deadly strike of two tankers last September, said the leader of the parliamentary group of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, on Saturday during the news release of the ARD channel "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
Clearly, that means he lied.
The order to kill was issued in complete disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is, in essence, the content of the NATO report, which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media reports, the aim of the strike was in reality, not to destroy stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people had been killed or injured in the American air attack that had been launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, the military commander of Kunduz.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in the Federal Parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and her Green Party colleague Renate Künast believe that Angela Merkel should make it clear whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government's Afghan policy if the Chancery, the army and the intelligence services have endorsed this new strategy.
The Government spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The Chancery did not in any way influence the military's actions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were increasing voices expressing doubts about the true reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as presented by the Ministry.
According to SPIEGEL, the information they provided to Guttenberg regarding the attack on the tankers was both correct and complete.
Officially, they allegedly concealed the existence of the NATO report and concealed certain inconvenient details from the Minister.
It is suggested, however, that the two senior officials have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert would in the meantime have requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer
On Saturday, the Department did not wish to comment on these charges and referred to the Federal Parliament's commission of inquiry, which was to be set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in psychic patients, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality merge.
As long as these phenomena occur during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our darkened rooms, we can indulge without hindrance in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, anyone who, awake, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being mad or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychic patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, in the best of cases it is called visions, at the worst of madness.
But even if the trigger and the effect stand out, the visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the second states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are due to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain - primarily dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and achetylcholine - breaks and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
The earthly force of attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dream.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a dream-awakened form; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that compose it."
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a character of a comic book.
His body is in two dimensions with criard colours.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he hangs at the ceiling raz.
He's having a hard time.
Behind him are winged, grimacing devil creatures with a bloody mouth, showing the teeth.
They chased him, kicked him with heavy flamboyant boots, threw him against the walls, he felt pain all over his body.
Telling, mean, screaming voices coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer stand those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of his stereo chain, making it a loop and ties it to a hook fixed to the ceiling.
He goes up on a baffle and runs the loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The buckle comes off.
Let it be a lesson for you, shout the voices in a choir to rip off his tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself treated!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last two years, the first of nearly 20 years.
It was triggered by the LSD.
The diagnosis: schizoaffective psychosis, paranoid, in addition it is manic-depressive, it takes drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a crisis of schizophrenia, the people concerned can no longer make the difference between the inner and outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyper-excitement, which makes them suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between important and insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disruptive signals, the conscious is drowned under sensations.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies emanating from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centred on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry of the Heidelberg CHU (Allgemeine Psychiatry im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrenic is in the middle of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the possibility to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experiencing a hallucination once in his life.
Unlike the dream, according to Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real setting.
Why does our brain do this kind of cabrioles, is always a riddle for researchers.
Exceptional situations can lead everyone to lose their perception of reality momentarily, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that the individuals involved have minimal brain damage.
It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, for example by a mother's viral infection during pregnancy, says Fuchs.
But what remains unexplained is the way in which the anomaly of the neural system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experience can be a psychosis trigger, if there is predisposition.
Similarly hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brain gets hot.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy expensive drugs to get them.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
For ten years, Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and illusory image phenomena: last year he published his results in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Head."
Hallucinations are part of the concurrent phenomena typical of psychoses but also of an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or head trauma.
It is surprising to note that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that treat sensory perceptions, are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain is heating but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this state as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also lack of stimulus, stress, pain of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of participants acknowledged having experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. was 16 years old and lived in a small town in Mecklenburg-Pomerania and went to high school.
A young girl everything to do normal, actually.
If there weren't images and voices.
During recess, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long chestnut hair, speaks to him.
When she answers her comrades look at her, amazed - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She is awake, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
She can even perceive her presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she thinks this young guy is nice.
Am I crazy?, she wonders sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
Often visions are burdensome.
When she is in class, she may not be able to take the course because the teacher is just presenting a new student in her eyes and ears while he is invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations to the table.
At night the apparitions are, in general, frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for sleep that happens too rarely and far too late, she often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dreams already, if the images she sees, the faces grim or the girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she screams to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Fall 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her friend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she came into Internet contact with psychologist Kasten, she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, there is a high probability that they will have hallucinations after some time.
I guess the brain's not busy enough, making sure there's some animation.
Sarah K., a single girl, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was old enough to think, was not her real father.
It is the same brain zones that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, it is therefore very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real. "
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, the mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That's why Kasten advises his patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There's only one step between dreaming and hallucination.
In our world too focused on consciousness, unfortunately, there is a rapid tendency to take imaginary experiments for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and chief doctor of the psychiatry and psychotherapy clinic at the Florence Nightingale hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but it also contains something positive, creative - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of the so-called oniroid experience, a particular form of changing consciousness awakened by the dream.
The oniroid lives are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies, as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that harms his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It's a state of mental limitation between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world is taking place, but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity which is given to us, men, so as not to sink into the nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian, also describes his oniriid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old, when his conscious leaves for a journey of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain still in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he created from scratch, visits foreign places, travels through time. He sees himself as an old man living in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside looking after his health.
He lives in the Middle Ages among nobles who make blood-based narcotics.
He is kidnapped by a Greek on a motorcycle who takes him to his country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the Neve of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
He absorbs himself completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has experienced.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental travels are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience brings out the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, the oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are even in a state of sleep.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summed up psychologist Kasten "can cause a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be quite rewarding.
The first snow can fall
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
The appointment of Kallen to the post of CEO of Burda editions is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to return to the press group, he told Spiegel.
The holding company must remain 100% a family business.
Hamburg - In the long term, the publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at the age of 27 and are firmly determined to join the society, said Hubert Burda, 69, at Spiegel.
All details were settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will arise later.
It will also have to be seen whether they are capable of doing so.
One cannot impose one's children on 7,500 employees without knowing whether they have the capacity to take care of them.
It would demolish children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was withdrawing from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took over the Treasury sector, i.e. he was responsible for the capital of the company and after Jürgen Todenhöfer left he also took the lead in marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of the Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old respectively, her son Felix, who is now 42 years old, died a few years ago.
Nomination of Kallen is also used to link the next 10 or 15 years "
Burda points out that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
The ruins have always taken place in families that have been driven by a bulimia of capital, which have made huge, unhappy speculations thinking that they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I've never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I do not see myself in the role of tutor of the country as Springer could be and I do not intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken on too much importance.
Integral beauty
Everything you can want, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the aim of El Corte Inglés, which has just inaugurated a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre of Callao (Madrid), dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser epilation, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding department, with in particular a tea room, which offers more than 130 different kinds.
Spaxion offers you, among other things, to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or to rent the relaxing area for two hours in order to organize your own "Beauty Party" with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a Jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, 250 m2 is divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also features these devices, as well as virtual "coaches" that guide the steps of customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with the introduction of your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos show us how to perform our exercise program correctly.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And if after having our body worked, we want to go through the hair salon, Ensign Luis & Tachi has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the watchwords of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Various decollections
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the cleavage, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
Singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. This is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, get the electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, created the "Oficina LIVE."
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicles in the Catalan capital.
The "Oficina LIVE" (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the road map for the installation of the electric car in the city and will put in place mobility agreements, taking steps, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In the end, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville come to join the project.
These are the three cities selected by the government, under the MOVELE Plan, to launch the installation of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat de Catalunya.
Its objective is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include energy-related activities, in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups at European level and has a set of complementary projects under way such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a future of tranquillity" for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, envisions "a future of tranquillity" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the country's main export sector.
During the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitiveness Plan for the automotive sector, we would now have a landscape of abandonment, closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquillity for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this connection, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Integral Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), had earmarked EUR 800 million for projects by 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which had mobilized an investment of more than EUR 3 000 million.
The Chief Executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also focused on government demand-side support measures, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, the plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a "sharp increase" in registrations, which increased by "40%" in November.
20,000 m ² of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Exhibition of Collection Cars, a meeting space for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 at the Pabellón de Cristal de la Casa de Campo in Madrid.
This is an exhibition area of 20,000 m ², with more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will there be motorcycles and collectible automobiles, but there will also be items in ClassicAuto Madrid of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
For example, at the pavilion exhibitors, we can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, supplements, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the collection engine world that will make collectors and curious happy.
Among the participating companies are Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, auto sales specialists, Juan Lumbreras, restaurant, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and catering, and Cochera Clásicos, Mercedes Benz.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this exhibition will also include parallel activities: gatherings, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Aptitude tests will also be conducted with collectible automobiles and motorcycles on a circuit located outside the exhibition centre.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A lasting sportsmanship
Mazda intends to prove that the sporting spirit is not angry with respect for the environment.
For this purpose, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine shutdown and startup system, called i-Stop, a device which, at least for the time being, is only available on the 150 horsepower petrol 2.0 engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good score it has achieved overall.
Details, vehicle finish, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, it turns out that the forward seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the control panel and console, we see how Mazda continued in the Japanese trend to create a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and especially with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the passenger compartment, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
Added to all this is a large trunk with regular shapes.
The automatic engine shutdown and start-up system, at least for the moment, is only available on the two-litre, 150-horsepower petrol engine and with manual change of six speeds.
This engine is a real happiness. It is illustrated by its finesse, its low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometres a year should not exclude this i-Stop with petrol engine, both for its high speed comfort and its controlled consumption.
With regard to the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, that is, the one with the greatest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipment, the Track Change Assistant (RVM), which removes blind angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and audio bluetooth, as well as 17-inch alignment wheels, are particularly remarkable.
In addition, as if this equipment were not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes among other elements dual-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disk charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly notable for the quality of the materials used, its behaviour and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive a lot of kilometres per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version associated only with the 150 horsepower gasoline 2.0 engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this large sum, the Mazda3 will offer us every day a great dose of satisfaction.
"First" luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexys for the exit of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark "lady."
FonPeek's promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to view your e-mail, without even offering the possibility of seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the Internet.
He took advantage of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is more difficult to see him on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, less than half the cost of, for example, the iPhone's data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, for six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at The Web, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American brother, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when you cross a border or desperately search for a Wifi cafeteria (or Fon connection) for your mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been working for a long time.
Indeed, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need a thesis in physics to understand them and good glasses to read small characters.
Repeated reminders from the European Commission to offer affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside of the country of origin, we are hesitant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like FonPeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not have Wifi) offers this type of pricing, means that operators start thinking differently and are studying different proposals allowing them to make their data network profitable.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no trouble.
This is a connected device and is paid when it is purchased and not every month.
And that's what I hope to see one day for FonPeek: a life-access option as Peek already offers in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it is a more fair formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's favorite color
The yellow is, no doubt, the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
If she went to take office as President of the United States with a dress and coat of this colour, she chose the same one to accompany her in the second, undoubtedly, most important moment of her life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar pattern on both occasions: in addition to their resembling colour, a yellow drawing green with brilliant reflections, on both occasions, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, jacket and coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So, at first glance, it would appear that the First Lady of the United States is following the wake of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to hand over the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are carved makes them very different.
While it was a thick lace for taking office, it was wearing a printed velvet in Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hair has also changed: the hair is now raised while she was wearing it dropped the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had occupational problems because of their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for younger generation women who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study "Fertility and career of women in Spain," carried out by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer.
The survey, carried out on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have had their professional career limited because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences in the beginning of a couple's life and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not, and the type of employment.
Those who do not work outside the home, work part-time or work with little stability, enter into a relationship earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back entry into marriage and first pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with fixed work have their first child, on average, 3.7 years after settling in a couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those working in the public sector. "These data show that women with stable employment needed more time in their lives to get it, which led them to postpone the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of work performed has a significant influence on maternity, but less on the date of the start of common life, "explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that increases the gap between the marriage age of women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49 age group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
"Another distinction also appears between women, depending on their level of education.
While those with elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those with middle or higher education reverse this program and give priority to obtaining stable work as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child, "says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it, too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several products of the brand, singing the universal motto "Because I'm good at it."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, thus joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millonaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dr. Grey, Anatomy Lessons) and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
Its largest representatives, creators and models, both yesterday and today, gathered for the annual presentation of their prize, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the date.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, elected Best Model of the Year.
Ace poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographs" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes his other life).
He does not do it according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not spare fear or enlightenment.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to reading and rereading.
I'll leave you a few snapshots here.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against mortal destiny, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him."
On Graham Greene: "Our man was inspired by this woman by a passion that lasted thirteen years, in the flesh of which he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
On James Joyce: "The Ulysses was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed by the north face, on which the best climbers still and always fall."
On William Faulkner: "He was a strange guy.
On his own, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and on other occasions that he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were of greatness. "
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer recollected the crazy cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking the posterior with a violent speech to the maggots."
On Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed:" Beloved God, I beg you that I stop writing like a woman. "
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser:" Sleep after effort, / after storm the port, / rest after war, / after life, tired death rejoices. "
On Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband would very normally accept that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was beyond madness. "
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if it wasn't trying to hide Joyce from Baroja?
What did Benet try if it wasn't for Faulkner to shoot Baroja?
What did this do if it was not to aspire to the glory of this man so that he might serve him as a pedestal? "
A cowardly assault
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking around our neighbourhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by her and our dog, a blood melted, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilos, and without saying a word, they kicked her two kicks that left the dog seriously injured.
Our indignation is immense because we don't see what fun it is to attack a defenceless little animal for free, which was also on a leash.
We must add to this the indignation of a woman who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energist who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., on a Tuesday like any other, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog's been moaning all day.
We have of course lodged a complaint at the neighbourhood police station, even if we doubt that this is very useful and in order not to touch the sensitivities, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly assassins were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don't understand what's going on with young people so they find it fun to abuse a defenceless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wearing
The Michelin tire manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage helmet use, mainly among younger motorcyclists, as both structures have indicated today.
The purpose of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing helmets, as this is the only protective element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheel accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign was in line with its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of ever safer products" and stated that it contributed to this goal through other educational and informative actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto "To be or not to be," will include a first phase in which posters will be distributed to over 500 motorcycle garages to ensure their widest distribution.
Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop safer products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decrease, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be qualified, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, registrations accumulated in these 11 months are 40% lower than in the previous fiscal year.
Since January, 95 853 vehicles in the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) have been sold.
The large clouds that affect their demand most have not dissipated, because, although they are also purchased by private individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the time through external financing.
In addition to the restrictions on bank loans, there are other factors, such as the rise in unemployment or the persistence of bad economic conditions.
In view of this situation and the difference between passenger vehicles, aid for the purchase of the 2000E has not served much.
In addition to individuals, self-employed and SMEs wishing to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, the need for the administration to pay particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses) was reiterated.
The concessionaire association is planning a year 2010 similar to the one that is ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (passenger vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock brake system and as with the ESP stability check, emergency braking support systems will be a mandatory element for European cars.
They are already compulsory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure, imposed by the European Union, is to strengthen pedestrian protection, although by its mode of action it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency brake assist works by increasing the brake pressure in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by the Bosch car component manufacturer, one third of the drivers involved in an accident were unable to press the brake before the collision, and half of them did not take full advantage of its force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, in revancha, requires the maximum of the brake system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with such elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even greater with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is calculated that one in four casualties with injuries would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, by means of a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, as well as acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones until January the plan for Opel
While the workers of the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April - probably the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer warned that he will need more time to conclude Opel's relief plan.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, said that each point in the plan had been approved by the party concerned.
And this may mean that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, at GM, it is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
Should there be no agreement with any of them, GM could sell part of Saab to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their last and precious jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and succeeded in thinning just under 80 kilos, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilos.
This led them to avoid, first of all, the automatic roof which was replaced by a manual tarpaulin roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilos, to use aluminium doors like those of the GT3, another 15 kilos less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilos, to reduce the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, 7 kilos gained, to mount sports boots, 12 kilos more, and with light tires of 19 inches, five kilos.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, earning another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double clutch PDK box, the test was carried out on a six-speed manual transmission model, mainly on roads in the secondary network of California, in the mountains, with particularly twisted turns.
His behaviour can only be described as impeccable.
The weight reduction does not prevent the car from riding on the ground with a lead.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we tested such a small and light model which, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in turns, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at low speed for the necessary time, until we ask him to sprinter, brake, recover and push his engine again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands will indicate on the wheel.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Engine sound at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be reinforced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the roar of the engine, already used on the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is brutal, whether at a standstill or during recuperations.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The pavement of the roads we travelled with the Boyxster Spyder was pretty damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic assistants barely showed up on the entire route, while on some turns we found ice cream in the early morning and gravels later in the morning.
In the end, an ultra-light car, the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than a simple modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be available for sale in February 2010 at a price of €70,831.
"Bag Girl"
Close friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the house's parades, the singer shows her face as a bad girl with as much capacity as her Chanel bags.
More than a "Bad Girl" or a "It Girl," it's a "Bag Girl."
Baskonia takes victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral won a brilliant victory at 91-82 during its visit to the difficult terrain of Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by Dusko Ivanovic's team. She is thus at the top of her group, after Mirza Teletovic's big show which, with eight three-point baskets was the best of her team (29 evaluation).
Vitoria's team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 three-point baskets marked, largely determined the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took the advantage from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of Vitoria's team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped on the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barac's inner game and Eliyahu's work, which was received with cheers and applause back to his old home, to increase their advantage at the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already getting noticed as the best player on his team, with 13 points scored, although Splitter's "minus six" evaluation already suggested that tonight was not going to be Brazil's best.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria's team that it was not so easy to win on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand," they managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to making the yolks take advantage of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from dead, needed to chain some skillful actions to get the air, and it was at that time that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun arose which, with three baskets with three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas, returned the counter to a reassuring score (54-67), and which the locals managed to accentuate at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
Avala's team went out to play for the last period, and English and San Emeterio (60-75) advised that they would not tire of taking what they had earned for the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini y Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for mistakes, the Ivanovic players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis came closer at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped at Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
The Unicaja lost noisy in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the head of Euroleague Group B in a game marked by the absence of Unicaja players, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship or the size of the rival, probably one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed to make the Andalusian dream. An aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two of the leader Omar Cook and one of Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the local team with the inner game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, allowed to reverse score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when an action, a start of fighting, between North American leaders Beverley and Williams led to the disqualification of the two players.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority in both camps, while the exit for injury of the English pivot Joel Freeland and Carlos Jiménez's three personal faults weighed on Unicaja.
The domestic players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, dug the 44-32 advantage in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible ride
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to match the difference of the match at Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to stumble.
Unicaja was trying to overcome the absences and the last exit of the Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis's support, left a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was almost impossible because the Olympiacos were relentless when the players were exerting pressure and showing their superiority in centimetres in the area.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, at the thirty-seventh minute, and the Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympiacos.
How much should you be paid based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate ads, jobs and vehicles in Spain.
The "How much should you be paid?" tool calculates users' salaries from more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, using a form available on Facebook, where you have to register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For a week since the application was running, the search engine has detected that in general, the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid," explained in a press release the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovitfrom its search engines in the United Kingdom and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives €45,226 gross per year and a French programmer, 31,059, while a Spanish programmer receives €24,000.
Similarly, a driver receives €34,247 gross per year in England, 25,751 gross in France and 16,420 gross in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter, with 11,592 net euros annually, followed by that of a salesman, with 14,725 euros, and that of a worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, half-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil sets a date for the departure of Zelaya
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya's stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The overthrown president must abandon the diplomatic legation no later than 27 January 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian Embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the Embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
"He is aware that he must leave on January 27, after his term of office, he must look for another destination."
The channel also quoted the former agent, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the November 29 elections (during which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government chaired by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the pink days since last spring, in which asset inflation has been the dominant market note, uncertainty arises again, which is not surprising as it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by providing abundant liquidity at near-zero rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to be mobilised.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalised and, without calling into question their non-compliant liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB has done, with their allotment to one year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond spreads are increasing again, although they remain far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt has again been affected.
There is once again a leap towards quality, and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the investors' chosen refuges, leading to an increase in the differences between the euro area countries and Germany.
Spain was barely touched by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's threatened with a further downward revision of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to silence the moral risk advocates, who were once again trying to provoke a case of consciousness among those responsible for world economic policy who had slowed down the destructive effects of credit restrictions on the destruction of employment, whereas what should be done is to declare a new day of Thanksgiving.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that hides a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-compliance with its external payments at the beginning of the year and allow a euro area member country to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are faced with an episode of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after a few excesses in high positions, that would be predictable.
In the case of Spain, as long as our public debt differentials increase in line with the bonds of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If the European differences were reduced and our differences continued to increase, then this would be a Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our predictive indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery models and to revise their forecasts upwards for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which are coming back with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it does not bode well for their warning.
Again, this seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the time being "prudence is the mother of safety."
Connected sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán outlined for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, eight-closed.
For the President of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest EUR 50 000 million until 2020 and an additional EUR 60 000 million between that date and 2030, should the nuclear power plants now in operation remain open.
If this is not the case, the necessary investment would not amount to 60 000 million, but 95 000.
On the other hand, Iberdola considers that for the next decade investments should not be directed towards increasing production capacity, but towards distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue changed, and power would have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal-fired power plants, with carbon dioxide recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18,000 MW are needed, together with other "support energies."
Galán, who believes that the draft Sustainable Economy Law that the government has just approved is in line with what his company is calling for, did not wish to attack the Royal Decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this direction, despite the "one-off" measures, as the President of Iberdrola has described them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time to reach maturity and a stable income-generating framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins the Aer Lingus handling market at ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for airport services on land, will play the role of privileged partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been revealed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a collaboration protocol yesterday to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Centre.
The alliance anticipates an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to carry out energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona fights its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession highway in Australia, a market on which it is already working as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is an estimated $1,700 million (approximately €1,047 million) tunnel.
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and highway concessionaire.
The city council wishes to be able to dispose of it by the end of 2014.
After choosing public / private collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to carry out the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be responsible for the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their offers in May, the planned investment amounts to 1,700 million Australian dollars (approximately 1,047 million euros) and in the final phase three consortia are competing, with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only smooth Spanish company, and its associates are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European underground workers.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium was formed, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French manufacturer group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium that passed the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh public works company, Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major construction projects and privatizations, but entry is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, which is still an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has just won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire assets
Acciona relies on a geographical area of the greatest importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the sector of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and runs a group of companies to build and manage Adelaide's desalinizer, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the markets for infrastructure construction and management.
The underground toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (northern link), is intended to connect the western Toowong motorway to the peripheral road at Kelvin Grove (see map), through 4 kilometres of tunnel. This is the largest existing project to reduce traffic congestion in Brisbane.
The timetable set by the Administration indicates that the award will take place during the summer of 2010 and that work will start in December of next year.
Despite the fact that this toll track will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will consist of two lanes, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government will provide Australian $500 million (€308 million) for its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make substantial profits Hochtief, who mentioned yesterday that he was getting a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national high-speed fibre network.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have rapid access to the Internet and will provide work to the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has divested the 27-storey King George Tower construction project in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet started and Hochtief has sold for 129 million.
In the United Kingdom, specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be EUR 75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded €64.5 million for the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company obtained this contract a few days after it was entrusted with the expansion of the Bosruck tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine thus consolidates its experience in tunnel construction.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Sra. Rushmore is awarded the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services of the next two years to the agency Sra. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros a year, said the railway operator.
The contract mentions the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was chosen from 16 agencies that presented themselves to the tender organized by Renfe, of which four were finalists, including TBWA, which has been responsible for creativity over the last three years.
From now on, Sra. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Telecom to curb competition
France Telecom was fined €63 million by the French competition regulator for its anti-competitive conduct in the country's Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator has limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer loyalty programmes on the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, because of the obstacles it places to its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore repeat.
An application shop
On the other hand, the mobile phone subsidiary of the French company followed the follow-up of other operators and opened an Internet application shop, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange's application shop will be active in France and the United Kingdom.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has earned 476.4 million in Real Madrid and Barça since its inception.
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its birth in 1992.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona won 467.4 million, placing them in third and fifth place in the clubs that have won the most money in this competition.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
The Manchester United is at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
The competition allocated €5 362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who have participated in the event since the tournament's inception in the 1992-93 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third in the continent to receive the most money for its participation, and the only one, with the A.C. Milan, has won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that also billed the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And this, though they lost in front of the Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as far as the money reported by the Champions League is concerned, although it has won more titles than any other country (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure of distributing money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to earn 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will spend $413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the classification games (including the Madrid Atlético) received $2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each game played.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighth finals receive three million each, the eight teams who arrive in the quarter finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win $9 million, against the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, under fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, the Barça won $2.5 million for winning the Super European Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which are spent 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four designated places.
The previous year's champion takes 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played during the current year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group listed yesterday the details of the offer to purchase shares by which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a public offer of acquisition (OPA) for all securities.
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers €1,5025 per share, which will be disbursed over 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this carry-over.
Yesterday, Sos's shares finished at €1.85; Nueva Rumasa's offer therefore estimates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos' real valuation.
The offer is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 councillors.
The Jerez group gives 15 days for shareholders to indicate their interest in selling the securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company of the Ruiz Mateos claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it were to take place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos is continuing the restructuring of its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and the judicial go and come of its former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leading position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not without controversy, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar societies.
Moreover, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal further embezzlement cannot be ruled out.
With regard to credit to the Salazar, former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the misuse of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorises the OPA of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body explained that it authorized this transaction because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the contents of the explanatory sheet presented to be "sufficient" as a result of the amendments applied on 2 December.
The CNMV has specified that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the share capital, composed of 6 142 786 shares admitted to trading on the exchanges of Madrid and Bilbao.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed, and that they could in no way be transmitted before the bid was finalized, the price of which he indicated had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current standards.
New tools for car expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a disaster are brought back to a garage, where an expert must assess the damage and the cost of repair.
Each claim is different, and the calculation of the cost of parts and labour time can be a long and complex task.
Calculating by hand the cost of a repair between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including coins and labour can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the help of the latest IT tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
For this reason, almost 100% of experts use such systems.
Providers of claims assessment and maintenance services and solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers as a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of evaluation tools and the development of information on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by the manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed has been steadily increasing, with the result that over the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the previous 15 years.
When a new car comes out on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very difficult task, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and record its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image of each model is created on which you can click on the different parts of a passenger car.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it may take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars marketed in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have for example information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
For vehicles in use, the figure exceeds 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) to carry out documentation and database development work, and each of them specializes in certain brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than 100 technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million annually to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer various products.
The most common application is repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company with a guide to the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex doesn't offer it in our country, but she does it in the United States.
In view of Audatex's products, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that Audatex can provide to industry professionals.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard claim assessment solution for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint scales.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is €5.75, for customers who use it little, up to a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of expertise, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it is removed from the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glasses, and AudaSubastas is an open server to the professional sector over the Internet that allows to bid on vehicles declared wrecks.
Its statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geo-demographic analyses or understanding common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a particular brand have gone to the garage for a breakdown or how many have suffered serious losses for a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tool.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the manufacturer's official parts, prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of car losses, failures or maintenance.

Internet auctions of injured cars
Last October, Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of damaged cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The operation involved a cost of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the opportunity to access a huge international market.
This estimation and sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, crashes and professional vendors who must be registered before starting operations.
The platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Its main markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 vendors and 4000 registered experts on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads a day and on the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collection cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage description in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential element of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist vehicles, 109 all-terrain vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are necessary.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified with its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labour prices, increases or discounts, and then print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a catalogue of references.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one for garages does not include estimated labour time.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be credited.
Currently, Audatex works to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see very well, since it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to see the inner face.
