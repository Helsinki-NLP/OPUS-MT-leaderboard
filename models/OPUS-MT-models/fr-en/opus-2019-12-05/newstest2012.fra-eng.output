Parliament has not ratified the amendment for Tymosenko's release
The Ukrainian parliament has refused, as part of an amendment to the criminal law, the proposed annulment of the paragraph on the indictment of Julia Tymosenko, the leader of the opposition.
At second reading, MEPs rejected the draft amendment aimed at reducing the penalties for economic crimes, which could have opened the doors to freedom for the former Prime Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was sentenced in October to 7 years' imprisonment for having entered into a pre-eminent disadvantageous agreement with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgement is not final and the court must decide on the appeal of the convicted person in December.
Tymosenko described the ruling as political vengeance of the regime and caused a process of suspicion of court bias also in the west.
The draft annulment of paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Premère Minister was convicted, was signed by 147 deputies.
It would have taken 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan victory
The Libyan liberation or rebellion already has its vanquished.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over.
The winners have yet to be determined.
As is customary in the region, the winners in the elections are the Islamists, but they are moderates or radicals.
The Provisional National Council has decreed the usual law of Sharia and we already know what this is about.
Libya becomes a country without crime because for a robbery you cut off your hand.
Women can forget about emancipation, if they do not respect the faith, they are liable to the death penalty...
It is the Qur'an that will unite the society of opposing tribes instead of the dictator's personality.
In Libya such an order will prevail as we cannot represent ourselves and as we certainly would not like.
But our way of life is not unique, is not objectively the best and would probably not benefit the Libyan people.
It is particularly surprising that the Islamist warriors accepted the aid with recognition of the unfaithful dogs.
The only excuse is that it was not an American general who led the NATO strikes, but rather Allah, whose greatness they celebrated every attack.
So when it comes to looking for the winners in Libya, the West is not one of them.
We participated in the shooting, served Islam and our poilists turned away from the dictator as a political ally without any profit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not occupying Libya militarily.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to get rid of the "crusaders."
Without land occupation, oil companies will have easy access to Libyan black gold.
Perhaps not so much, and the West will finally be able to boast of the protection of human rights.
For the sake of preventing these sharia followers from doing so.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe are in the minds of investors.
A tornado of statistics passed on Tuesday over Europe.
Each of the states published GDP-related information for 3A.
The Czech economy has stagnated in the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The bond market is breaking all the records.
Investors look not only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries published earlier their visions of economic development for the third quarter.
Germany's GDP is expected to grow by 0.5%, while France's GDP is expected to grow by 0.4%.
The two countries changed the data for the second quarter in which Germany was better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), but France reported a slight decrease of 0.1% (the cause of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter.
However, GDP has stagnated and according to the Czech Statistical Office it is confirmed that the trend is towards a gradual decline in economic growth.
The results are worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter but stagnated in the last quarter.
In the third quarter, the German economy grew by 0.5% according to forecast and periodically recalculated data.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2% between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is what analysts had predicted.
The Greek economy fell by 5.2%.
Ten-year bond yield is 28.45%
The bond yields of Spain and Italy are rising to critical limits.
The problems are beginning to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc...
The yields of Czech bonds remain below 4%, while the situation in the region is worsening.
There are voices in Germany saying that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance.
The Czech Republic has qualified for the EURO.
They won in Montenegro 1: 0 and celebrate the qualification for 200 million
The representation of football has succeeded its most difficult mission of the season!
In Montenegro, she also won thanks to Super Cech and netminder Petr Jiracek 1: 0.
Czech football has also defended its qualification with great luck in the second part and will not miss the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the qualifying match with a detailed report.
No special excitement during the first part and a lot of luck for the second part.
The Czech performance also won thanks to the Super Cech and hero Petr Jiracek with 1: 0 in Montenegro and celebrates his qualification at the European Championship.
The Montenegrins were under pressure until the second part because of a specific Czech defence.
The vicitmes of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who missed two chances to score a goal.
And thanks to the super Petr Cech the Czech representation will not be absent at the European championship next year, and in addition a reward of 200 million crowns in the Czech football fund.
From the first few minutes, we played warrior football.
Both teams had difficulty assembling combinations and the game was concentrated mainly around the central line.
The pressure of the national footballers failed to break through the Czech defence, which responded precisely to the long shots even during the first half.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's nuclear program.
They created a human shield.
A few hundred college students have created a human shield around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support their country's nuclear programme in the face of a possible Israeli assault.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the deaths of the EU and Israel.
A few hundred students from the universities of Ispahan created a human shield on Tuesday around the nuclear technology center of Ispahan where uranium is processed.
They thus openly expressed that they would defend their country's nuclaire programme at the risk of their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has found in its latest information that Iran has continued to strengthen its nuclear weapons.
There are reports in Israel of a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
The students began to pray at noon in front of the site and then wished the deaths of the EU and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at destroying Iran's nuclear programme, the targets would be not only Ispahan, but also the site of Natanz where uranium is enriched.
Eating an obese child: don't eat breakfast and take cold meats for dinner
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, 9% are above average and 5% are obese.
As current research shows, obese children come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important the environment in which human beings evolve and the models that surround them are.
On tables of obese children, for example, we find cold meats 50% more often than in families of children with normal weight.
19% of obese people had french fries at dinner according to the survey carried out with an awareness campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence"
In families of big kids sport is also not a habit, which is now the case for most of today's schoolchildren - only 15% replied that at least once a week parents found time for active movement.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place in the last school year and involved 900 pupils from primary schools in the Czech Republic.
This was the second edition of "Obesity is no coincidence," supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever Company.
Since the beginning, more than 12,000 students in the sixth to third grades have enrolled in this project.
One of the determining factors causing a dramatic increase in the number of overweight and even obese children is the lack of proper nutrition and not enough exercise.
"Only half of the children questioned say, for example, eating 5 times a day breakfast-in case - lunch-tasting-dinner, which is a basic principle of good nutrition," says one of the survey results.
Without breakfast and cold meats at dinner
Specialists point out that healthy development requires some basic details such as a family breakfast at the same time.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of the pupils' families eat at the same time.
In the majority of families everyone has breakfast alone.
And the worst thing that has been noted is that one tenth of the population does not have breakfast at all.
Breakfast is, however, the basis for a good daily diet.
The questionnaire showed that in the families of obese children unhealthy fries are used more often.
Almost every student - not to mention weight - drinks sweet drinks every day (70%).
More than 40% of the children questioned do sport regularly, but for parents it is half, only 15%.
Get your food ready.
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to prepare their own diet from the possibilities offered according to their own taste and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children between the ages of 12 and 15 are far from ideal in terms of healthy eating."
Among their favourite dishes are a lot of cakes, meats and sweets.
"The most alarming is a great preference for sweet lemonades," is indicated in the results of the survey.
For lunch it was the pasta that took the first place right in front of the white meat.
Children did not want starch at all and the preference for fish and vegetable meals was very low.
Health focus
The survey also showed that children are ready to change their habits from the moment they receive the ad hoc information.
"During a survey of a group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the awareness session" Obesity is no coincidence, "there was a strong commitment to a healthy diet," the survey results indicate.
For example, the most striking was in the case of sweet lemonades, as children began to give preference to drinking water.
Children most often checked white meat and fish as the main dish and would reduce sweet dishes and "knedliky" (Czech speciality of bread flour or potato pellets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a presentation article on how to learn for stylists, I got a little angry at the fact that there were a lot of them from the beginning.
I wasn't thinking about what would happen afterwards.
Presentations by three professionals of the speciality, the clothing of the characters and a seminar on what is happening on the spot.
And it'll be worse.
The closer we get to the final examinations, the more practical exercises and information we expect.
And even when there are classes on Saturdays and Sundays it's really "drunk."
This time we have with Director Alenka (during the course there are no boys) treated the way to dress the woman who has no standard measurements.
And women of this type are the majority.
One has a small neck, the other a boy's body, with no particular curve, and another with overweight.
The stylist should know how to optically scale wide arms, extend a neck or add necessary curves.
So we managed to highlight the character nicely and also not to dress too visually women types like Jennifer Lopez with a strong chest and sharp hips and a fine waist.
If, for example, there is a difference between waist and hips in such a way that skirts or trousers do not pass at all, it is worth it to make it tailor-made.
And you will not regret it because the clothing that falls impeccably is priceless.
In a custom skirt you will feel much better than in the one that always slips, wraps up and doesn't hold on to the belt and so on.
For those who have a masculine appearance can afford a Tucker style clothing, with stitched pieces of fabric, or even embroidery.
There are obviously many examples of different appearances and I am glad that I have all week to sort out all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that because of what I have to do at home, there's too much to do.
Each intern received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening.
We need to consider the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I'll have to "dress" Miranda Kerr, who maybe you know of the Victoria Secret campaign.
Deep down, I'm glad, because it's better than dressing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who's taken almost a hundred kilos lately (don't take my statement, please, completely seriously) or the young Selena Gomez.
We need to cut and sew from magazines or search the internet, print and work on graphics.
The Moodboard, as they say for the final result, expresses our personal style as well as our relationship with graphic creation.
Thinking about the graphic part of styling is also important.
The stylist does not thus dress only physics but creates for example productive pages in magazines (on given products trends for handbags, coats, etc...).
Mario Kamenik, stylist and graphic designer, told us about all this.
But that,... until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general vision
Three guests from the specialty gave a diverse look to Saturday's session filled with information about the different types of characters.
Honza Pokorny, stylist, Jakub Polanka fashion designer and Ben Renc, fashion photographer.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the designer should know how to use it.
And a talented stylist knows how to work with one suit in a different way.
For this example, variability is paramount.
Like for example this trench-coat that has to be worn in a classic way with a jeans and a t-shirt like a light coat but also it can dress the naked body, with snails and take a picture like a dress.
Or you just have to go up the sleeves or the collar and immediately have a new look.
"Play with it," he said.
But I particularly enjoyed the following advice: "For work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"You can then start to contradict it," Jakub said.
Finally, I understand why we try to learn these rules, what to do with, about what, why, while in fashion magazines we sometimes see something else.
No statement on fashion shows.
I know again, thanks to fashion photographer Ben that the stylist must have a lot more clothing variants than those that are photographed.
That is to say that for fashion story that will have about ten pages (so about ten models) I must be ready to "untie" at least a fortnight.
And also, a garment and its combination with other elements appear completely different than in reality.
We have to count on this in the course of creating a model.
The fact that image and style sometimes make half the success has been confirmed by Honza Pokorny.
Just look at Madonna who isn't a great singer but her image and marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylists' services is still flickering.
And the known faces sometimes consider them useless (I just know something but what I'm getting is second).
And if someone gets styled on our part, then we have to rely on the fact that he dictates us with a great probability a completely different size (smaller) than he actually has.
Then we only have to browse google and make sure that the boulevard news shows the celebrity in question, whether it has lost weight or grown bigger, etc...
Honza and Mario placed us on Sunday on the heart that it is not enough for the designer to orient himself in fashion and to know how to assemble models.
He must communicate with the people he dresses and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist.
Knowing how to guess people, not flattering yourself, keeping one's opinion.
"When a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything away and tell him, My God, what a horror."
"You'll find some things you'll find pretty and he'll advise you with what to wear them," Mario said.
This one has shown us in concrete terms what everything should contain what is called the "placovka" or bag of the stylist.
This is the one you hang around the waist and have on you for everything you need.
In addition to clearly defined things such as scissors, reels for depilation or nanny pins, there is also nylon wire (which the designer uses to photograph products like bags, or hats), special clips with which a garment is closed in the back, if it is too large (the pin or other type of clip is not usable because they could damage the garment) or a sewing kit.
For us not only to be people who listen but who have tried something in a practical way they have taught us how to properly resemulate shoes.
And during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal, the sole could get damaged, fortiori outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We had no right to touch the scissors so we wouldn't inadvertently hurt each other.
Therefore, there is a real need for expertise.
Mario pleased me when he congratulated me on my creation.
The skill I'm referring to is not for my girlfriend.
This is only a small summary of what we learned during the second course weekend.
I'm starting to understand more and more that making styling a profession is not a walk in a rose garden, let everyone say what they want.
The need for speed The Run is fighting all over America.
Revision
Originally a problem-free race turns into a series of stupid mistakes of people who don't care about it into a routine morning shift at work.
It fulfills everyone's ambition to some extent, but it is useless if no one wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled The Run produced high expectations before it was released.
He promised to take a new direction with the race series Need for Speed already old and to release a kind of game from playable games that would not only count with points.
So we were curious how will be the added passages during which the main hero gets out of his car and does what he wants.
As is already done in the NFS series, the result is completely different from what was expected.
These are potentially arcade racing games but the whole is pulling down because of some unnecessary mistakes that have already existed for several years.
These are not really mistakes, but rather the expression of an incomprehensible laziness on the part of the developers.
The adventure begins very well.
You are caught in the adventure of which the chief hero Jack has characteristic problems and to solve them begins to participate in illegal races throughout America.
You sit behind the wheel on the west coast of San Francisco and your mission is to arrive first in New York.
The idea has some interesting elements.
The route is divided into ten stages and then more than 50 races.
As a result, each race takes place on another route and the stages planned in different environments that are quite different from each other and interesting.
The player does not feel for a moment that the game offers him something identical.
Some environments are surprisingly pretty even if the technical level of graphics is the same type as the previous series.
I mean, it's not the end of the world.
But driving through the desert, in autumn landscapes or in highly snowy mountains is very pleasant visually.
The tests are in addition, from time to time, embellished with an atypical element.
For example, in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm that significantly reduces your visibility.
Then in the mountains you have to be careful that an avalanche doesn't fall on you.
Next to this the different races are well arranged one behind the other.
There are only a few, but that is enough.
There are moments when you try to exceed the requested number of opponents (as in a classic race) then you will run against the time (classic duel with the chronometer) and then wait for another duel with an opponent.
From time to time you also have the police who enter the game and try to make the situation worse for you.
The novelty is the off-vehicle passages.
This is rather an interactive animation when most of the time Jack runs away from someone and you have to help him by typing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
What is surprising is that there are fewer moments of this type than you expect (to be concrete there are only three).
The result is quite the same because this element is not likely to interfere and is placed, in the context described above, in the elements that enrich the game.
The driving pattern is in the tradition of previous games.
This means that at present there is nothing extraordinary but it cannot be said to be negative.
As far as realistic simulation is concerned, you will have to go elsewhere.
But although one can find better in the concur the driving model goes very well with the type of racing design.
So it's all right.
The problems begin to appear after some time.
At the same time as the driving model is different, the collision model is not yet well developed.
We don't expect this game to cause complicated deformation and collisions, but when you don't have the slightest idea of how your car behaves in a collision with any object, it's not completely good.
During tight overtaking you sometimes touch each other slightly but otherwise your car leaves in crazy voltages.
Or you'll end up in pieces.
Thanks to the restart system this is not really a problem but it really annoys you.
The restart is done so that when you have broken the figure or you have come out in the setting the game will bring you back to the moment of the last point on the route.
But you only have 5 restarts.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to restart the game from the beginning.
So it's more of a tool, in case something doesn't go right, than something you can really count on.
Sometimes restarts do not help and the solution needs to be found by remembering the part of the route in question.
The big problem with this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain turns that need to be passed in a certain way, otherwise this does not pass.
Otherwise you encounter "civilian" vehicles in a given location always in the same configuration as you arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds early or one minute late.
What gets angry are the situations when you see the opponent easily passing between two cars coming in the opposite direction and when you arrive, you have to either stand aside and conturner them or brake them.
It is equal if you go in front of him because it is "calculated" in such a way that for the given situation it always happens very close to your nose.
Opponents still have other advantages.
All the time of the game, you, you arrive in certain places, again without worrying about the time, and you always have the same opponent that precedes you in the same place.
This is the most irritating at the end of the game when you ride on a long reverse-direction bridge.
The opponent must at all costs pass in front of you.
When it passes in front of you it hides the view of other vehicles in reverse direction and you collide many times.
We can understand that the purpose of this game is to do something captivating and full of adredaline, but it is clear that you are bored quickly.
And it's a shame because through a simple driving model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 unique routes, that the order of the races is such that there is no chance of getting bored or something else.
The original idea is to change cars during the races.
You should pay attention to the gas pumps on the routes because you can switch cars there however most of the time the one you have is enough for you.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are ideal for cities, big American cars for straight motorways and super sports cars with exotic attire on very technical pipelines, for example on yaw roads in the mountains.
And the fashion of challenges, which are races in particular places you know of adventure, goes very well with the main regime of history.
You receive not only medals but also points of experience that add to your profile, which is common to challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of driver, different objects begin to unlock:
This one connects on-line with the Autolog function which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides you with other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult strokes to understand is the situation of the last race of the adventure.
You arrive with your car in the tunnel of the subway (it looks like) where you drive in the dark on the tracks (it looks like).
Your speed indicator tells you between 150 and 200 km / hour (a priori) and behind you comes a subway train that sends you the car directly to the scrap metal.
In the writing we had a discussion for a few days about whether someone really thought when creating this game or whether the authors really think we're idiots.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is usually nice and in some cases really great.
What bothers us is that in more extreme situations, imaging does not hold the level and in some cases tragically.
This applies especially to accidents with a large number of participants when fluid imaging is no longer useful to you.
The sound part is good and the track is at your choice.
In order to please the greatest number and especially the young audience a new sound track was created in the style "I mix everything," but one can expect that no one will buy the game for music.
General Impression of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game didn't have these stupid mistakes we could say without fear that this is the best NFS production in recent years.
But this game gives the impression that it's not over.
The fun is really good but get ready for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the strength of an aerodrome reflector.
The velvet students in concert with the choirs of Charles University
For the third time, the Festa Academica festival offers festivities that link the International Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution with a musical part.
During the festival there are 20 choirs from the higher and secondary schools.
The festival's highlight is composed of two concerts on November 17.
"Charles University has an important part in this festival."
"Among the choirs there is the Choir of the Faculty of Pedagogy and Humanities, in the committee of the festival the rector Vaclav Hampl sits," says the head of the organizing team Jakub Calou.
The highlight of the festival is the concert of the Choeur des lycées et classes secondaires which takes place with free entrance on 17 November from 14: 00 on the space located in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the programme is the composition of the well-known Czech jazzman Karel Ruzicka, Celebration Jazz Mass.
In the evening the concert "Students of velvet" takes place in the premises of the National House in Vinohrady, during which the choirs of the higher schools as well as that of Charles University are performed.
The Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate with dignity the International Student Day and to commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the velvet revolution, but also to present to the public a choir music of the highest level and to develop creative cooperation among young people.
The main organiser is the Czech Research Union in cooperation with Jan Kepler High School.
All the action is under the aegis of Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of Prague and Vaclav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival takes place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
The program also offers high-level concerts, Msical meetings, student bonding and other activities.
Interested parties will find all the information on the web pages of the festival www.festaacademica.cz.
Vicenova, Ambassador to the European Union:
The Czechs behave like negativists and eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has radically removed the balance between the institutions"
"I didn't expect such a hard war."
"This will last 5.6 years before the situation calms down and all players get used to their new role," Milena Vicenova began her presentation at the Faculty of Law the Czech Ambassador to the European Union.
When she managed to describe the various bodies of the EU and their relations in such an understandable and visible way, to the extent that a large number of speakers from the Faculty of Law of Charles University could envy her, she showed how she takes her motto "understandable and openly about Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova paid tribute to the work of Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"From the beginning, the criticism that it is blunt, that it is a round of leather, that it cannot fill any mission and I must say that it has breathless to everyone because it holds its role to perfection."
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states, communicate well with them and has a clear vision of the direction to be taken from Europe."
She explained the new post of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Defence Policy as part of an answer to the question: "Who is who in the European Union?" "What telephone number should I call?," thus as an important step towards the uniqueness and greater readability of the Union's policy vis-à-vis the states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban our syrecky (cooked cheese that smells very strong)
Mrs Vicenova also referred to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency two years ago a success.
The Czech Republic has resolved the rising financial crisis, the gas crisis or organized a Summit for an Eastern Partnership.
She described the fall of greening as very negative and damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, "the activity has broken its full throes" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved still now.
In addition, we must approve the new EU septimal budget, which is becoming very complicated because of the current economic situation.
As it seems that the budget will be small and for savings, which branch will have priority, which countries will be helped the most, the least, everything has to be resolved in the context of future negotiations.
The Ambassador recalled her slogans with which she arrived in Brussels "For an understandable Europe."
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, jargon that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand, it is true that no one in Brussels makes round or twisted pickles, bananas that are different in size or that no one has forbidden us to make syrecky. "
It wants to make better use of the EU environment and see more Czechs in the European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the Ambassador the Czechs have the reputation of being Eurosceptics and people who see things only in their negative aspect more than positively.
Moreover, she is sorry to see such a small Czech representation in the European institutions.
According to her, the fault is the result of several factors, such as the timidity of our candidates, their inability to write a letter of motivation and weak support from the Czech side.
In addition to a successful Czech Presidency, she then stressed the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when the Polish, the Magyar, the Slovak, the Frenchman come to me, the Frenchman says to me:" Hey, what are you doing there, what is this Visegrad group still doing? "and he is not happy at all."
According to Mrs Vicenova, in the near future it is new hard rules on budgetary policy that await the Member States.
It is the concept of a two-speed Europe, if not at several speeds, that prevails rather than a "new European Federation."
"We have countries in the euro area and others outside the area."
"We have the Schengen area, we also have the institute for enhanced cooperation."
First of all, it was said that the countries that want it and those that do not want to do so should cooperate with each other. "
"There will be many such institutes and there will be a truly two-speed Europe," says Vicenova.
From this point of view, it also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the basis on which all issues with an impact on the EU should be discussed between all EU members and not just the memebres of the Eurozone.
History of a brand:
IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone were to look for the word that expresses the IBM strategy as closely as possible, the closest one would be "the long term."
For a large public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, is a firm felt as very current and however since its creation it has been a hundred years.
The basis for this long-term strategy was laid by the company's first leader, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr., who was the first to develop a long-term strategy.
He left this slogan that many global problems can be solved if people are willing to think.
His slogan "PENSE '!" has become the imprint around which the life of a giant future will develop (and also the title of the internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
It was the basis of the company culture carefully developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed towards the future.
IBM has survived a hundred years because it always remained faithful to its core values and yet was not afraid to change all the others around it.
This enabled us in our first century to transform technology, business and society.
We hope that in the second century we will reach even more, "the current director of the firm Samuel J. Palmisano deluded for the anniversary.
A well-prepared system
Watson, in the 1930s, began to look after his employees like Bata in the Czech Republic - IBM's people were the only among the first American employees to have paid holidays, an insurance paid by the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a well-developed system of rewards for inventors and traders.
Similarly, IBM has a well-developed customer relationship system.
Society was in the beginning great in the discovery of talents- as one of the first firms to have abolished any form of discrimination and thus had the choice.
The current plan is completely in line with the anti-discrimination strategy as it will be a woman - Virginia Rometty - who should replace Palmisano at the head of IBM.
She has been with IBM for thirty years and is currently Chief Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM over the past few years does what we call jamy, brain- storming online from which came many future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprising that he has a lot of ideas - in the firm there are nearly 500,000 people working.
An institution with a good name
It is the company's internal and external image that ensures a secure position in the business field.
"From the beginning IBM had a concept of an institution rather than a technology firm," said Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Professor of Economics at Harvard School of Economics and author of the book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technological firm but a firm that helps solve problems in the business world by using its technology," added Geogre Colony of Consulting Forrester Research.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Great Blue," as it is famously called in the United States with regard to its slogan- in a hundred years it has grown up to become one of the world's largest companies.
It is obviously the most versatile technology firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, hosting, consulting services at the level of server products up to nanotechnology.
It has many patents from all US technology firms and five of its employees have been awarded a Nobel Prize.
Among his discoveries is the ticket dispenser, the payment card, the financial swap, the barcode or the floppy disk.
IBM found itself this year with $220 billion the second largest technology firm according to market capitalization (the first is Apple), when for the first time it surpassed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview
Not all innovations and manufacturing have had the preference of the customer and of the time - IBM, for example, has not succeeded in betting on its own OS / 2 operating system, the online Prodige service or the IBM PCjr computer:
"As soon as your business is built on the movement ahead you can't emotionally stay on the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
For this IBM has no problem building its bases on many platforms and when they don't work it goes away.
Unlike, for example, the Microsoft concocent that basically stands and remains under the Windows operating system.
A technology perspective
In IBM revenues, services, which are trained for a fifth by software and hardwares, have a prominent place.
However still in 1990 it was with more than the motif of participation the strongest representative of hardware.
Starting in 2000 IBM sold low-yield assets for $15 billion, during this period it invested $58 billion in the purchase of forward-looking technologies.
It continues to invest and even from 2008, when for the first time it overcame the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiates according to the precepts of its first chief Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis also increased its investment volume.
Now it appears that IBM is going through the current crisis undisturbed?
The IBM share price has grown from 2008 in 120 percent rocket, the firm's net profit continues to grow.
IBM's logo is to change everything but not its values.
We can expect this flexible giant to master other crises.
History of IBM: From cheese slices to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machines) was born in New York a hundred years ago and originally had the complicated name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It was named IBM in 1924 - originally a trademark used by a branch of a firm in Canada and South America.
The basis of the future IBM was the merger of four companies whose history is linked to the 1980s of the nineteenth century.
They had technologies such as the old "pointers," the clocks that recorded the arrival and departure of employees.
The architect of the new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 presided over the company's Supervisory Board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the company's founder - Watson's ideas have been the foundation of society's identity and culture to date.
Watson was the head of the Kusk firm in 1952.
IBM, as its name says, began with the production of all possible machinery for business and commerce - from cheese and meat slicers to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson's leadership, sales increased to $9 million and began to expand in all parts of the world.
Watson was so irreplaceable to the firm that, after 40 years of management, his son occupied the chair of director, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction IBM began the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s the people and computers of IBM helped NASA to guide flights in the cosmos - on Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the flight on the Moon.
Meanwhile in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family - the IBM System / 360.
The classic PC that determined the computer standard of the time with the name IBM 5150 arrived on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese company Lenovo, but purchased Consulting Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to deal with consulting and services with high added value.
IBM's successful strategy over the past three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a smarter planet."
Its objective is the intelligent use of technology in areas that have not yet been exploited, such as transport and urban management.
As far as the IBM trade sector is concerned, a "Smarter Commerce" platform has recently been developed which helps traders manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a strong history also on our territory.
It established its branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932, the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM RT, there is also Brno's strategic outsourcing centre.
The Central Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also the world-class research and development team which is responsible for the recognition of speech.
Rychtarova about her unfaithful husband:
Ivette, you can keep that donkey, I don't want any more!
Darina Rychtarova (53) said, it's over!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years old) became bodyguard and lover of Iveta Bartosova (45 years old), Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
Only she couldn't wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not like my partner," explained Rychtarova.
When Darina Rychtarova gave asylum in summer to Bartosova in her house, she had no idea that her couple would not stand.
When Iveta after 30 days insisted on moving from Ricany, Pepa did not reject the singer.
And he admitted in public that he loved him.
In time Darina resigned, accepted her husband's affair and ended up saying goodbye forever.
Rychtirova is not interested in knowing who her husband is sleeping with.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separate there will be no wife to welcome him on the doorstep of the house.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to end his life in our common house, no one will put him out."
"He will no longer be my old beloved and lost donkey, but a man with whom I have a special relationship," let Rychtarova filter by showing that she has detached herself from her husband but that they only remain in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and don't change."
"My wife set up a wedding on paper and I respect it."
"The company goes on, I deal with repairs, the garden, real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I are talking completely normal, but we're not having sex," said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarova finds a new love, he won't stop it.
"We don't have sex and I'm not interested in where she's going, with whom and if she's having an affair.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with "Iveta and I take responsibility for myself," Joseph concluded.
The worst vices of women: This also concerns you?
If you ask men to determine typical defects of women, all of them, both of them, are able to take them out "of their sleeve."
Ladies and gentlemen, in the following lines you will know female vices who can pump blood from men's veins.
Procurement
Does your half make any remarks to you that you are dependent on purchases?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing a week?
Are you happy to buy and package at the time of the sale?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a vice.
Some women think they should restrict their passion for shopping.
But you will say, which one would resist the window lick of clothing shops, looking for pretty clothes for yourself and then try them all in the cabin (ideal of different colors)?
And although for most women buying is a hobby, it can become a real hell for man.
Just remember how many times you told your spouse he was waiting at the entrance...
Constant dissatisfaction
"I'm not too fat"?
"I need to lose at least 5 kilos of weight - should I start playing sports?"
"Do you like me?"
Don't these sentences remind you of something?
Yes?
So you're one of those women who are obsessed with their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop caring for yourself, but many men are allergic to the fact that their partner is still complaining about his appearance.
Strong sex does not hesitate to say that the more frequent these complaints are, the more poisonous women become.
Oder and cleanliness in the first place
It's like an infinite merry-go-round.
Wash windows, vacuum cleaner, clean floors, dust, strip the bathroom - twice a week.
You're making remarks to your partner that he walks with dirty feet on the clean floor, to the children that they've salted the sink, soiled the window in the living room, and that it gives you a lot of work?
In case you suffer from this obsession, try to keep in mind that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleanliness should not be in the first place in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness, however, can ruin your relationships and even family peace.
The work of sass
"Put that worn-out underwear in the trash."
"Are you gonna wear those old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel has nothing to do on the floor."
If you're doing this shave work on your partner this way several times a day, you're really going to break it down.
It is obvious that you do not think bad you want everything to be impeccable.
Maybe if the men knew, the women wouldn't have to do so much shave work...
Defamation, persiflage
Defamation, persiflage, but also insults against someone are also the property of some women.
Women are particularly involved in relationships and are thus content to treat subjects as who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us is letting go of a little harmless persiflage here and there.
The hand on the heart is, however, a special feature of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persevering, even despise others and are for their entourage - especially at work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek helped with their participation in the Philadelphia victory
Hokeyist forward Jagr twice took part in Philadelphia's win during Monday's NHL game on Caroline's ice and is again in the lead of productive Czech players for the contest.
From the perspective of 39-year-old star Claude Giroux, who made another pass and was named the best player of the game, he scored in both cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr, also scored two goals during the game.
Jagr after the match told the journalists across the Atlantic that he had warned Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game that he would give his hat trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes this feeling falls on you," Jagr explained after his action Giroux scored a goal for the Flyers' first shot.
A moment later there was a second assault on the Czech team.
Voracek fought behind the Hurricanes' goals for the puck and presented it to scorer Maxime Talbot.
One second before the first break, local player Patrick Dwyer made a descent, but the start of the second part belonged to the Flyers.
Concretely to Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he scored three goals, and then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player in the league, but he's really one of the top three," Jagr said about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of my career with a hokeyjist like him."
"I'm really happy with that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years at NHL the other players on the team have tried to play on me, now it's my turn," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this game because with a goal of Tuom Ruutu and again of Dwyer on a penalty shot she ended with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not rule out any other complications that ended at two to one.
"Pronger made excellent attacks in our area."
"He hit the puck, I got speed and (Read) went to the farthest corner of the cage.
"I tried to hit him and did it," described the final goal of the game from his Voracek perspective.
Philadelphia came with this victory at the head of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defenseman of Montreal Jaroslav Spacek did not finish the game with Buffalo he went out in the second third because of an injury in the upper part of the body.
The candidates did not stand up to an experienced defender their two-butset lead lost after a 2: 3 penalty shot.
Tomas Plekanec has not transformed any of their attacks.
It was the fact that the back line was sick that mostly bothered the local coach rather than lost chippers because they played the game only with 5 defencemen.
"It sucks."
"We played the game only with an experienced player, the rest were young."
"But there's nothing to do, that's how it is," said Jacques Martin.
"Replacement on replacement it wasn't enough and we couldn't resist."
"We just had to simplify the game, push the puck out of our area."
For this we had limits, "added one of the defenders P. K. Subban.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech defender, took part in the 30th attack in Winnipeg and the victory over Tampou Bay.
5 different shooters participated uax goals of the Jets, who stopped a series of 5 lost matches.
How travel prices have changed since 1989
Until 1989 there were only 5 state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
The travel agencies at that time offered travel mainly to the countries of the socialist bloc, because travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists travelled for holidays in East Germany, the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea and Black Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period 1962 to 1972 when he was allowed to travel to Yugoslavia then the regime began to have an inclination to the west and the trips to Yugoslavia were very limited for Czech tourists.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that it was not allowed for the citizens of the socialist bloc (also for the Czechoslovaks) to travel individually even within the framework of the socialist countries.
If the citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a letter of invitation, otherwise the individual trip was not allowed.
The travel agencies at that time also offered trips to the West, however, it was necessary to line up all night with a sleeping bag or to have a "good knowledge" within the travel agency.
And even after that it wasn't won yet.
The currency agreement that was the condition for travelling to the west was denied to "politically incorrect" people who could not travel at all.
However, the Czechoslovak currency was not exchangeable and it was not possible to obtain financial resources without the foreign exchange agreement (western currency) to travel to the west.
The Czechs most often spent their holidays in the country where there were therefore many country houses and cottages that the Czechs were buying and this habit lasts until now.
Since 1989, the journeys of the Czechs have experienced a great revolution.
Although up to 1989 holidays in East Germany and Bulgaria were at maximum, last year the Czechs spent 4 million holiday days abroad in countries all over the world.
The great paradox that we are not aware of today is that the most popular country is Croatia, where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
The abolition of visas in the 1990s of the last century in the neighbouring countries of the west caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovakians could not travel for a long time by plane to the west that everyone wanted to see for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris the travel organizations made the Czechs sleep in tents in the parks because our income did not allow us to pay for the hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of a Czech trip at that time was to take with oneself his own canned food, sausage, etc... to save money.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech koruna, which finally allowed our tourists after decades to be able to freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living and the average wage have increased, which has caused another important moment around 1997.
Thanks to growing demand for travel, travel agencies have begun to prepare tours with air charter connections since 1997, which through contracts have dramatically reduced costs compared to what was before.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had visa-free connections with virtually most developed countries around the world, apart from the EU, which later facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolution tourism, when was prepared the first air charter to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as every year direct air charters take Czech tourists to the distant hot countries; this winter there will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
More than 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development came in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU abolished visas for Czech tourists and allowed our country to fully join the group of developed countries.
Also in 2008 the Czechs for the first time in history spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50, 3%) and for the first time in history spent more than 15,000 crowns per person for holidays abroad including ancillary expenses.
The General Assembly must find its President but this may end in a situation without a "one pat" solution.
Almost 5 months already Czech football is without President and it risks that Ivan Hasek's successor as head of the Czech Republic Football Association is not yet known after a General Assembly scheduled to take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement on the voting rules to be followed.
Without this agreement it is not possible to start voting for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested in the Czech football management.
Hasek resigned in June and during his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who will lead football in the future.
Only during the era after Hasek the football went back to divergences between the chambers of the Association that cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was fully demonstrated on 16 September when a new president was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly met unnecessarily at the National House in Prague because the negotiations had been blocked and there had been no discussion of how to elect.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the General Assembly - only, it seemed, statutory representatives or staff members with full powers.
In this single point there has been a partial agreement since that moment with the help of the Office of the State and Law, according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
There are still differences about the rules for the election.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has also contributed nothing to the situation.
Opinions on the possibility of voting have changed several times, but the nerve remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed for the third round so as not to fall into the pat.
"The point of contention is either to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model," observed one of the three vice-presidents of the Czech Republic Football Association Dusan Svoboda, who represents professional football within the association.
According to the rules of the model envisaged wins in the third round that of the candidates who will have received the most percentage votes in the chamber for which he is a candidate.
Moravia is ready according to what is said to withdraw so that the candidate who receives the highest percentage of votes from both chambers will win.
And the Czech side is studying the condition that the winner should have at least two-thirds of the percentages of votes.
"Only this would then lose the idea of two previous rounds and it would completely deny the bicameral concept," Svoboda admits which understands the objections of the Moravian side and according to which the best would be not to change the rules and vote according to the statutes in force.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik also agrees, even though he believes that the settlement of elections according to the statutes benefits Pelta most among all candidates.
"I hope that we will vote as much as possible according to the statutes of the association."
"So that there are not yet any brainwashed ideas imagined by a representative as in the past General Assemblies," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is a candidate for the first time and who in his presentations defined himself mainly against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk there will be a new President and believes that the candidates will cooperate in the future together and constructively.
"The possible qualification today in the European Championship should calm everyone down."
"Football will again be on a wave of happiness and there is more momentum for cooperation," adds Jablonec's officer, who among the three has the greatest experience in managing football both professionally and regionally.
Rajchl is more pessimistic.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very tense."
"This is not a problem between the Czechs and Moravians, but there are tendencies to want to change the drawing regulations."
"This can lead to another blockage in the General Assembly."
"I still hope that good reason will win," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for a common agreement between all parties.
Some unions should take place directly in Montenegro but who can say if the entire football management will be complete for the match.
The specially chartered flight to Podgorice, including Vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not take off for technical reasons and a variant was being sought to take part of the Executive Committee to the field of retaliation.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which could take place on Wednesday, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very pleased to receive the torn parties within the strongest sports association in the country and bring them to an agreement.
In the game there are many: a state endowment, the credibility of football and also the General Assembly of the Czech Sports Union which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclik goes to fight for the position of President because he sees no correct candidate.
If the leader of the Plzen Tomas Paclik footballers had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to everything he asked for a new President of the Czech Republic Football Association (AFRT) he would not be campaigning for this high office.
"If such a candidate exists, I support him, I fight for him and I do not run for election."
"But in the current situation it has not been possible to find such a candidate," Paclik told the Czech News Agency (TKC).
Paclik's motivation is to compete with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl in an attempt to prevent Pelta from gaining access to the head of the AFRT, which would be preferred for this election.
Paclik also stressed that, should he win the elections, he would hold the post of President only until 2013, the year of a General Assembly.
He would see in the function an experienced and high-level manager who is not linked to the football world.
"I talked to people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me it was terrible when some told me they didn't want to be identified with Czech football right now."
"I'd like to change that image," he added.
What Paclik is said to be particularly annoying is the relationship between Pelta and the President of the Regional Football Union of Plzen Roman Berbr, a man of counterfeit fame who is known behind the scenes as a lobbyist capable of influencing the vote of the delegates' General Assembly.
For Paclik it is not acceptable for Pelta to occupy this position of President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there would be nothing new in football."
"And with the support of Berbr, who is a high-flying merchant, that would be even less favourable to football," declared Paclik.
What still shocks him is the fact that Pelta's name was pronounced a few years ago in the course of listening to an investigation into a corruption case, for which Pelta escaped without any penalty.
"I don't know what prestige Pelta would bring to football."
"And how would we be considered in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, who said some time ago "if Pelta becomes president, I sell the Plzen club."
In the event that Paclik triumphs at Thursday's vote, he should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the September General Assembly that had ended with a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go with."
"He has great abilities"
"He would be able to present himself, for example, as head of the representation."
"But as manager of the Association he would not be able."
"I don't put my nose in what I don't know," says Paclik who in September attracted great attention when he voted for the annulment of the Board of Referees with Ludek Macela who replaced Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik says he would be at the level to lead the Association.
As an example of his ability to run private companies, he has also been leading the Plzen club since last year, which, with his support, celebrated his triumph in the first division last May.
"I have the strength to change something in the world of sport and to bring a certain culture to it."
"I would restrain the influence of some interested groups who, for example, tend to influence the Disciplinary and Appeal Board, which leads to situations of bad taste," added Paclik, who does not hush his antipathy for Sparta leader Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonising relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, whose power to lobby high-level policies would allow sport to obtain more money from gambling tax.
"This is one of the key points that the new President should address."
"If this is the gambling tax as the political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they should also say where the money goes," he said.
Paclik does not take his current relationship with the Plzen club as something negative even though he himself claims that the President of AFRT should be "above the parties."
Pelta is again linked with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal."
I see no reason to pass on my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to come back a year and a half later, "Paclik said.
Pelta has promised new statutes for AFRT that should put an end to pat situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates Miroslav Pelta promised that if he is elected, AFRT will have new statutes that should end the quarrels over the election settlement in the future.
The official of Jablonec is before Thursday's meeting in Nymburk very optimistic and believes that the success today of the football representation should calm this struggle before the vote.
Pelta before the September election that did not materialize promised precisely to devote himself to national representation and to obtaining financial resources if he is elected.
He decided to be a candidate at the last moment just before the last General Assembly, and this delay of two months might well allow him to defend his vision of football leadership and present it in a broad context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and are waiting for a president on Thursday."
"They feel that this is the best time for someone to take over the leadership of the Association," he adds, but he is primarily connected with the club of Jablonec, worked for many years at Sparta and at the Union Executive Committee.
This is also why he has enough experience to run Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election lies a euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hasek.
"Unfortunately at the June General Assembly statutes were approved which were not perfect as everyone realized."
"If there were not all these different interpretations, we would have had a President since September," Pelta points out.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that received the full attention of the delegates.
"If I become President, I take it as a personal mission and am prepared to take responsibility for it if it does not work."
"This is a principle without which we cannot exist," Pelta added.
Then he tries, it is said, not to confront his opponents.
He stated earlier that he can cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl, whom he recognizes with regard to his legal training, and that he is well aware that his opponent-candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He hasn't attacked Tonas Paclik in a long time, but he keeps criticizing Pelta.
"He has been playing football for a year and has already had a few successes."
"His attacks, however, were not the most honourable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's also why some people now have doubts about his character," Pelta told his opponent, but remains faithful to the proclamations he made in September.
According to him, his strongest weapon is his knowledge of football from the lowest level competitions to the national performance.
She should be a football vitirn.
"And I would also try to finish all the business that begins with the Bohemian business or the continuation of the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so that we can get enough money for all football," said the Czech news agency CTK the 46th candidate two months ago.
He also added that his appointment as head of football would not result in any change of people.
"I should get to know all the employees," he told Strahov where there has been understandable nervousness since there was no management.
Although there were catastrophic scenarios planned with the General Assembly, he believed that the delegates would not go to Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is only one point of disagreement about how to vote in the third round we will manage to overcome it."
"Football needs credibility and it will only get it when there is a new leader at its head," Pelta says optimally two days before the day probably determining his career as a public servant.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership the AFRT would start working hard
"If current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected new President of the Czech Republic Football Association at the General Assembly on Thursday it would not please many people," he said.
Rajchl promises, however, that if he is elected, we will start working hard.
He wanted systemic changes and made the members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to settle the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by the predecessor Ivan Hasek.
"As President I want to take care of football in its entirety."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and effective youth football."
"But I'm not saying I'll do all this alone," Rajchl said in an interview for TKC.
"I am a team player and want to distribute skills within the Executive Committee so that each member can deal with a specific area."
"And I'll hand out tough missions so football can take a big step forward."
"A lot of people won't be happy because it's about starting to work hard instead of criticizing others," he added.
It was said that he would not represent himself as a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"About me, we know I work 20 hours a day."
"but I need to know if it's worth it and if I'll have people behind me who will constantly put me in the wheel and raise doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he was hesitant.
"Many people still told me that I should not give up because they would also give up."
"It's a trust I can't betray," he says.
What motivates him, it is said, is also to continue the work begun with Hasek.
"For the past two years, there has been a great deal of de facto work and I don't want to let it go."
"There are processes that have been launched that will have consequences in a few years and I would not like anyone to stop them. ', he said with fear that in the case of Miroslav Pelta's election the situation within the Union will return as it was before Hasek.
"I believe in systematic work and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't know how to do."
"Behind him are people who would play football in such a way that it would only be for those who have been chosen."
"I can be blamed for a number of things, but surely not for supporting someone."
"I try to be objective."
"I want to make football for everyone because everyone will be happy with it not only those who have been chosen
And he confirms again that he would be only a President for the Czech Republic.
"And if there are those who say otherwise, I am ready to do everything I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division should be divided into two parts, one Czech and the other Moravian, the victors of which would be in the first division."
"There would be no situation as at present with only three Moravian teams in the division because the problem is currently finding young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered the competition for the position of President, Rajchl cannot assess his own chances of winning.
"I always feel the support of the Czech Chamber that elected me its Vice-President and knows that with me there will be successors," Rajchl said who plans among his future successors to save tens of millions of crowns on disadvantageous contracts, contract negotiations with televisions and on the law on games.
On the contrary, he said that the fact that the Association was not united was a common mistake.
While he said about Pelta "that he is disqualified because with him the Czech footblal would lose his credibility," he thinks that the second opponent Paclik is a strong candidate who has enough to offer football.
"No one can question Plzen that he did a great job this year."
"If he were elected he would surely continue in what was started by Hasek and would not make any notable change among the people in the Commissions."
"He wouldn't want to ruin his successors," Rajchl said who evaluated his rivals.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
A jump in the blue
By Julia Stanek
UFO optics, magnificent swimming pools in Budapest: Who travels across Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after touring the city or taking a long stroll - can let his tired legs rest in aerated water baths.
A book shows in which swimming pool you can experience the most well-being.
When Iris Meder went on a search trip for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not be missing in his luggage: his swimsuit.
Stretched on her back in the water, she observed the artistically arranged domes, and swam against the Putten Marbles who were waiting for her on the other side of the pool and did not fail to admire the meticulously restored Art Nouveau of these converted pools.
If a covered swimming pool pleased her, she noted in her diary without delay all the relevant details about the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools were surveyed in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she presented them in her previously published book: "Badefreuden (Jouies du Bain." Münich's covered municipal swimming pools, historic bathing palaces in the black forest, "Hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
She led her "trips to the most exceptional baths in Central Europe" in 13 countries. Alongside Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
The 46-year-old German is a real fervent swimmer.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have much interest in sport but she feels attracted to water in a totally different way.
It is irritating that swimming fans should be content to contemplate blue tiles and accommodate the smell of bleach water while joggers breathe the enchanting fragrance of spruce forests or can listen to the merry birds of the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools should actually be so ugly," the Viennese said.
"So I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of the water doubly strengthens the architecture
A diving in a pool and volatile sauna oils - a factor of well-being in swimming rooms are huge because all senses are awakened, according to Meder.
And if the builders would have given themselves a little more trouble, the swimming rooms could be a real delight for the eyes: "Instead of a floor we have a surface of water in the swimming rooms."
"It is on the one hand transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the entire building."
All surfaces are optically presented in a double way: high vaults, multicoloured tiles, templins.
The small-format image volume "Badefreuden" makes a 190-page report on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historical well-being - it certainly gives you the urge to jump into the blue.
The collector Meder discovered remarkable copies during her research in Hungary.
In addition to the splendid wellness baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-containing water in a natural cave in the karst (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) as well as a spa bath filled with water containing alkali and (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászbereny) in a bottle-shaped building.
On the other hand, the heated outdoor swimming pools of Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views. While a roof of the Zürich bath has the whole city in its eyes, you can admire the snow-covered Arlberg from an outdoor pool of St. Anton: The Turkish bath is equipped with a window from which you can observe the animation on the ski track.
Perhaps the most extraordinary swimming pool design awaits swimmers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Ötztal looks like a UFO that just landed on the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open plateaux, while in the background rise the mountains of the Ötztal towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
the smell of bleach does not emanate from all the pools in the Meder collection.
Many thermal baths emit a sulfur odour, from the Árpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba emits a strong oil odour, which it is difficult to believe, to be in a healthy spa.
The smell comes from therapeutic alkaline waters containing carbon hydrogen that is almost black and its silt sticks to your skin as soon as you let yourself slide into the pool - a special spa experience.
During her quest for beautiful swimming pools, Iris Meder also suffered disappointments: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor outdoor swimming pool in Czechoslovakia, she was in front of a barricaded lot.
The bath designed by the architect Dušan Jurkovic in 1902 was closed in the meantime.
Looking through the window of the Art Nouveau building in red-white-yellow, she observed the growth of weeds between the tiles.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The Bad Wildbad Spa Palace.
This building has already survived three phases; one can discover not only neo-Roman elements that have emerged since its conception in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style that was added to it in 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the spa palace has remained the favorite bath for swimming expert Iris Meder - and not only because she is from Schwarzwald.
"It's already a great yield to melt so different building styles into such a great unit," Meder said.
With such a palace, diving in the spa pool is apparently only a minor question.
Agricultural speculation
German bank examines speculation on raw materials in detail
By Christian Teevs
Does the German bank abandon its speculation on raw materials?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to look into the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the leader of the group then wanted to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, the thing is clear: According to a study, 84% of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate on raw materials such as maize and wheat.
Two thirds of those interviewed even demand that the German bank and other credit institutions discontinue this avenue because it increases the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the order of the Foodwatch consumer organisation.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author Harald Schumann points out in this article that the speculation of stock exchanges on global raw materials pushes prices upwards and that banks share a complicity in the global famine.
The consumer protection campaign is in line with Deutsche Bank leader Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley act in the same way.
Commodity speculation was initially introduced to protect merchants from price fluctuations.
But in the meantime, the majority of experts share the view that gamblers have withdrawn from offers and ask - and benefit the very poor.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently from the American competitors: He promised to investigate the reproaches and said, "No case is worth putting into play the good reputation of Deutsche Bank."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining Foodwatch-Report charges.
The review must be completed by the end of the year, then the results of the Deutsche Bank Board of Directors must be presented - usually with recommendation.
At the end of January, the head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be drawn.
This could result in a reduction in the raw material market, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann builds its Image
Foodwatch leader Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time confirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "Speculation of rising food prices shows in a particularly drastic way, how bad today's banks are for the public interest."
Ackermann is the first banking lobby to be particularly binding today.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculations," said Bode.
"It does not matter, for Mr Ackermann, whether we are talking about hungry people or whether the reputation of Deutsche Bank is at stake."
Ackermann's awareness may seem surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the group's CEO wants to present a perfect picture, a few months before leaving office.
Deutsche Bank announced on Monday that the Chairman of the Board of Directors will not change what is foreseen in the Board of Directors.
He could improve his brand image by abandoning controversial agricultural speculation.
And with regard to possible losses, he has little to worry about - his successor will take care of it.
One in two would cancel investments on raw materials.
Foodwatch strives to maintain a strong pressure on the Manager.
So far more than 30,000 netizens have already participated in the organization's campaign.
Bode published the Tuesday survey, with which the Forsa Institute conducted questionnaires with 1001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Just 11 percent found it legitimate that Deutsche Bank offers investments for which bets on food prices are made.
Many of the bank's customers would also derive personal consequences if they learned that their bank was involved in such transactions: one in two would, following the survey, cancel all investments for which money was injected into commodity speculation.
43 percent would not advise from such a bank to their entourage, 49% replied that they would consider terminating their account to change their banking establishment.
21st house in Vienna
The Pavilion that moved
D'Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups, downs and a Happy End: the Austrian pavilion for world exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, was a museum in Vienna, remained empty and then fell into ruins.
Now it is open again and serves as an exhibition house.
If we are enthusiastic about a modern post-war architecture, its clear shapes, its glass hangars, its bold and lively appearance and its new building materials, which are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the pavilion of Austrian architect Karl schwanzer for the 1958 universal exhibition in Brussels is a good and famous example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion was once awarded the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its light and suspended steel and glass construction.
Construction is considered to be an important step in contemporary architecture until today.
He made the architects so famous that he also built the Pavilion for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW house and adjacent bowl-shaped construction in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His proposed pavilion as a temporary construction had been exhibited after the universal exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the South Vienna Station, was transformed, and in 1962 a 20th century museum opened -
But the building was neither physically nor technically suitable for a museum - no walls to hang works of art, so not a good environment.
However, it was used for as long, until contemporary art received a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building was empty and has become increasingly dilapidated.
Now architect Adolf Krischanitz has transformed the Pavilion, it now bears the name "House of the 21st century" and will in future be used as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening the museum Belvédère opened, to which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a stroke of luck at any point of view.
The new start was completed by Agnès Husslein-Arco, who became the new director in 2007 of the Austrian gallery Belvédère.
Husslein-Arco, promoted an art historian to a considerable career among others in her youth as an artistic skater, later at Sotheby's, at the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, she carried out particularly the transformation work with politicians and the protection of monuments, obtained private public funds and sponsorship and established the exploitation of them.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of sculptor Fritz Wotruba, whose foundation bears the same name, have been exhibited, there is a café and a bookstore, and a desk must be built there.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the realization Krischanitz was therefore the ideal interpreter.
Not only because he had transformed and extended the secession of Joseph Olbracht with sensitivity and had won the contest, but because he had studied at the Technical University of Vienna and for him the pavilion was "an extremely important place" where he had seen "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the original project, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost in generosity and lightness as a result of his move to Vienna and his change of use.
During the current transformations, there were major problems: the "building was" an energy gap, "says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façades were changed, insulation glass reinforced with glass fibres was installed and the roof was replaced by a special safety glass.
The beams of the thermal bridges have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled coatings have been rehabilitated.
Two basements have made room for the new operation, a light panel sifted between the house and the road provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - this is almost a new construction, but still the light Schwanzer Pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in a colour protection against red-brown rust.
And the movie theater is even exactly the same as it used to be.
And all this under close supervision of the authorities responsible for monuments and with a small budget.
"Often materials that are good and cheap had to be found, and that also pleases the Office of Monuments Protection," says Krischanitz and he draws attention to raw ground in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and transformations, the building remained flexible and light.
It would have been difficult with the Pavilion, "which came from Brussels," said Krischanitz recently, a typical story of "Drop-in-the-City."
Such an architecture is "always in the wrong place" and nevertheless wants to "awaken the good conscience."
But in this case the House of the 21st century is not in the wrong place, because if it is a lucky stroke of urban construction: around the Swiss Garden stands the newly planned "district of the central station," with offices and apartments.
And another lucky shot may happen: the House of the 21st century could benefit from the reinforcement of another building Krischanitz, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berlin temporary art center, and as he says, she is already negotiating with the city in order to get a site in the vicinity of the Swiss Garden.
Bahn plans a winter crisis package in millions.
The railway company has drawn up a crisis plan, which aims to prevent train accidents in winter.
The number of employees is expected to double.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train accidents and delays, the railway company "Deutsche Bahn" will spend more than 70 million more this year.
The daily "Bild" -Zeitung reported in advance, invoking an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of about 300 million euros would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and the rail network also in the case of extreme weather.
The number of internal and external employees for snow clearing of railway installations and docks is expected to double to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the docks of snow and ice until the start of the service phase and 90 percent of the track equipment required for service within four to five hours.
Two months ago station manager Rüdiger Grube warned the government and industry at a conference at the top of the train accidents that also occurred this winter.
Last winter the railway company had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because, among other things, it lacks reserves in the event of difficult weather conditions.
For example, many new regional trains have been awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways for years.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway company has had enough to do for years, since it has to have the axles of ICE trains checked much more often at the workshop, after an axle break has taken place on an ICE at Cologne Central Station.
The German bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties to the USA.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann there is news in the USA: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems of the Deutsche Bank were not already enough, the past of this giant of the sector is catching up with it in the USA: the Frankfurt Institute pays in comparison 145 million dollars (106 million euros), to settle a dispute due to the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgage documents.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator is charging large banks with a series of accusations about having encouraged cooperative banks to make false promises about the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized the risks.
These documents lost considerable value during the financial crisis and led the banks down.
"We are satisfied that we were able to find a solution to this issue, without the parties going to court," said a Deutsche Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank did not recognise any fault in comparison.
This is also true for the Citigroup, which has committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for US cooperative banks and intervenes in the event of bankruptcy, in order to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to repair the damage incurred by billions of dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first of their kind.
The regulator also took part in other major banks and in the summer he appealed to the JP Morgan Chase Court, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
As far as the issue of mortgage documents is concerned, it is "Mortgage-backed Securities."
Credit houses are at their base.
When the US real estate bubble broke out in 2007, this was fatal for a large number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Even though events have already taken place for a few years, at the moment it is blowing a storm wind on American banks.
Investors and supervisors have filed numerous appeals to seek redress or to punish breaches.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) triggered the largest wave of complaints.
She blames 18 major international banks, the two US state real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for having benefited in kind in mortgages of about $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank is also required to file an appeal with FHFA, which involves several transactions totalling $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authorities ask that Frankfurt pay "substantial losses" but without mentioning a specific sum.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the claims as unjustified and stated that it wanted to defend itself.
WARREN Buffett increases by 10 billion at IBM
Buffett, the financial guru, invests huge sums in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than $10 billion.
Until then, the large American investor Warren Buffett has always explained that he does not invest in IT IT companies, since the long-term development of companies shows only poor prognosis.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed his opinion on investments in this sector.
He had already had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offered services and computer systems for the IT sectors of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered a knight attack in the world of finance.
As a result, the IT IBM business grants itself the right to be called "Mr. IBM."
Because Buffett revealed today to the CNBC economic issue, that since March he has purchased IBM shares worth $10.7 billion.
Its investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large shareholder of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM never knew anything about this commitment so far.
He congratulated the management, which even during the economic crisis had provided reasonable benefits.
"You did a great job," Buffett said strategically.
IBM has been relying for some time on lucrative IT services as an operator of accounting centres.
The IT pioneer, more than 100 years old, offers both Software and consulting as well as high-performance business computers.
So far, Buffett had avoided technology companies.
He says he only invests in the businesses he understands.
On the contrary, Buffett is instead attacking the rail freight, the manufacturers of lubricants or machinery.
Its Holding Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 subsidiaries as well as shares in a series of large groups such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Rück.
This 81-year-old octogenarian took over from the 1960s "the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway and made it one of the most prestigious companies in the world, thanks to intelligent investments.
However, his lifestyle is modest.
That's why he's a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of earning money earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of Buffett's investment the IBM shares increased by one percent to the stock exchange.
"Big Blue," also known as IBM, has a total market value of over $220 billion and is one of the world's most valuable technology companies with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett says, he doesn't want to be a part of it.
Founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology," which would now be reborn.
The murders of eight Turkish nationals and one small Greek company in the years 2000-2006 had an extremist context.
Following this news, Turkey and the German-Turkish population react with fear and concern.
For many Germano-Turks, the spectre that had long been believed to have been dead has reappeared: since the incendiary attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no more violence comparable to this right-wing extremist context against the Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been mentioned.
The extremist right-wing network that has been detected, however, reveals proportions whose size is far from predictable.
"Is this a return to bloody ideology," "This was the title of the online publication of the Turkish daily" Haberturk. "
The newspaper "Sabah" points out, however, that one of the authors was said to have been a v-man of the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that the German authorities could be involved in the extreme-right mire.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted in a reasoned way: this weekend it called for a silent commemoration of the victims of racial violence outside the Brandenburg Gate.
It was only two weeks before that the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicians had thought of a ceremony marking the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
It was with cheerful colours that cohabitation was staged, symbolizing a success story.
The reports of some Turkish media have the effect of a slap: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article in the Turkish platform - "Haber X," which refers to the context of the series of murders.
So the German publication of the "Hürriyet" does not fail to derive from it univocal conditions.
"It's starting to stink," that's the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He points out that people were allegedly murdered, paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany through their work.
The action of the police was very critical on the German-Turkish forums and they had subsequently discussed the success of their research.
Why it has not already come to the German authorities' mind much earlier to do research in certain suspect right-wing circles, the authors are astonished.
More than one is prepared at least for rhetorical or even drastic means: "If the matter continues to be stalled, there will be nothing left for migrants other than self-defence and armaments."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The internal peace in Germany depends heavily on the quality of the information and the relevance of the punishment of the entire network," writes Selen.
What this means if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s explained well.
The photo of the ruins after the Solingen fire is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
For no other event has made it more clear to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat, and to the Germans, on which mistrust and distance through acts of violence could lead.
However, the attacks have heightened our feelings in the Turkish community.
Never repeat the mistakes of the past
In the past it was mainly the failure of German politics after the attacks which the Turkish press complained about: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire in Solingen he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish Head of State, was represented at the funeral in Cologne by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel counted at the time in his speech how many taxes produced the local Turkish population.
As if a man's value could be assessed on the amount of his tax charges.
The current Turkish media report shows once again how deeply the mistrust of many Germano-Turkish towards the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts to further clarify and re-evaluate extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, a clear message is needed this time.
The Zürich Lake scandal bank
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has almost gone bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since skated from one crisis to the next.
He's a German who's got to be in charge now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber had imagined.
After his spectacular departure from the head of the Bundesbank, it was discovered in July that in 2013 he would occupy a position almost as spectacular: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the large Swiss bank UBS - a big step towards an unexpected and lucrative career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoiced, welcomed; Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its recently obtained solidity and gave friendly comments on future colleagues.
"The UBS has succeeded the Turnaround."
"I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, as early as September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A securities dealer from UBS in London had hijacked all the Bank's security systems and had flared up about €1.7 billion.
The head of the board of the UBS Oswald Grübel, a well-known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the UBS has since been regarded as suffering - and everyone asks: When is Axel Weber finally coming back?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the administrative presidency already in May - not in 2013, as announced by the bank on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber this becomes difficult.
He is not a banker, much more a professor of economics and President of the bank, and he would certainly have needed a period of adaptation.
At the same time he took responsibility for the strategy of a bank, which has just proved once again that it has long earned the title of "Europe's biggest scandal bank."
Indeed, the UBS is on the one hand huge - until recently, it was the largest asset manager in the world, and on the other, it has been skating for years from scandal to scandal.
Nothing seems to spare the proud Swiss bank.
It started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007 the UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the Swiss asset manager, silent and solid, but also cunning, had combined it with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank in the field of banking investment.
So the UBS managed on one side in 2007 with 1.6 billion dollars more money from a wealthy clientele than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, she had advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world's largest banks.
It made an impression.
Former banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor for many years in Zurich says: "I have always taken the UBS as a model for good banking in front of my students."
"From the present point of view, we ask ourselves: how could I have simply been so wrong?"
He made a profound mistake.
In 2007 it appeared that for the first time something was not turning round at the UBS.
In the middle of the year President Peter Wuffli withdrew in a surprising way, which until then was regarded as a top intellectual as well as a great banker.
A few months later, it was thought for what reason he had left.
The division of the bank had flared with sub-prime documents and had to cross billions.
To support this, the UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs and crossed over.
For this it has indeed found investors, but who, shortly before, would have frowned: a non-transparent Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund, which was ignored, to the point that one never even learned its name.
However, it was only the first blow.
In April 2008 it worsened.
The bank was to announce again losses amounting to billions, and the Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, who was still Switzerland's second-best-paid Board of Directors in 2006, withdrew.
In October 2008 the disaster followed: the UBS was in the pre-bankruptcy financial crisis due to its investment errors and had to be saved by the state.
The national bank bought tens of billions of problematic securities from UBS, and the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for bonds convertible into shares, for which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - for it has noted how dramatic it can be for a small country to house such large banks.
Finally, the total balance sheet of the UBS 2007 amounted to more than five times the economic performance of Switzerland (see graph).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says Bank Researcher Geiger.
After the first disaster he followed the second.
Already a few months earlier, the UBS had capitulated because of a fiscal dispute with America and declared itself ready to publish the data of the easy clientele, who had defrauded the tax perhaps with the help of the Bank.
In addition, it accepted a payment of $780 million - in return for unjustified profits from these transactions with an increased fine.
Thus the UBS has more or less published that it had helped in tax evasion.
At the same time she lost something that has always been her capital in competition with the rich customers: the prestige of discretion.
After the scandal Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This followed the withdrawal of the head of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And from the exodus of clients' money.
In a few months, the bank lost its credibility in the two main business sectors: bank investment due to bad speculation and asset management due to aid for tax fraud.
And, as there was a bit of a return to calm, and as we thought, that the UBS would get away with it, it followed from this unfortunate story of securities dealers: only one securities dealer flares 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realizes that something is not going round.
And we publish: with risk management in an investment bank it still doesn't seem to work.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that risk management has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and professor of finance at the University of Zurich's Banking Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also sure: "the problem of the UBS is that it does not have control over risks in hand."
However, it was precisely the idea of prudence, with which the Swiss bankers had long taken office, that of becoming guardian of the great fortune of the world: not too great risks, but security for money - and the world could well collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The treasures of Swiss banks had become the symbol of unshakeable reliability as Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS power station in Zurich is still linked to the strong cliché of the private Swiss bank - it is only a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has its headquarters at Zurich Central Station, which leads directly from Zurich Central Station to Lake Zurich, which itself is surrounded by the snowy peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings are prestigious here, the rental of shops is among the highest in Europe.
Jewelry shops like Tiffany's, we find them here between the shops of Swiss tradition as well as those of the confectionery Sprüngli.
For centuries Swiss bankers have resided here: from the national bank to the Swiss Credit Palace to elitist private banks like Julius Bär.
We arrive in the entrance hall of the UBS by a heavy door.
Inside, the walls are covered with marble, in front are thick leather chairs, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe."
The UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank has one day or the other excluded from the market - or betrayed the two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He would prefer not to read his name in the newspaper, finally like all Swiss bankers he does business also with the two big banks.
The UBS would have become far too large, he found - especially in banking investment, where Anglo-Saxons would have spread in addition.
The Swiss would have nothing left to say.
"And even so, they have long adapted to the habits of Anglo-Saxons."
It was indeed the Anglo-Saxon investment bank that changed the UBS, it made high profits and then debacle: no European financial institution lost so much money in the sub-prime jungle like the big Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"This Wednesday the government coalition of the small country with seven million inhabitants undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes the author Lukas Hässig in his book "The crash of the UBS."
With up to 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, politicians have agreed to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If we talk with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of the UBS.
In June 1998 two of the three major Swiss banks concluded a huge group together.
A bank was set up, which was already too large for little Switzerland - and has been steadily increasing.
What helped is that the two different predecessor banks of the UBS have completed: a rich, but lethargy bank with as its strong point the management of assets in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more highly internationalised.
All of a sudden, international investment banks have had favourable access to a lot of money, with which they have been able to turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with the rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 Head of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, formerly Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said bank researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intellectual, who gets on very well in models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive, who has made his way to the top with the learning of the bank."
But Ospel would have relied until the end of Wuffli.
And wuffli would probably have made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," Geiger said.
"It's a tragic fall."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance arrived before the fall.
The staff of the UBS clearly remembers the meetings of the leaders during which the leader of the Wuffli group has always spoken the same slogan: dethroner Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on the planet.
She commissioned the League Tables the rankings, which documented the success of the banks at that time.
After all, the UBS wanted to go up to the top.
Some steps have already succeeded.
In the area of currency and securities transactions, it has played a very important role.
The corporate advisers, who were responsible for this, pointed out, however, a weakness: in international interest transactions, in the bank jargon "Fixed Income," there would be a huge difference compared to the largest banks.
The UBS would have deficiencies in U.S. mortgage products.
To fill this gap, the UBS embarked on an adventure, which almost cost it its life.
The bank itself and a management fund created before it in US sub-prime investments have invested in growth.
It turned into a massive machine that packed and passed valuable documents based on US mortgage loans - but also kept risks.
Even when other banks had been looking for a long time to come down.
"Still in the summer of 2007, while the US real estate market was in flames, the UBS bought there," says Geiger, the banking expert.
The greater the euphoria, the more brutal the fall.
One manager after the other had to leave, when putting an end to the attempts proved more difficult than we thought.
Posts at UBS have become ejectable and have so far been banked.
Whoever runs the big bank has an almost impossible task.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank, for which all the suggested business models have disappeared.
The bank researcher, Geiger already has an idea: to put an end to the investment bank, to concentrate on the management of assets, to return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank doesn't (yet) want to go that far.
But the investment bank has to atrophy vigorously, as far as is clear so far.
Next Thursday the bank manager Sergio Ermotti wants to present to the world his future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only supposed to be on a transitional basis when the bank split with surprise from its predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, it has become a reality: it must carry on the business of the UBS in a sustainable manner, the Bank of Zurich announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to bring the investment bank back to the state of progress of the mid-1990s.
He cancels 3,500 jobs.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber has certainly already asked himself.
So far, he only says publicly that he was going to look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.

Europe will not soon be able to recover from a recession, there are also other signs of weakness from the banks.
The legendary investor, Warren Buffett, has only confirmed this caution: "is not yet clear whether Europe would be strong enough to do something to end the crisis," he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, it was in his view too early to invest in bonds from European states and banks.

Smart crows spread into cities
In many places, freezes are considered a "bird problem." But experts claim that these very intelligent animals have not been driven out of cities for a long time.
Some love them, some want to get rid of them as quickly as possible. Crows have been in the city for centuries, but in many communities the complaints of the residents multiply because of the dirt and noise of the animals.
An antidote against the "° bird problem" is not yet in sight.
At the first ostfriesisch symposium on crows, experts said that it is no longer possible to drive the freezes out of the cities.
Experts from all over Germany have deliberated on possible solutions.
They're looking for alternatives in the cities.
The nature protectors based the problems of the cities also on the exodus of particularly protected freezes: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional vital spaces.
The hunting, development and slaughter of typical brood trees made life difficult for birds.
The crows are under the protection of nature.
There are large colonies with more than 600 brood pairs in the westfälischen Soest, in the northwest including Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a controversial project had won negative ads due to the killing of crows in the area.
Critics found the capture of birds in traps and their killing with particularly brutal gourdins.
"Normal eviction, eviction, is useless," said Leer City and Landscape Planner Werner Klöver.
The destruction of nests using pressurized water or cutting down trees, often produces undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahr at Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals move away, the large colonies divide and they disperse in other places."
Escaping is only conceivable in exceptional cases such as hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We are forced to live with them, we can no longer exterminate them."
The problem is not solved in cities without the inclusion of the periphery, according to the opinion of Mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concevable is a combination of animal escapement to alert packaging and catchy offers, to allow them to relocate elsewhere.
Psychologist and ethnologist, Uta Maria Jürgens explored "information panels instead of chainsaws" in order to establish completely different relationships with the: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of self-confidence."
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger-chemin-éducation des baseilles at Schleswig-Holstein, road signs informing about the lives of these very intelligent freezers.
This project has since been adopted by tourists.
Jürgen gave his own opinion on criticism of bird noise: "There's a lot of communication, these birds have a lot to talk about."
The intelligence and skill of animals are legendary: Freezers not only use working instruments to get to a treat, but they make their own tools as working tools.
Ethologists at Cambridge University were testing four freezes recently, how far the intelligence of birds is coming.
In one experiment, the birds soon learned that they had to crush a scaffolding with stones to arrive at a larva.
Without a lot of training, they definitely recognized that a stone had to have some size and shape to make the platform collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a smaller problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a larva.
Birds could not reach their booty with their beak.
However, the researchers had made pieces of wire available to them.
All four animals formed a hook with the help of which they fished the small bucket of the small pipe.
Three of the four fries are successful even from the beginning.
Cristiano Ronaldo takes Portugal to the 2012 European Championship
The hopes of a blow by the Bosniaks and Turks remained unfulfilled.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and also Ireland will take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland bought the last tickets in the playoffs at the 2012 European Championship in Poland and kicked Ukraine out.
Driven by the superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal lost its way against Bosnia and Herzegovina 6: 2 (2: 1) and made perfect, after the 0: 0 of the game, his fifth participation in the European championship.
The Czechs reached the playoff return game by Montenegro 1: 0 (0: 0), while the first round (2: 0) had already been an obvious thing.
Nothing was also more burning in the 0: 0 draw between Turkey and Croatia, Ireland took a 1: 1 (1: 0) break against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other tires for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga Wolfsburg player, Zvjezdan Misimovic, with an 11-metre penalty hand-played (41st) and Captain Emir Spahic (65th) twice made a shortcut for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic was confronted by a yellow-red map (54th).
Bosnia had already failed in the playoffs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa in Portugal.
At the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal had a well-measured start.
Ronaldo sent a free kick of 30 meters in advance into the grid.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his shooting skills at a distance and fired at a distance of 25 meters to make 2: 0.
The Bosniacs, who in the first half hour did nothing, had their first clear chance thanks to the attacker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger, the leader of the Manchester City English championship, initiated a headshot to the bottom of the crossbar, the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scored a goal for the Czech Republic
Finally the referee Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding in the center of all attentions.
After an attack on Helder Postiga during the Bosnian penalty, Stark decided for Schwalbe and showed the yellow card to the Portuguese (36th).
On the opposite side, Stark granted a penalty of 11 meters played by hand controversial after an action by Fabio Coentrao that Misimovic probably diverged.
But after the break, the 2004 vice-champion of Europe managed four shots and everything became clear.
For the Czech, Petr Jiracek also ended the last doubts during the 81st minute.
For example, the 1976 European champion will go to the MS for a fifth time.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg), was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the initial phase.
Petr Cech goal keeper prevented with a reflex a last minute goal by potential Tomas Sivok (9th).
Montenegro had its greatest potential when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of rotation on the repair surface right next to Cech's shot.
After the break, the crossing had to come to the rescue of the world-class Czech goaltender who had already been shot down, again, the CF-Seoul attacker had been replaced (50th).
The goal shortly before the end finally clarified everything.
Turkey was missing the Zagreb football miracle during that time.
Four days after the 0: 3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb could not go beyond a 0: 0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink also had to give up his place on the 2002 EM third-place bench, the Croats were able to rejoice at their fourth round in the European championship final.
In the presence of 31,000 spectators in Maksimir Stadium, the Turks had almost caught up with a dream start.
Selcuk Inan scored in the seventh minute with a long-range shot only the pole, attacker Kazim Kazim could not even bury the ball in the goal.
After the moment of fear, Croatia has increasingly gained control.
Even after the break, the Croats didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic of the VfL Wolfsburg, who was replaced by Ivan Perisic of Dortmund in the 62nd Minute, legionaries of the Bundesliga Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) remained on the ground.
Trapattoni participates in the EM
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first participation in the MS since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward took coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, which had already taken over with a 4: 0 success the first stage for a preliminary decision, 32nd Minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) equalized for visitors.
Ireland moved up a gear from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, before Robbie Keane from Los Angeles Galaxy received the first good opportunity.
Only at the last moment that the Estonian defense could have prevented a possible goal of the -first scorer.
In the 32nd minute, it happened.
After an unsuccessful defense from goaltender Pavel Londak, Ward was within easy reach and clamped the ball on the line for 1: 0.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China
The largest software company in Europe, SAP, intends to invest billions in China in the coming years and will almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Up to 2015, around $2 billion (€1.5 billion) will be allocated, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research facilities and development centres and hire employees accordingly," said CEO Bill McDermott to its clients on a fair basis in Beijing.
The number of employees will increase from about 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the global leader in enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP has a presence in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
Approximately 4,000 of the 176,000 global SAP clients are located in this expanding country.
China's growth plans are also an important element of the Dax Group's 2015 Strategy.
SAP plans to increase its 2015 bis turnover to €20 billion.
Last year, Walldorfer recorded a revenue of nearly 12.5 billion euros.
Currently the business management of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people, has never worked as well.
SAP has been active in China for over 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," said McDermott.
"° Our goal is to foster sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive information."
The slaughter of personal mass
Peter Englund's new book, entitled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War," begins with a long list of characters that shake your heart.
A tip to start with: carefully tear this page and make it your own page mark.
You will get to know these people in detail. In this romantic story by Peter Englund, this list of characters will be your GPS, a beacon during these few moments when, like one of his men or women, you will be troubled and desperate in the haze of war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which issues the Nobel Prize in Literature.
He has written here an extraordinary book which he accurately describes as "an anti-history book."
It has some known names, important treaties or famous battles; there is almost no ambassador or discussion of strategies and materials.
It is not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as a "book describing what it might look like." It contains "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and grief" summarizes the wartime experiences of 20 more or less ordinary men and women, from the two sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to escalators, doctors, paramedics and vendors.
Some of them will become heroes.
Others of the prisoners of war, some of whom will lose limbs, go mad or lose their lives.
Their lives fluctuate here like the candles of a church: while some are dying, new ones are being re-ignited.
Peter Englund's book departs from traditional history books.
He refuted the idea that the First World War was only a terrible trench war on the western front.
"Beauty and grief" skilfully describes other war theatres: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under hives; one spend Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an intractable problem.
This book is moving from the first page.
War invades the lives of these people such as a natural disaster, such as a hurricane Katrina that stinks of cordite.
When gunshots ring in the distance, and you're a housewife, are you staying or running away?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one can understand what happened, or even the reasons for this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of facts has been compounded by assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and grief" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German high seas fleet.
Their stories are mainly drawn from memoirs, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrifying or exciting, but are best preserved thanks to the accumulation of small moments and isolated details.
Most address deprivation and the ability to cope.
By telling the story of a German schoolgirl, Peter Englund writes: "Ersatz, everywhere ersatz."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He continues on alternative food in Germany.
He describes "meat made of cooked rice crushed in sheep fat (and finished with a false wood bone); tobacco made with dry roots and dried potato skin; wooden shoe soles."
He states that "837 licensed surrogate meats are registered in the production of sausages. There are also 511 surrogate coffees."
There are stories about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own drive towards savagery and says about the war: "You feel that after all, this is what men were meant to be for, rather than sitting in a comfortable chair, a cigarette and a whisky in hand, reading a newspaper or a bestseller, and rather than pretending that such a varnish is synonymous with civilization, and that there is no barbarian behind your stuffed and nailed shirt.
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die, and that no one will notice or pay attention to him.
"When one is resigned to sacrifice, one hopes to have an audience," he writes.
Unfortunately, it's more like "a convicted man strangled in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new types of terror.
"The conflict is becoming more and more a history of economic competition," writes Peter Englund, "a war between factories."
He grasps the arrival of what he calls "a new species within the bestiary of the beginning of the century: the well articulated and ideologically convinced mass murderer, in well-cut clothes, who carries out his butchery while sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly; there are as many basic behaviors as there are heroism.
Peter Englund talks about the soldiers who tried at all costs to catch a venereal disease in prostitutes in order to avoid service to the front.
"One finds the grotesque expression in the trade of pus due to gonorrhea, which soldiers buy and spread over the genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital," he writes.
"The most desperate apply it to their eyes, which translates into blindness for life."
In this translation of Swedish by Peter Graves, Peter Englund's prose is flexible but not ostentatious, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In dozens of short scenes, he grasps the way the war "unleashed exclusively uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, a social revolution, an aversion to religion."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are waging a war with them.
The best works dealing with the First World War are often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fussel, or "To the West nothing new," by Erich Maria Remark, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is an unconventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most overwhelming that I have read in a non-fictional work.
I won't reveal it.
But it is as if he had sprung up from his book, seized from your hands this page where the list of people appears and burned with a match.
After a first false step, a meticulously planned operation
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some wearing riot helmets.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation remained secret to all except a few high-ranking officers as well as others informed from the beginning that they were going to conduct an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the heart of the operation, with his presence highlighting the risks and challenges for the Police Department.
There could be no repetition of episodes in recent weeks, such as the use of pepper gas against demonstrators, who went against the department's regulations and caused a storm of public solidarity for the demonstrators.
The operation to clean Zuccotti Park from its demonstrators was deployed after two weeks of planning and training.
The police had prepared themselves by observing the activities in other cities.
A major exercise was held on Randall Island for the operation at Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive better anti-riot training - anti-terrorist measures to move large numbers of police quickly - to focus on the Lower Manhattan neighbourhood.
The last training session took place on Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders given to move around the park came "at the last minute," said a regular, referring to the operation as "a simple exercise."
"The few police officers I know who were called didn't know they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the anonymous person.
"The only ones who know they're going there are at the top of the police department hierarchy."
The city has learned a lesson, hence the secret of the operation.
On October 14, police officers wanted to clean up the park but were pushed back by hundreds of protesters informed of the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from various police units, including operational forces from across the neighbourhood - dozens of officers accustomed to particularly criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people went and came to the park during the day, like migrants, so an hour in the morning was a good time.
"It was appropriate to proceed when the park had the least number of people," he said.
Emergency service vehicles equipped with spots and loudspeakers gathered on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before intervening.
The lights and recorded messages ringing from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate the demonstrators.
As community affairs officers entered the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
No tent was hit until 1: 45 a.m. police reported, which allowed the occupants time to gather their belongings.
Other police teams were seen on the perimeter, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists inside the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the spokesman for the head of the police department, said that this was done only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police prevented them from observing the intervention inside the park, which had been severely detained by the officers.
Mr. Browne stated that the television camera trucks on Church Street, along the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
As the police moved westward across the thick business pile of protesters, including luggage, plastic grass and bags of sheets filled with clothes, sanitation teams followed, cleaning up everything that the occupants left behind.
The few protesters who refused to leave were dragged away. The images were broadcast on the Internet shortly afterwards.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the camp, not far from the center of the park.
Some have formed a barrier that the police have moved to arrest methodically.
About ten people at the epicentre of the camp clung together.
Finally, two people chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency services were called to cut the padlocks.
No arrests took place in the park until 3: 30 a.m. said Mr. Kelly.
According to the police, the clean-up operation ended about an hour and a quarter later.
According to Mr. Browne, nearly 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of them for "disorder of public order and rebellion."
Joseph J. Esposito, head of the police department, is the most senior officer at the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the detectives' department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "did not lead the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of police were waiting along the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary.
Barricades were laid on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, south.
We saw the police expand the perimeter well beyond Zuccotti Park.
Several officers, most of them equipped with shields, were even seen pushing people away.
Nearly 28 people were on the north side.
One of the busiest actions of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5: 00 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car. Others were seen killing the tires of a police truck.
At one point, a piece of plywood popped up flying from the crowd.
Finally, one police officer and one protestor were hospitalized.
The school workers' union is suing the city for redundancies
The union, which represents hundreds of school workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday for unnecessary and discriminatory redundancies. The impact is disproportionate on schools for disadvantaged schoolchildren.
The prosecution is probably the ultimate weapon of the union, Council of the 37th District, to try to have the dismissals cancelled.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, co-ordinators of parents and other employees, who are among the least well paid in the city, lost their jobs on October 7. Union leaders compared these redundancies to political revenge for not allowing the city access to a health care fund run by the groups of workers, which would have made it possible to close the budget gap last spring.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a Municipal Council hearing last month, Chancellor Dennis M. Walcott stated that the redundancies were part of the budget closed in June.
A member of the Council replied, stating that the redundancies of school aids were not specified in any way in the budget.
Officers of the 37th District Council stated that they would fill out a notice of claim, warning the Department of Education that it would be prosecuted; a press conference will be held on Wednesday to officially announce the prosecution of the case in the State Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis M. Walcott and the city's education department will be the defendant, and the complainants will be represented by eight women workers who have been dismissed, all of whom are black or of Latin American origin, as are most of the school workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokesman for the city's legal department, stated that the municipality has not yet been able to see the reasons for the trial and therefore cannot comment on the allegations.
According to a draft of complaints from the New York Times, the union would rely on the number of layoffs in schools in the city's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods to support its complaint against unfair treatment, stating that the poorest schools would lose the most support due to regular underfunding.
While there are no layoffs on Staten Island, and only a few in Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the 23rd District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th Districts of the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants at Harlem Public School 36, where 68 per cent of schoolchildren live in poverty, the prosecution states that "It is not a neighbourhood of affluent parents that can bring funds to fill the budget gap."
The budget for public school 36 was reduced by 3.26% this year, and funds were also lost when the city changed its calculation of the additional funding for each disadvantaged student registration.
The union also claims that high school principals could have been misled by certain terms in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parents' coordinators.
The memo used the term "overtaking" to describe the action, although "overtaking" more generally describes moving a teacher from a school to a group of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office.
According to the draft complaints, "sixty-six parents' coordinators were dismissed," and "not only because of overtaking."
Mission completed: Congress reaches agreement on Libya issue
Finally, it appears that the Republicans and Democrats have reached agreement in the Capitol on the issue of the Libyan uprising.
It took a successful uprising, the capture and death of the long-time dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the American involvement.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will have to take a decision next Tuesday, supported by President John Kerry (Democrat - Massachusetts), with Senators John McCain (Republican - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the Libyan people for their revolt and the American troops for their "courage."
"This resolution is about honouring the courage of the Libyan people as they begin to rebuild their country," said John Kerry.
"It is bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations."
Language may be harmless, but the debate on Libya has never been simple so far.
This summer, legislators from both parties came into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to approve or not approve the military role of the United States in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain presented a resolution to allow the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated by a large bipartisan margin and was never voted on in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed, the Chamber of Deputies also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of US operations in Libya.
The American mission therefore remained in a form of legislative purgatory - the Congress sufficiently upset to criticize Obama's management of the mission, but not enough to cut his grass under his foot.
The Congress's indecision has been overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under insurgents in August and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations "congratulates the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and determination for freedom" and "congratulates the men and women of the American armed forces and their coalition partners engaged in military operations to protect the Libyan people for their fantastic courage and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States in achieving an irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure enjoy the full support of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee or will it divide legislators as it did last June?
Senator and Commission Chair Richard D. Lugar (Independent) opposed the latest version.
His spokesperson said last Monday that Richard D. Lugar had not yet read the latest version of the new draft.
In the Capitol, this week the House must pass an amendment to the Constitution in order to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republicans in Congress, and some Democrats.
The measure, supported by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget, or any other matter, to obtain a floor vote in the House or Senate.
Other legislators have so far failed to get their amendments approved, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is one of the 68 constitutional amendments to have been tabled in Congress on a wide range of topics.
Some are recurrent - the same bill proposed to both the House and the Senate - and others are slightly different from a precedent.
There are at least 15 versions in the House of Commons only of the amendment for a balanced budget, and another handful that would "control federal spending."
Some of these bills are identical, but give their supporters - especially the new Republicans who wish to glow their CVs - the chance to boast of being "the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act approved last August called for the House and Senate to vote on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members wished to limit the number of terms during which Congress members could serve, while José E. Serrano (Democrat - New York) wished to lift the two-term limit for presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat - Illinois) has proposed a multitude of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other subjects.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage is always proposed, as is the amendment prohibiting the desecration of the flag.
Some legislators also wish to allow federal laws to be rescinded if two-thirds of states oppose them.
As eager as members have been to offer amendments, they are not as fast as they were in the past.
At the 111st Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 at the 110th Congress.
The pace is slowing from the early 1990s, when members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But these amendments were not much more successful than they are today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to Congress in 1789.
"Murdered but not beaten," says Gabrielle Giffords in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him at close range in Tucson, Representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat - Arizona) appeared on a television show on Monday night, sang Broadway's "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover first rather than go back to Congress.
When Gabrielle Giffords appeared on the ABC television "20 / 20" alongside Diane Sawyer, she struggled to form sentences and needed help to walk.
The show approached its difficult return following the bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of the brain, crossing the head.
Three months ago, she made a surprising return to the House of Representatives to vote on the debt ceiling text.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six people and injured thirteen others, Gabrielle Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult."
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41, said "pretty good."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, took place during a special one-hour edition of "20 / 20," broadcast the day before the release of the couple's new book entitled "Gabby: a story of courage and hope."
The special show has traced the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords since the January 8 shooting.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first few weeks, he is seen on his hospital bed, with his head shaved and a large scar on his forehead.
She can only use one or two fingers, with her husband's encouragement.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords sat in a wheelchair while the doctors taught her to perform simple actions.
A sign of the head.
A movement of the lips.
And finally, his first word, "What."
A few days later, Gabrielle Giffords whispered another word ("Toast") asking to change her breakfast menu.
The videos broadcast by ABC show the important role of music in the recovery of Gabrielle Giffords: one sees the Representative singing with doctors the air of Cyndi Lauper "Girls Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?. "
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, who spends two hours daily with the doctors, said she did not remember the shooting.
According to her husband, he was reading him an article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him and asked for the first time for information about the six people killed in the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and vigorously treated pending trial.
"There were a lot of deaths," Gabrielle Giffords told Diane Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
During her recovery, Mark Kelly told Diane Sawyer, she said "I was beaten."
"So I'd say," Gabby, you weren't beaten, "said Mark Kelly.
You were just massacred.
And you're gonna get away with it, get better and come back stronger than ever.
More pity than respect for the troops
The event: a gala on Wall Street to raise millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines around him.
The crowd in suit-tie stood at his feet to cheer him up.
"Military men and women are considered heroes," said David Saltzman, organizer of the spring fundraising.
A senior military officer present at the gala, including Admiral Mike Mullen, Chief of the Staff of the United States Army, saw the role of the troops in a different way.
"They were presented as a kind of orphan," the military high-ranking officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, just pity.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and a passionate but often distant American audience.
Praise is given to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, say some military.
The public is increasingly acting as if they are sorry for men and women in uniform.
"We are not the victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it would seem that the only way to support us is to lock us in the role of unlucky spirits."
This is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, who do not wish to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger of the troops returning from the Vietnam War was much worse.
Thus, most conversations about pity take place in complete confidentiality among veterans.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that the public would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were confronted with insurgents and travelled to distant areas.
Others would wonder if "an angry and violent veteran is hiding under the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to work for the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for a job, he said, he felt that some of the people who made him do the interviews were asking in a subtle way if he would be able to handle it under the stress of a demanding job in Washington immediately after his return from the fight.
"When you talk about service, you face negative impressions," recalls Colonel Cancian when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military arise, in part, from American indifference to wars.
The victories are rarely praised by a country so unfamiliar with the army and that sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value heroism in the same way as for the Second World War," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the congratulations of politicians and the people are largely focused on the depth of the suffering of a soldier.
Troops are recognized for the number of service periods endured, the number of friends lost or the extent of injuries.
The army in the face of increasing pressure to crack down on rapists
This week, a major hearing will decide whether 28 men and women will go to trial against the army for alleged inaction regarding rape.
If necessary, hundreds of complainants will prepare the next one.
First-class soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she claims to have been raped by a soldier.
It was October 2008. She was returning to her barracks at Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after having dinner with a friend, when she met a colleague carrying a pack of beers.
He asked her if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"C" was an alarm signal, "says Elizabeth Lyman.
But the Texane has put aside her concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas," she says.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after entering Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man grabbed her from behind, dumped her on the ground and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military personnel, some still on duty and others not, will be anxious to await a court decision at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether a trial against former defense secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will take place.
They are accused of not halting the spread of rape in the army, thus violating the constitutional rights of soldiers.
Ranked in February by Susan Burke, a lawyer from Washington, D.C., the trial initially involved 17 complainants. This number amounted to 28 in the following months - 25 women and 3 men, all claiming to have been sexually raped or abused by fellow soldiers. They also claim that the army did not investigate, prosecute or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Susan Burke says he's attacking the gallant military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? Leaders."
Counsel also states that since February, she has been contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of whom may be part of future legal proceedings.
Its strategy: instead of bringing all the plaintiffs together in this case - putting all its eggs in the same basket - it will start several trials, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defense, led by U.S. lawyer Neil MacBride, filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defence strategy, and essentially the fact that the army cannot be prosecuted by serving or non-serving soldiers for injuries in the armed forces.
According to a 1950 Supreme Court decision, called the Feres Doctrine, the Federal Government is not responsible for injuries suffered by personnel on active duty.
"The alleged harm is inherent in the complainants' military service," the documents indicate.
The Department of Defense refused to comment.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women still have no official right to go to combat, this distinction is written only on paper: the front lines of recent wars are rarely only masculine.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of women soldiers are playing an increasingly important role, particularly in getting in touch with local women.
As a result, 150 women lost their lives in both wars - two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the army to modernize, says Susan Burke.
She is not alone in this fight: three other trials are under way in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Centre is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly encouraging a misogynistic atmosphere.
On the other hand, the non-profit foundation Vietnam Veterans of America is preparing a trial against the army, focusing on diagnoses of "personality disorders" attributed to rape victims to give them leave - a relatively ordinary fact, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwaru of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit with the Veterans Administration in December, accusing them of discriminatory practices in dealing with requests for benefits for persons claiming to have been victims of sexual assault in the service.
Nine independent bills were presented to Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual assaults were recorded according to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office of the Department of Defence.
But it is well known that the number of sexual assaults is underestimated, as according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure represents about 13.5% of the 19,000 incidents that year.
The report published in March also looked at the percentage of prosecutions: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases registered in the army had been tried - half of the percentage of the civil justice system.
The complainants in Susan Burke's case described their assault as the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she informs the Military Police of the rape less than an hour after the incident.
That night, she said, she was asked to tell various police officers, doctors and commanders 11 times in detail about her rape.
She suffered a rape kit (literally a rape kit), and her assailant's blood - due to a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman sat before a judge at a trial in which she was questioned about her sexual relations with her boyfriend earlier on the day of her assault.
Six persons testified as witnesses of morality to the perpetrator, who eventually was acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was rendered," says Elizabeth Lyman.
"I thought I was going to start having contractions. I started screaming after the court."
"I was placed in a psychiatric unit, and when I went out, I remember telling my commander" It wasn't his trial but mine. ""
Elizabeth Lyman was forced to consult a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, rendering her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was returned under less than honourable terms, preventing her from receiving any benefit.
Will the Lyman case and the other plaintiffs move forward or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, Professor of Law at the Faculty of Law at the University of Washington.
However, he points out, "In my opinion, they should be able to move forward."
Only this doctrine criticized since its introduction is between them and a verdict.
I've always criticized the Feres doctrine.
The army is behind decades because it does not have the same benefits and deterrents of responsibility.
"The odds are heavy against them... but it's important that they try," he adds.
These things change only when the good ones have the will to fight.
If the trial does not turn out in their favour, Susan Burke, the plaintiffs' lawyer, will bring together her hundreds of other plaintiffs for further trials.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is reform," she says.
Or until we die, either of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers study you on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a simple guy sharing his anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to having been taken from a murderous madness in Norway in July leaving 77 victims, was confronted with his first trial.
While Breivik acted alone, he was far from being on cyberspace: he had spent much of the time before the attack on his computer, discussing with some of the millions of nationalists who support extreme right-wing groups on social networking sites.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
Easy... log on to Facebook.
"We realized it wasn't so hard to find them," says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a report recently published by the DEMOS think tank on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook is full of so much personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the site's advertising tool to find the people they're looking for with scientific precision - the way mercaticians have been doing it for years.
Jamie Bartlett's team discovered that half a million members are fans of extreme right groups in Europe. She targeted them with ads, but instead of connecting them to a new group or product, the ads invited users to answer a survey. The questions asked concerned their level of education, their attitudes to violence and their optimism about their own future.
By contacting these people through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview 10,000 supporters of 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leaving the office.
"This is a new way of doing research," says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising at all: the online supporters of right-wing groups are rather men, young and against immigration.
But surprisingly, "those who combine online and offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
DEMOS 'study is just one example of how Facebook has become the new and indispensable tool in the hands of scientists.
Focus groups, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all topics that affect health issues such as social trends, through "I Like," publications on walls and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, the "data supernova" generates an explosion in research, increasing the number of research works whose site name appears in the title by almost 800% compared to the last five years.
For some researchers, the advantage of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't approach on the street.
"Before, when you tried to investigate people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You were supposed to surrender to the party, but they would never have allowed you to enter," says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook avoids all this - you have direct access to their information."
Others said that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study by D. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and his colleagues, young students who spoke on Facebook about their feats in a state of intoxication were considerably more likely to be alcoholic than discreet students.
Megan Moreno suggested that students' colleagues, such as counsellors, could monitor the site and possibly intervene to help a student whose status would too often talk about alcohol.
"You can't deal with a problem if you don't diagnose it," says Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Megan Moreno and director of the Centre for Child Health, Behaviour and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children at risk, and who would otherwise not be recognized."
Facebook also constantly accesses information from its users.
The data team at the site studied statistics on the love situation and Valentine's Day, the turnout in the 2010 mid-term elections and a national happiness index (thanks to information only available - the champions of digital freedom have long argued that the site could make its data treasure available to other people for research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for being able to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of kilometres away, the site is allowed access to your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation they haven't even heard of?
While researchers have well-defined instructions on how to collect information other than via the Internet, it is something else on-line.
"I don't think many users have ever thought about a researcher being able to study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Laboratory, based on a 2006 study he conducted by observing his students' Facebook walls.
"As far as they know, exchanges were only seen by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without going through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the degree of truth of a profile or on a user's wall.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do in reality are two totally different things," says Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as a technological researcher, Neil Selwyn believes that a notepad and pen remain the best tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the real world and contact with people," he says.
"Social studies are supposed to address the social aspect - and social is not in front of a computer."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik's first appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who admitted to having organized the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance fighter" during his first appearance at the Oslo trial.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian Resistance Movement and the Norwegian Templars," he explains in front of a courtroom full of 500 people.
"As for the jurisdiction of the court, I reject it, because you hold your mandate as organizations supporting an ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit the facts, but I don't plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give him the opportunity to use this trial to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to let Breivik, who brought with him a paper speech, talk to the victims' parents at the end of the hearing.
Judge Nesheim also asked the police to keep Breivik in detention for another 12 weeks, prohibited him from speaking to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would closely monitor all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 relatives of survivors and victims were present at the hearing.
Some came in the hope of looking Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he would be placed behind bars.
All of them participated in the hearing to see the end of the trial.
"I found it cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya to Norwegian television channel NRK.
"I wasn't comfortable, but I personally made some progress after seeing and hearing the suspect."
With a dark suit and a blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the trial. He looked at journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the court.
Despite the strange idea that Breivik belongs to a vast movement of "resistance," the judge determined that he was not crazy. He also stated that there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
The attacks of 22 July thus seem to be the work of an extremist rather than an entire group of radicals, which may comfort some.
But this does not reduce the grief or confusion felt by the whole nation.
"I would have preferred it to look like a monster, but that's not the case," a relative of a victim said.
"It would have been a lot easier."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, at the cinema this week
After Steve Jobs died on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford - distinguished by the technical genius and inventor of modern computing.
But what Apple fans can find most revealing in an interview with Steve Jobs recently found and which will be shown this week as the first part of a film on the main markets, is how much this creative spirit had understood the processes and workflow of the products.
He was undoubtedly a creator and a dreamer. He identified himself with a hippie but was also very meticulous and organized, as well as an organigraphy enhancer - a man who believed that many business leaders suffered from "a disease that made them think that a great idea made 90% of the work... [but] a considerable amount of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the television series "Triumph of the Nerds." This series traces the birth of the computer, and he sits for more than an hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, Steve Jobs had had to leave Apple for about 10 years. He was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, aiming at a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of the interview with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copies have disappeared in the transport.
It was only after Steve Jobs died that a complete video was found in the director's garage.
This video, slightly edited, is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be aired at next Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Steve Jobs here seems surprisingly enthusiastic to exhibit technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly attentive.
On four different points during the interview, the answers come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, during which Steve Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts, in order to provide a precise answer.
We also discover moments when Steve Jobs' perfectionism resurfaces, where he seems impatient to hear Cringely's questions, giving him elbows to speed him up and move on to more important questions or topics.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, we find a strangely prescient aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assesses what he considers good or bad in other companies and shares his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read the posthumous assessments of Steve Jobs' career, but there's something crude and inspiring about the man we see here, the anxious dreamer on the eve of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
He explains them and then sets them up.
Here is a quick summary of seven remarkable sequences from Lost Interview:
On how he learned to run a business:
"During all these years, I have always asked: 'Why do you do things?' and the answers are constantly the same: 'oh, just because you have to do them.'"
No one knows why, no one thinks in depth about things in a company.
That's what I found out.
Steve Jobs goes on to give details of his efforts to simplify accounting at Apple.
Perplexed as to how the costs were recorded - one often starts with a "standard cost" valued at nose view, then adjusted with a "variation" - he developed an automated plant that guaranteed the precise calculation of commercial costs.
On the opportunity to play a tour of the Pope:
Steve Jobs tells the story of the "Blue Box" he created with Steve Wozniak - a device used to hack telephone networks and call free long-distance.
The device has been the subject of many prior writings, but Steve Jobs' euphoria here in his description of the Blue Box as an act of appropriation is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making one call and then connecting from one AT & T network to another while bypassing as many satellites as possible.
"We wrapped the ball of different things half a dozen times and you yelled in the public phone and it happened a minute later on the public phone next door," said Jobs laughing.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Box, we learned that we could create ourselves something capable of controlling billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We didn't know much about each other, but we knew how to invent a little thing that could control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Steve Jobs goes on to tell a wonderful trick that he and Wozniak have developed: he called the Vatican with the Blue Box in the middle of the night posing as Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to the Pope.
While several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two accomplices went out in madness just before the Pope himself was awakened.
About his love for technology (and Bill Hewlett's prom):
At the age of 12, when he hunted spare parts to make a frequency meter, he looked for Bill Hewlett's number in the directory and made a phone call.
Shortly after their 20-minute conversation, Steve Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a remarkable influence on me." It was the only company I had seen at that age and it formed my definition of a business and the way employees are treated. "
Steve Jobs subsequently became one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he discovered the "first ever desktop computer."
He was as big as a suitcase, he had a small cathodic tube, and I fell in love with him.
The teenager I was went back to HP and started writing programs for that machine.
On the Improvisation of Innovation:
At several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs talks about inventing new products on a whim.
At the beginning of his career, as he moved in to sell some printed circuit boards, a client asked him to assemble a complete computer.
Working only 30 days' credit, he had to deal with the assembly and delivery of the finished appliances.
Later, at Apple, he remembers the difficulties encountered in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember big fights... they were yelling at me saying it would take me five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and went to a designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could make for $15 and that proved incredibly reliable.
On the big companies that are falling apart:
Long before he revived Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated how many industrial leaders would be mistaken and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you were working at IBM or Xerox, you make a better copier or printer, and then what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company is no more successful.
Sales and marketing can change it, so [it is these types of people] who eventually lead the companies and product specialists are excluded from decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is completely rotten by people who can't imagine designing a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
She could have done ten times her current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They snatched defeat from victory.
On innovation as an artistic form:
"A huge piece of manual work separates a great idea from an exceptional product... as you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about his subtleties.
There are compromises to make... some things you can't do, electrons can, glass, robots, factories too.
You must keep thousands of things in mind (these concepts) by assembling them together.
Finally, decisions are made out of personal taste. It's about trying to expose you to the best products that men have created, and trying to bring these things to the product you create.
Picasso once said that good artists copy and that great artists steal.
We are always ashamed to steal excellent ideas.
This is in part what makes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked on it were musicians, poets, zoologists, historians, who simply proved to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If not for computer science, they would have done extraordinary things in another field.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health law as court meets
On the day that the Supreme Court meets in camera to discuss the issue of political discord, whether the opposition to President Obama's law of health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noticed at a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will defend the case before the High Court.
The event was held last Thursday, when the nine judges met for a conference to discuss petitions for consideration.
One of the cases involved a trial by 26 states challenging the ambitious health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that was a rallying point for conservative activists at the national level.
The judges have agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5: 30 is expected next March, and the result is likely to help destabilize the 2012 presidential race, which will be booming when the court's decision is rendered.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue about the rejection of the law is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as United States Solicitor General during the administration of George W. Bush.
The law firm of Clément, PLLC Bancroft, was one of the two dozen law firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which presents a huge financial challenge to the outcome of the dispute.
Dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
Among other things, Mitch McConnell, the Senate's top Republican and declared opponent of the health law.
The star guests at dinner?
This is not new: both judges have been present at the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing wrong with the rules of ethics.
In fact, judges are exempt from a code of conduct that governs the actions of federal judges.
If they were, they would probably argue with Canon 4C's code, which states: "A judge may attend fund-raising of law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, guest of honour, or on the program of such an event."
Nevertheless, the mere presence of Scalia and Thomas in the vicinity of two of the law firms of the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest, was enough to alarm the activists of government ethics.
"This breach of ethics and superb indifference to the code contradicts the statements of several judges that the Court respects the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dining and collecting gala funds with lawyers who have cases pending before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fund-raising of this event dispels any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little regard for critics claiming that they too easily mix court affairs with the agendas of groups such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginni, is a high profile conservative activist.
On the other hand, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a solicitor general of Obama's administration when the first objections to the law were brought to the level of the court of first instance.
Her critics pressured Kagan to resist hearing the case, saying that she had invested too much in defending the law to be impartial.
Kagan gave no indication that she would.
Boeing records record order of $18 billion for airline aircraft
The Emirates airline orders 50 Boeing 777, two-way airliners, with the possibility of buying 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, an estimated market of over $1 billion.
There is nothing extraordinary about a company receiving an order contemplating 50 of its products.
It is, however, quite a matter when the company in question is the manufacturer of Boeing aircraft and the amount of these 50 aircraft reaches a record $18 billion.
Equally incredible is who Boeing received this order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In forecasts released on Monday, the Chicago company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need 2,520 aircraft worth a total of $450 billion over the next 20 years.
During the weekend, Boeing informed of the most expensive commercial aircraft order in its history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-corridors.
It was the Emirates airline based in Dubai that placed this pharaonic order.
Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that the airline is also likely to purchase 20 more aircraft, raising the total order amount to $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing indicated on Monday that Oman Air has ordered six Boeing 787-8, dubbed Dreamliners, a model that boasts significant savings in fuel and passenger amenities.
The amount of these six aircraft amounts to more than $1 billion.
"This is clearly very positive for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"These customers in particular have immense value."
In the Middle East, oil-producing countries own many of their airlines.
They therefore have the means not only to pay for these planes, but also to raise the price of fuel - usually detrimental to the airlines because it represents their most important costs - would not be so harmful to them since the country would earn money with the rise in the price of oil.
This is an important point because these companies will be less likely than others to cancel or defer their aircraft orders when the price of oil increases, said Dihora.
"They have natural risk coverage," he said.
Emirates' order reinforces Boeing's dominance in the big-lift aircraft market and helps to stop Airbus's attempt to encroach on its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory at the aircraft show comes four months after Airbus announced that it will postpone the debut of the largest version of the A350, which competes directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus is pushing back its beginnings to increase the push in response to its customers' demand to increase its load capacity and autonomy.
Boeing's shares increased 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexican president is clearly beaten in the Michoacán elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped his opponent Fausto Vallejo of PRI in the race for governor.
President Felipe Calderon's sister seems to have lost her attempt to become governor of Michoacán during violent elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers favored one of her opponents.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, led the race for governor of this western state.
"The involvement of organised crime throughout the voting process and especially yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon reported on the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They threatened our candidates, our election officers... they took ballot boxes, set up roadblocks... and forced people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI governed Mexico for seventy years until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But he is organizing his return, and a victory in Michoacán is an important step in this effort.
The PRI hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have distinguished himself only from a few Calderon, who was at the top of the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate for his brother's Conservative Party, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the office of governor, came third, a painful defeat before the 2012 presidential elections for this divided and unhappy left.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the initial results.
Vallejo, former mayor of Morelia, the state capital, denied any connection with drug traffickers and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in trafficking in marihuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
This is the state of origin of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive against traffickers in December 2006.
Yet violence persisted.
A week before the elections, a PAN mayor was murdered while campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates gave up the campaign locally for fear.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as the Michoacán elections look, a victory will help the party in its momentum.
The man expected to represent the PRI in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraging in view of next year."
BASD urges Asia to help the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has asked India and China to prepare to help the euro area emerge from the sovereign debt crisis in order to avoid a long-term decline that would prevent the development of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, the Director General of the BASD based in Manila, said that the two fastest growing economic powers in the world must "do everything in their power" to speed up the recovery of the currency area through the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) not to look at Europe's difficulties with "indifferent eyes" and pointed out that Asian financial support alongside Europe's leaders and resources would prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We are all together in this crisis."
"Therefore anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful," he told the Financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected to a certain extent, but it is not safe."
"So if China and India can help, let nothing stop them."
In recent months, the euro area has been seriously shaken by a sovereign debt crisis.
Recently, the cost of the Italian loan has soared dangerously and the Prime Ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The burgeoning sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that the global economy will return to recession, and has prompted the call of the major emerging economies to come together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that the IMF would deliver any Asian aid, but he also said that this bilateral assistance - like buying bonds from the US financial rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater negotiating power to Europe's Asian partners.
India's Minister of Trade and Industry, Anand Sharma, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the euro area as its own economy is now suffering from a decline in exports and a dwindling flow of foreign capital.
"No one wants the euro area to remain unstable and agitated," he said.
"We have monumental challenges to face and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where would we find work for the tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies such as India should not help Europe's rich as they face their own important economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to get 1.2 billion Indians in Europe, of whom at least 800,000 live on $2 a day or less.
"One day they'll find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and they're going on vacation in the sun and they'll have trouble swallowing it," he said.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep many well-paid Greek civil servants in poorly managed jobs that generate losses, such as in the rail sector.
Mr Nag said that the euro area crisis could cause "significant repercussions" across Asia.
The BASD forecasts of 7.5% economic growth in Asia in 2011 / 2012 now face "risk of loss" due to the European threat.
He noted that vulnerable emerging markets needed to "develop relief plans" to protect themselves from economic spillover and large capital flight.
Severe Pentagon Warnings on Potential Reductions in Defence
The Secretary of Defense, Leon Panetta, put pressure on the Congress on Monday, warning that the imminent automatic budget cuts would undermine national security. He triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the battlefields of Afghanistan, through civilian gatherings.
The Pentagon is already providing $450 billion in reductions for the next decade, but is now concerned that an additional $600 or more of cuts will be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He said that Congress's failure to reach a budgetary agreement resulting in so-called sequestration would result in 23% reductions and the freezing of many new projects.
"Such a large reduction, so applied indiscriminately, would make most of our ships and construction projects unexecutable - you cannot buy three quarters of a ship or building - and seriously undermine other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to separate from a number of our civilian personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, we would almost certainly have to send civilians off without pay in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would undermine the faith of those who support our military and seriously damage our preparation."
The reductions would eventually affect the fighting troops, continues Panetta.
"Although the financing in time of war of contingency accounts abroad is not directly affected by the sequestration, war efforts would be negatively affected by the serious disruptions in the core budgets," Panetta warned.
"Contracting staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in contracts and supervision of contracts that support the war."
"Wage management staff would be reduced, leading to delays in payment to war suppliers, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days earlier, asking for details on the potential impact of automatic cuts on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequestration of the Department of Defense would have triggered a rapid decline of the United States as the undisputed world leader of military power."
"We are fiercely opposed to this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when Panetta's letter was published.
"This is not a consequence with which we can live, and it is certainly not the one we should impose on ourselves."
"Seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not have to happen."
That Panetta's letter and recent senators' warnings increase pressure for a budget compromise or a call to exempt the Pentagon from reductions, remains to be seen.
Panetta has been more and more virulent about possible cuts, even though he himself has reached the highest position of the Pentagon with years of budget expertise in Congress and the White House and knowing that he was faced with difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a dark picture of what might happen - a soldier with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without bullets."
"It's a fighter aircraft, without enough trained pilots."
"It is a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs that do not have enough trained soldiers capable of carrying out the mission," Panetta said in his opening remarks to the Pentagon.
"It is a depressed force, ill-prepared and unable to face potential opponents."
"De facto, she calls for aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta specifically stated how further reductions could "generate significant operational risks: delay in responding to crises, conflicts and disasters; severe limitations on our ability to deploy and engage in the world; and unacceptable risk in future combat operations."
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could be cut off, including those already tested and some just in the early stages of planning.
The list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a planned new bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new field vehicle, which would replace the Army and Navy Humvee.
Stopping the development and testing of the F35 could generate $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is a critical step in improving and responding to potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to spot a lie
A look at recent headlines shows how widespread deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging allegations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
Penn State administrators were charged with perjury for allegedly covering reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught by an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York Congressman Anthony Weiner, who is famous for the Internet, has turned out to be an idiot by quickly issuing denials contradicted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with violations of campaign funding related to the coverage of an extramarital affair.
And then, none of the people who lived history will ever forget the media circus that President Bill Clinton started by lying during his second term about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky.
The stories of cheating at the school and university tests are legion.
There have been instances in which teachers gave test responses to students in order to gain insight into their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send the message that lies and cheating are acceptable.
How many deception do we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 lies.
In fact, many of these are pious lies.
Another study showed that foreigners lie three times in the first 10 minutes of their encounter.
Detecting or detecting lies is an essential skill that everyone must acquire, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game similar to, say, charades, where the goal is to shout: "I got you," the detection of deception is a serious branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades in prestigious universities that have conducted in-depth research on such projects, particularly in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the oldest myths about lying have been demystified.
Liars look you in the eye.
They don't stutter, blush, or shake.
Do not conclude that liars are difficult to detect and difficult to unmask.
A qualified lie detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the statement, facial micro-expressions, question formation and response time.
I have spent several years examining scientific results in the vast body and still emerging from knowledge about deception, and it is clear that detection of deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful for navigating our complex world - especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, negotiating, or managing.
Good liars are able to read others well, making them comfortable, managing their own emotions and intuitively detecting how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more lies "focused on them" while women say more lies "focused on others" - usually to protect someone's feelings - that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tell tend to be huge).
We also know that if you are perceived as a disbeliever, the others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How can you tell if someone's lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "establishing benchmarks."
This helps to provide a reference point for measuring future changes.
Observe the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocal quality.
You need to know if someone is normally stirring their feet permanently so that you don't make unfair accusations when you see them stirring their feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for clues of verbal and non-verbal deceptive behaviour.
Consider these clues as red flags, not evidence of deception.
The deceitful people can immobilize the top of their body when they try to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, lean towards an exit, change posture significantly or present a relief of "post-interview" - an exaggerated sigh of relief, a change of posture when all the difficult questions have passed.
Interviewers often falsely indicate that the interview is completed just to try to trigger the post-interview reaction.
Also, pay attention to your subject's vocabulary.
The famous Scott Peterson skirted using the past while claiming that his murdered wife was alive, triggering a national search to find her.
The deceptive individuals can also use a distant language: "I did not have sex with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "wood tongue" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... if I remember well... to my knowledge."
This makes the answer perceptive rather than factual and is often a red flag.
There is no magic formula for detecting lies, but the development of skills to recognize deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding victimization by scammers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan will be diverted after US threat of late approval
A few days after Obama's administration threatened to delay approval of a pipeline project between Canada and the Gulf of Mexico - arousing union anger while soothing environmentalists - the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is ready to redirect the project to get it back on track.
TransCanada stated on Monday night that it will move the projected pipeline out of the environmentally sensitive area of the Nebraska dunes, and is confident that the project will still win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada's official, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that it will eventually obtain approval for a pipeline, but with a different route.
This follows the announcement by the State Department last week that it would delay its decision to grant a federal permit for the project until it receives further studies of potential routes to avoid the areas of the Nebraska dunes and the Ogallala aquifer, large groundwater sources.
"This is a real way forward," says Lee Terry, a Nebraska Republican at Fox News.
The new environmental review commissioned by the State Department would probably have delayed any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, although officials deny the involvement of politics in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 2,735 km pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would transport 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to Texas refineries.
To do so, it would have to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have relied on the estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But the lawmakers of Nebraska opposed this plan are pressing that a law force the remoteness of the Sand Hills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The Department of State's current environmental impact assessment found that the project would pose only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's Inspector General ordered a separate investigation of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is that a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a campaign advisor to Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent a conflict of interest for the program.
The other question is whether a company that was hired to conduct the initial study was an inappropriate choice because of its relationship with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a young child to vomit from fear
A New York-based family claims that the diva Disco Patti LaBelle, thrown into a rampage of violence in the lobby of their Manhattan building, terrified their little girl to the point where she threw up with fear.
The tirade of the singer "Lady Marmalade" scared the 18-month-old Geneviève Monk to the point that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased fear of strangers," his family said during the Manhattan Supreme Court trial.
It was November 10 of last year when stage technician Kevin Monk, his kindergarten teacher wife, Roseanna, and Geneviève were preparing to go on a family trip.
As Kevin Monk went to pick up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the lobby of their building on Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Geneviève in his arms.
Roseanna Monk said that she stopped by the door and put her daughter down for a while.
"Someone came behind me and said," Do you know what your daughter is doing? "I said," Yes, "and I went to get her," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman with anger.
"She said aggressively," You shouldn't leave your daughter by the door, "said Roseanna Monk.
"I said," I'm not interested in what you say or think. "
She became angry and began to use swearing - the word "" and the word "" with a loud voice...
She had a bottle of water and started spraying me with water from the bottle.
She said that at this point, Geneviève has become hysterical.
"I said to this woman," Look what you did to my daughter, "said the child's mother.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother - who always held Geneviève in her arms - and had to be held by her entourage who dragged her to a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she started to vomit, she adds.
Later, the family sent a note requesting an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives did not return our calls to comment.
The complaint claims unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis stated that he took the case for free and that the family is considering donating all the money received to a cancer charity for children.
"The goal is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his conduct," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old child."
Climate adversity has slowed down the economy
In the first year of Mario López Valdez's management, in Sinaloa unemployment and informality have increased, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled of change, that generated high expectations regarding the advances of the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, the increase is not observed, in exchange there is a deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, apart from causing billions of losses for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the state economy for growth, caused a contraction of economic activity in general by 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historical decline of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the frost allocation report issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were 582 million 835 hectares of crop damage, of which a 78.03 per cent suffered total damage and the remainder 21.07 per cent suffered partial damage, the main affected crops were vegetables, maize and chickpeas.
The decline in economic activity generated, until November, a constant increase in unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, the rate of unemployment of the State during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated increase, since while from January to March 55,053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 per cent of the Active Economic Population, in the second quarter the rate became 5.28 per cent and from July to September the average continued to increase to 6.19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase compared to the first half of 18,969 persons.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, according to economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly according to the actions carried out by public policy.
"What we see is an increase in unemployment that is due to various factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in Congress to combat money laundering, because it is not easy for people who earn dollars illegally to work to earn them, invest them and use them in something," he says.
Detained migration
López Cervantes reported that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who leave the state to go to work abroad in the United States has been limited, first because of the difficulties of entry and second because they already have a lot of difficulty in finding work, these people stay here and ask for sources of work, which means that unemployment is rising," he said.
Lack of seriousness
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market worsens by considering the high level of lack of seriousness that predominates between working conditions, according to INEGI, the 60.38 per cent of the population employed in this state works there without contributing as a worker at any social insurance institution.
Apart from unemployment and lack of seriousness, another reason for lag for the state are low wages, the entity has lower remuneration of the Country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Insurance and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Forecasting.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was 5,352 pesos, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos, until September.
FDI contraction
Apart from the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, in 2011 the largest reduction in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June, the FDI of the State reached 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars recorded in the same period of the previous year.
In turn, the Economic Development Secretariat of the Government of the State records a total investment of 17,280 trillion pesos per year, recorded mainly by the companies of the tertiary sector.
Debt
In view of the scenario of economic contraction, the Government of the State applied to the public congress in July for approval of a credit of 3 trillion pesos, intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municiens, with the objective of reactivating the economy, the approval of the congress of the State was 2,600 trillion pesos and until November no profit of indebtedness was observed in any sector of the economy of the State.
Reactions
For representatives of the employers' sector, Mario López Valdés' first year of government shows a lack of management capacity in the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was no harmonization of the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the land we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have had to align the effort of all and above all the already synchronized good progress of this new government team, hopefully next year is much better," he said.
Economic Lender
Loredo López stated that events such as the frosts of the beginning of the year held back the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flux is produced by several events, between which frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we close much below the expectations we had," he says.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronale Confederation of the Mexican Republic of Sinaloa said that the state is to be channelled towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general terms we have observed that we have worked, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocation and economic direction of the state, because it is important that the full potential of the material and human resources of Sinaloa be exhausted," he says.
Much to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that better channeled the Government's efforts.
"In general terms, I would say that the Government has made efforts to deliver good results in various areas, in terms of economic development there are some advances, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in the way public policy is managed.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, what I can say is that much has been done and the Government is aware that there is still much to do," he says.
Convicted for 8 kilos of marihuana
One resident in Novolato was sentenced to five years in prison and a fine of 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marihuana.
The Attorney General of the Republic has informed that the small trafficker convicted is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for a crime against health, in his variant of possession of marihuana destined for sale.
In accordance with AP / SIN / CLN / 687 / 2010 / M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by Mexican Army agents on 7 June 2010 during a surveillance operation in Cipriano Valdez Street, ahead of number 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafficker was travelling in a white pick-up truck in which he was carrying a black bag in the luggage carrier of the vehicle and in the co-pilot's place a small backpack where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the confiscated material has been made available to the Second District Judge and the convicted person is still in the Enforcement Centre for the Legal Consequences of Offences.
Debts to contributions to works
Works of a social nature contemplated in programmes such as Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 para migrantes may not be finished or record serious delays due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The Director of Municipal Social Development indicated that, although so far construction programmes have progressed, they are at risk, as the Government of the State has not fulfilled its obligations to offer contributions in excess of 11 million pesos in all three programmes.
He pointed out that the total investment of these three programs is approximately 50 million pesos, of which the state must provide 25 percent and so far only the Federation and the Municipal have provided resources for the works, therefore there is the possibility of a delay in their finalization.
"They have to make a contribution of 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end they have given us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a part," he says, "and we, in order not to record delays, have started the works and we have made much progress, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, therefore at the beginning of the administration the Municipal had to apply for a credit to cover the 7 million that the State administration had not provided at that time.
"We had experienced this in the previous six-year period because the state had not had the economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to work, and this year, in order to have access to these programs, we had to get the resources to cover what the state had not paid," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a commitment on the part of the State authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had made a request to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to activate the management so that the corresponding percentages would arrive as soon as possible.
"They have to supply almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year will soon end, they have not given us anything."
The Court validates "the analog cut" in Mexico in 2015
The substitution of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) rejected the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have formulated against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analog cut" from 2021 to 2015, because the eight votes necessary to invalidate it have not been combined.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers when he issued the decree detailing the actions to be taken to make the transition to digital terrestrial television a reality.
With this result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was rejected for failing to reach a qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to rule on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality of the decree, and this continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the decree as non-constitutional, because radio and television regulation is an assignment reserved by law to the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
In favour of the project only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero even voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree and admit the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions planned by it for the digital transition.
The plenary session of the Ministers also resolved to reject the complaint made by the Chamber of Deputies, without discussing the project for which Minister Sánchez Cordero is also responsible.
In his speech, the minister president said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executive cannot structure through general standards the measures for the public administration to prepare for it.
"I also consider that if it were to do so, the autonomy of the regulatory body would be affected," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executive, which has the constitutional mandate of State leadership.
The substitution of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years and is reflected in better exploitation of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Adjournment of the change, he argued, would postpone the benefits of digitalisation, which involves a decision in the public interest that has not only a technical dimension, "because it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, he stressed, "require the operation of an entire system established, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the State, includes a group of powers that the Constitution grants to the faculty of the Executive of the State."
He recalled that a large number of countries all over the world have already completed the digital transition and they have done so through the Executive, despite the fact that they have very specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, in issuing the contested decree, has somehow invaded the sphere of competence of Congress, as it ensures in the administrative sphere compliance with the laws issued by the Legislature, he assured.
The possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán is analysed.
According to the data provided by PREP, the difference between the first and second places in the Governor's election is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,774 total minutes.
The possibility of the "vote by vote" count is a reality with regard to the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data highlighted by the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PREP) the difference between the first and second places of the governor's election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to the 879 of the 6,774 total minutes.
In this connection, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, in the past 9 November, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards with federal electoral reform.
It will be recalled that Michoacán did not certify either his Political Constitution or his State Electoral Code or his Electoral Justice Act, at the same time as the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the end of the legal deadline for this electoral trial to enter into force, and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted his publication within the time limits prescribed by the Law of the State Official Gazette, with the argument that he had some objections.
On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local legislature and described as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State agent for constitutional reforms, as it has no right to "sanction or challenge them."
Interviewed on the possibility of "voting by vote," María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of IEM it will be possible to carry out partial and total counts of votes by the local electoral body.
Thus, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, it may be that: the results of the minutes coincide; there are no minutes of voting and there are no counts in the ballot box record at the President's office; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the minutes.
In addition, the total count of the votes received in all ballot boxes in the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the candidate who is supposed to win the respective election and the candidate who obtained the second place in the election is equal to or below one percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express petition from the party representative and / or coalition that presented the second of the candidates reported.
The total count may also be carried out if, at the end of the common count, the difference between the alleged winner and the second-place candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express petition from the representative of the political party from which the candidate has been placed second, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of the partial count will be excluded.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the Morelia election, where according to the PREP, the difference between first and second place is only 0.16 percent, even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes.
His last will
His ashes will be spread in the Sierra of Zapaliname, confirms the family.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés will arrive in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday towards the night, and on Monday people will present their tributes and there will be a misse of requiem.
According to his family, the lieutenant-colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be spread in the Sierra of Zapaliname.
After receiving the tributes next to the other people who died in the accident, the family of Bacio Cortés returned to the capital of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest ones attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant-colonel arrived at the wake chapel of Nazario Ortiz Garza Boulevard, where the family and friends went.
At 5: 30 p.m., he was honoured at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former Baccalaureate of Technology colleagues and the American football team of which Felipe Bacio was a member when he was preparing for the Baccalaureate.
"He wanted to go back to Saltillo and that his ashes were spread in the Sierra of Zapaliname, he always said this" to his family and friends, "said Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot.
For her, the lieutenant-colonel had realized all his dreams, she considered that he was at the fullness of his life, "he was successful, he was a father and son, extraordinary, an affectionate brother and cared for his family a lot."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to register at the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some could not believe it, for they said that he even had a truck problem; but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers that he was a very good person, "when he was in Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him, as was the occasion in which he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man even remembers the fact that when he was 7 years old he travelled to Zapopán for the graduation of his parent, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying an aircraft.
His last farewell
With honors it was said goodbye to Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, who had at the head Governor Jorge Torres López, presented by the people and the Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force, directors and students of the Technological Institute of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and distinguished himself both in studies and in sport.
Bacio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was flying crashed, next to the Secretary of Government, José Francisco Blake Mora and other six people, all officials of this service.
The remains of pilot Bacio Cortés, born in Saltillo, arrived (incinerated) at 18: 05 hours to be handed over by the funeral to the members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the esplanade of the group, where he was expected by his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, brothers and other parents, students and masters.
Three abandoned corpses, located in the property of Cadereyta NL
A few hours before being found, the military authority had presented to the media eleven persons who had been arrested in the same municipality for offences relating to organized crimes.
Three men were found shot and killed in various parts of the body and with the coup de grâce, in an abandoned property of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The discovery took place at mile 1.5 of road from Cadereyta to Santiago, in the community known as El Castillo.
Some people who went through this place observed that in the property, whose fence has beige color and coffee the portal was widely open.
Looking inside, about three metres away, they located the corpses of three people, which is why they immediately informed the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals wore a yellow T-shirt with dark jeans, without shoes; on his side there was another with a white T-shirt, with straps.
One meter away there was another individual's body with a red T-shirt and blue jeans.
All three were lying on the belly.
According to in situ data, the three people had been murdered in another location, as casings were not found in situ.
In the fence of the property there were legends addressed by a group of organized delinquency towards the other, apart from some bullet holes in it and in the portal.
11 captured in Cadereyta
The Secretary of National Defence presented 11 persons, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in Cadereyta municipality and are considered to be related to sequestrations, homicides, "halconeo" (surveillance) and clandestine burial.
According to the information published, in a first fact on 11 November in the settlement of Los Alveros eight people were arrested and one who had been deprived of liberty was saved.
They were confiscated from three buildings and one cell phone; they claimed that they were part of the criminal group called "Los Zetas."
In another fact that took place on November 12 at 06: 00 hours, military personnel made a surveillance journey to Rancho Viejo, Cadereyta, by detecting a car without a license plate with two subjects on board.
By arresting them and carrying out an inspection, the military found a long weapon, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on 13 November at 2: 00 p.m. one of his accomplices was arrested in La Frauda, when he tried to escape when he saw the military.
They are attributed clandestine burial in the munitions of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the verge of economic disaster
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the verge of economic disaster and put the whole Eurozone in jeopardy.
A communiqué from the presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would meet Wednesday with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that he can form the Government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed of technocrats in his majorities, although it is not clear when the new executive takes up his post.
Monti said he was going to present to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner for Journalists.
Monti did not explicitly say that he could form a government, but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles had been overcome.
The "framework is now well-framed," he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, in a shorter time than usual, while Italy is fighting a political and financial crisis that has pushed the costs of its debt to levels that are impossible to sustain.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the confidence in Italy that had been affected.
Highlighting the pressure on Monti to hurry, the instability of the markets placed the yield of the Italian BTP bonds at 10 years above 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian employers Confindustria, told the media after her meeting with Monti: "We said we would very much support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy to emerge from this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were greatly stimulated by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, to which the crisis forced him to resign on last Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, to the press.
The support of PDL, the largest Italian party, is significant because so far many of its members have opposed Monti's technocratic majority government.
Parliamentary support
Monti's new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what is likely to be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any deadlock or delay in its efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign benches added to the pressure by observing that a bankruptcy of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began consultations on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers & apos; groups and youth and women & apos; s organizations.
He'll finish his meeting tour Tuesday at night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who allowed an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the costs of Italian debt have now returned to critical levels between uncertainty about the success of the new Prime Minister.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of €1.9 trillion, would be too much for Eurozone's current financial defences.
Monti said that his Government should persist until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to implement the reforms before moving the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be formed only by specialists, an indication of their objections to a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have reported that mutual distrust and disagreements between parties complicate the attempt to include political figures.
The experience of Spaniards is superior to that of Costaricians
Of the 22 football players called from Spain, ten have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited participated in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to that of Costa Rica, when we compare the 22 convoked by the two countries for today's friendly, at 3: 05 p.m., at the National Stadium of San José.
While the national and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly standings, count an extensive register of inter-selected Class A games, the Habs only have defenseman Michael Umana as the only one to have the 50 international games.
This figure was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintain an intense year-round activity in national league and cup championships and disputes in European cup like the Champions League.
To all this we must add the experience with Furia Espanola during the complicated playoffs of the European Cup and the World Football Championship.
Costa Rican footballers, on the contrary, have international experience limited to an area, such as the Concacaf, which is considered to be a lower level in FIFA.
We see that the biggest record of the Spanish Selection is that of goaltender Íker Casillas, who on the previous Saturday against England (defence 0-1 in London) matched the record of former goaltender Andoni Zuardireta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the Habs today and they will impose a new record for Spain, of 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, a cerebral flywheel from Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zuzarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front-centre of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Loan of the centenary number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
It is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
From Costa Rican, and near Michael Umana are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and the scorer Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After this, only five have surpassed the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, there are Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
On the national side, with less than 30 presences, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest doesn't even get to 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson do not yet start.
The historic scorer of Spain is David Villa, with 50 flies, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with the most, with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto has included the country in its turn to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become reality"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bass player Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of its best concerts on the National Stadium on Sunday.
They have waited more than 20 years, but the group assures that for them it will also be a dream become reality to happen in this country.
It is that bass player and founding member Jeff Ament assured, speaking exclusively with Viva of Brazil, last week.
The group is in the South American wing of its tour celebrating two decades of work and Sunday 20 will make its only stop in Central America.
That day will be on the National Stadium, starting at 7: 30 p.m., next to the Los Angeles Group The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which can be found in La Nación on the Internet.
For his Costa Rican followers, the fact that Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream that has come true. Are you aware of what your fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream that has become a reality for us too.
This is our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been grandiose.
I spent in Costa Rica only once the holidays; it is such a beautiful country and I think we can spend a few days there.
So it makes us very emotional to wear our music there.
I ask you, because there is some kind of devotion to the band, fans live intensely on previous days.
What is your message to your fervent followers?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
It took 21 years for us to arrive in Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that so much time had to pass to this concert.
A few people already say that his concert is the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the larger shows we have offered over the past 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We have offered a two gigantic shows in Sao Paolo and we hope it has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to it.
We love this country, we love surfing and jungle; for both things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you discover Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
We have a lot of friends surfing and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves are incredible there.
My friends were always surfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, next to Mexico, are great places to surf; that's how we learned, through the surfists who love surfing.
Seeing the tour, you offered huge shows, with lots of songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we have never been there, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to do the best possible show, with a wide variety of songs; we will try to interpret two songs from each album and offer our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the directory.
What's this all about?
I think it's partly because we have nine records and we can perform more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, which is why it's very difficult to choose which songs to perform each evening.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven't played for a very long time, it helps us stay focused and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it also becomes more interesting for people.
With this tour, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I don't think any of us had imagined that we were going to form a big rock band, and the fact that we did it for more than 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the fact that we can continue to make music together makes us very emotional.
We love each other and love to create music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world that we have always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What does it mean for you to have been a fundamental element in the creation of the grunge?
It has always been an honour for us to be part of this group of major groups.
We're very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
This is surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends and is unusual.
From time to time, a group emerges from a city, but it is much more strange when five or ten groups come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and it is an honour for us to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we went to Canada with Mudhoney, we saw in Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be friends again with all of them and it's an honor for us to form part of this Seattle sound that came up.
It's also very strange that a group like yours is holding together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much longer than many groups normally last.
First, I believe that we are all lucky to be still alive, and second, we are all concerned about others.
We are all close friends and thanks to this there are musical boulevards that give everyone freedom to experiment.
We have confidence in each other with each other's music and that could not be better.
Your relationship with the word celebrity has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grew up, it was easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure that we don't spend too much time on tour because it's easy to fall into this game of great multitudes and people who love your music.
If we do not forget that people are there for music, it helps us not to forget that we must respect the music and what brought it, without putting in mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which is not really interested in any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some good songs and at first it was great.
We were a band for almost three years and did not publish a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
There were many frustrations for the fact that it lasted so little and the most important is the fact that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the band with us and when I listen to a song or I see a photo I think of the amazing person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to work, laugh, talk about music, football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and we miss him.
The national group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and for that you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with different proposals and this one was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and that must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's lyrics live?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first words he imagines.
As a bass player, what are his influences?
There are so many...
Among the first ones I remember were Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences, I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam maintain the grunge despite the fact that it is no longer fashionable?
I think we all feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands I have just mentioned, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that have emerged at the same time and, if that's relevant now, I think it's wonderful, because it's a music that's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now doing the best music ever.
At first, his music had more obscure content and now it has become more positive.
What is the reason for this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very obscure songs, even though they may sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I listened to them and these are deeply obscure songs.
I think if you grow up and there's a trauma in your life and you lose to a relative or friend, these things start to influence your art and your music and these songs, no doubt, represent that to me.
I also think we can be happy too, and even so we can make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori rehospitalized for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength that he presents in the pies, informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his government (1990-2000), suffers from a variety of conditions, including a language cancer for which he was operated four times and which is under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said for Canal N TV that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength in its lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate for the benefit of the remission of the sentence for humanitarian reasons, no doubt, he said that he does not want it because he feels innocent.
He has been operated four times with tongue cancer, he has a weight loss of 18 kilos, and other pathologies, such as severe erotic gastritis, a pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the feet, listed the doctor.
Fujimori has been serving imprisonment since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the death of 25 people because of an army annihilation squadron that operated underground during the first years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official procession, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of various ministers and bosses, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with its Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political and trade authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayan residents in Mexico, according to the agenda circulated by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two Presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "conducive to the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations," according to the information published by the South American Presidency on its web page.
According to local media, Mujica is trying to convince Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that took place when the French agent, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of tax havens, in the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that led to the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultations by its ambassador from this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the world's strongest emerging and developed countries, and has been in force with the South American country since January this year, a convention to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has tried in recent years to speed up the implementation of the tax exchange agreements to get out of the "gri list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), integrated by countries that do not implement all the international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
On the trade front, Mexico and Uruguay have in force since 2004 a Free Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustache plumber moves to three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario fought relentlessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the claws of bad Bowser, but he had never done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young woman in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month at shops all over the world, was designed from the start to make good use of the features of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without using glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how to work stereoscopy without glasses," said Nintendo's Spanish press officer Omar Álvarez, during the video game presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for this medium," because so far successes such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesperson argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows a fast and fluid game.
Álvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hang less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experts will be able to make a "second round" at the game levels, which this time are more difficult.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to be able to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions."
This incursion of Super Mario in all three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a mobile console, a fact that has not been happening since 2005.
In these video games Nintendo winks at the followers of the saga and repeats the formula of success of the previous games, which consists in the fact that the mustachu plumber must travel platforms mined by perils to free Princess Peach.
Even if I find new things in movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also in the cases of Luigi "playable."
Colom supports Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced last Tuesday that he had issued an order for the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiracy for the laundering of 70 million US dollars.
This concludes the trial in order for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that asked Portillo to try him there.
In a press conference, Colom stated that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered his extradition.
He stated that during his term of office he "did not help" in any judicial resolution, and he gave way to all the extradition he had experienced.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will also be extradited for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extradited for drug trafficking.
What Colom has done presupposes an executive approach after having exhausted all the judicial and constitutional bodies to try the former representative of the period 2004-2004.
According to the resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited after having resolved his legal situation in Guatemala and after having guaranteed his human rights.
Portillo was absolute for embezzlement of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was president, which was the pre-extradition trial, but the Public Prosecutor's Office appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the marginalization of young people without training
The record of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have been helped to overcome a difficult situation during this quarter century.
To this is added the long hundredth of the jobs currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary was used yesterday to take stock in an act celebrated in a former Fabra i Coats industrial complex attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping people who are poorly trained, without work, with substance abuse problems or marginalized.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of heads of entities and institutions who in these 25 years collaborated with the association.
The varied political representation during the election season showed the unitary nature of Trinijove's work.
Alongside the President of the Catalan Regional Government (Generalitat), Artur Mas and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the former Socialist Education Minister, Ernest Maragall and the former Deputy Mayor to the Mayor and current Eco-Socialist municipal councillor Ricard Goma.
The present Minister of Social Welfare and Family Josep Lluís Cleries and La Caixa's general manager of charity, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Grand Hall of Fabra i Coats.
Mas claimed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and the current one is, too, but he added that the work done so far "is a good basis."
The president gave Trinidad as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new to the entity and the work it does," he said.
Property invaded by squatters for micro-parties, evacuated
The invaders had appropriated 11 of the building's 13 apartments, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants abandoned the property at noon yesterday without any resistance
There is every indication that the nightmare that residents of the number 51 Balmes Street lived has ended.
At noon yesterday, 12 people voluntarily abandoned the building they were illegally occupying and where they were organizing micro-festivals that despised neighbours, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
At the end of the operation, the door lock was changed to prevent a recurrence of the situation.
"From today there will be access control," said the administrator.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took away the electrical installation and part of the water, apart from painting the walls and leaving residues of all kinds, especially boxes of alcoholic beverages.
The first three apartments were the scene of mass feasts, which lasted for up to two days and despaired the tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which has also been affected.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the occupation of the building his business dropped an 80%.
The owner of the discotheque mentioned that the invaders of the property gave him unfair jurisdiction, because they sold the glasses for three euros, while in the discotheque they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure facility had had to respond to the neighbours' complaints about noise, while according to the latter, the trouble was not caused by the customers of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and especially the participants in the parties organized there, which were more frequent and intense in recent weeks, according to the irritated neighbours of the area.
The head of the discotheque explained that the trouble was so great that it even led to an agreement with the owner of the building and he has "forgiven" the rent for nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that in recent weeks they had received more complaints from neighbours about this situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP of the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had called last week "for the immediate evacuation of the building to end with the problems of common and civic life that it caused to the residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the summer only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last months squatters had occupied all the floors of the building and almost all the apartments and that in some apartments there were flights too.
It was in this sense that he added that "we must end with impunity and be relentless against the antisocial behaviour generated in the property."
Also yesterday, the Mossos (the local Catalan police) evacuated a building to Nou Barris.
At 15.30 hours the police moved to the number 35 of Rue Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbour who had observed that four people were entering the building.
All four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
The architects coincide on the advisability of the convocation beyond the controversy on the honoraria
The municipal competition on the 16 doors opens again the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the already-extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), the Authority printed promotional posters for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In addition, it also contained a comparison, in figures, with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the CMB in 1987, the park again became, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the only Catalan capital not oriented on the north-south axis, if not high (mountain) - low (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park is to the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park except Yellowstone, with wild boars in the role of the Yogi bear.
This was the situation until, in September, the town hall convened a mega-competition composed of 16 contests for all the access doors in Collserola.
There's a door back to the idea of a park, no doubt.
That's it, or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question appears on its own: Colserola: park or mountain?
The contest, both as regards its organization and as regards the reflection on the city is a conversation theme of all the architects of Barcelona.
It's almost a recurring theme that two members of this former caste of elected officials talk about when they recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this is just one of the few opinions on which three architects from Barcelona, university professors, who presented themselves, coincide.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after approaching the coastal front "it is necessary to" debate on "the mountain front" because the speech of Ildefons Cerda, that of green blocks has not been completed.
"You have to start from the base that Barcelona's larger park is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more complex, "the architect gave the verdict for which the title of" doors of Collserola "contains a" lexical trap ": one should not think of these" as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which action is required. "
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, describes the proposal as "intellectual challenge" with "a few perils."
Perils which derive from the "uncertainty of the projection of public space" after the experience experienced in the 1980s and which had in the Forum area "its swan song."
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which one can build.
"Limiting something means already establishing the next step," that is, its overtaking.
"We have to think about new urban planning instruments, because current ones [with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)] can cause genuine disasters."
By keeping more to the question, Modol opines that, by simplifying, the slope of the El Valles de Collserola region "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, no."
Modol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat de Collserola which "must not be lost," thanking for the opportunity that the town hall offers its corporation to intervene in this project "from the first moment."
Moreover, he understood that the proximity of the mountain to the city was the safe way for architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("quite a success," he said) that had to be created: "We architects should be only an instrument."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title of this play is complex, because from the bases of the contest it lacks a global vision of Colserola: "We have convened 16 transversal contests - he says - in the mountain-sea direction, but there is not a longitudinal reading that sees and understands the area as a whole."
This means, at least in this case, that he chose to take part in the 16 competitions.
In another way, a project so that one of the doors could shock in the program and define with that of the architect of the nearby door.
In its opinion, yes, the town hall should ensure that the band immediately superior to Ronda de Dalt should provide, in all its extension, an area of equipment that makes a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this one will be released
After 72 days of provisional arrest, Casino Red's legal power-holder granted forgiveness to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for the trial initiated against him for alleged blackmail
After spending 72 years arrested, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the founder of Casino Red's legal power grants him forgiveness before the Second Criminal Court of the District, which follows a blackmail trial against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack at the Casino Royale, Casino Red owner Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly required him to pay an economic quote for the mayor of Monterrey to allow the clandestine operation of the gambling house.
Following the public denunciation, the Public Prosecutor's Office opened a criminal trial against the brother of the mayor of PANISTA and on 2 September he was arrested and kept under provisional arrest for 30 days.
After four hours in front of the Public Prosecutor's Office 3 of Penal Offences, he was transferred to Detention Centre 1, located in the Old District of the State Capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when he was given a second detention order after the officer of the Public Prosecutor's Office rejected the offences of corruption and organized crime.
On October 19 he was transferred to the Cadereyta penal centre allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with a million and a half pesos; but he spent only a few hours in the medium security detention centre because there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the closed trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October an order of capture was issued by the registrar of the Second Criminal Court of the District, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigation there was sufficient confirmed evidence to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as that relating to the receipt of 1.5 million pesos of representatives of the gambling house in exchange for allowing its operation.
This Monday, the founder of the legal power of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pecina to seek forgiveness for the brother of the mayor of the region; therefore he could recover his freedom in the following hours.
During the legal formalities, the Public Prosecutor attached to the Tribunal, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who the partners of the gambling house had been the one who had granted the pardon, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
According to file 197 / 2011, Jonás Larrazábal is granted legal forgiveness and subsequently no claim can be made in connection with the trial against him; he will not be asked for any compensation for the damage and no punishment.
After the hearing of the founder of the legal power of the gambling house, at 15: 50 hours the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Registrar of the Tribunal, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also communicate to him the immediate order of liberty issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the air accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake and other seven people lost their lives
The Communications and Transportation Secretariat (TBS) has informed that the results of the accident in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora and other seven people lost their lives indicate that the helicopter shocked directly against the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to try a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transportation, reported that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found that the weather conditions were adequate for flight.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had various contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, so the unit met the requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that investigations in the impacting area did not report the appearance of ground parts.
"In one research it was reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another location, the impact was structurally present.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and met the requirements to transport them.
The soil had a pant of seven to 30 degrees inclination.
For the time being, the secretary has assured that a priority is to have the results as quickly as possible; but the investigation can last a few months, it can even last a year.
In turn, Gilberto López Meyer, General Manager of Airports and Auxiliary Services, assured that the moment of impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Major State was operating at cruising speed and this took place on a soft, ascending ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of normal cruising at the time of impact," he says.
During the press conference, the SCT holder, Pérez Jácome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the Aeronautical Standards, the flight was conducted according to visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicated adequate take-off conditions, and as the aircraft advanced to the boundary area between DF and the State of Mexico there were low cloud layers.
Selected roads:
It is likely that due to the cloud conditions, the crew sought an area of lower height and more visibility towards the Cuernavaca valley.
Location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last recording of the aircraft on the radar coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration of the flight path.
Dispersion of aircraft remains in a reduced area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact has taken place on a straight and lateral path.
The aircraft remains dispersal model suggests that the helicopter struck the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
Traces of fire or explosion were not detected:
In the location of the disaster there is still no trace in the remains of the aircraft of a type of explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that the aircraft had had multiple contacts with the ground.
During the field work, parts of the aircraft were found at a height of 9,2200 feet above the middle sea level, and the ground had a slope that had since seven drifts to 30 degrees inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which he may have disarticulated along his journey.
The information provides evidence that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts with the ground.
After a thorough search in an area larger than the surrounding area around the accident, dispersive parts of the aircraft were not found, which supports the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find the obesity gene
Social Insurance leads an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Social Insurance Institute (IMSS) has announced that it is leading an investigation to discover the obesity gene for children and young people, known as the 'Genetics of Obesity in Children and Adolescents' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the 20th Century National Medical Centre, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been formed.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Centre for Advanced Investigation and Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The investigation involves the participation of the population entitled or not, and the participation of the IMSS sports units in Valle de México, where evidence is provided to minors every Saturday from 8: 00 am.
He pointed out that the protocol began in the Cuauhtemoc Sports Unit (Estado de México Poniente) and that from 8 October, the activity takes place in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Estado de México Oriente).
After reaching the goal of bringing together 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sportive Independencia Unit (south of Distrito Federal) and finally in the Sportive Morelos Unit (north of Distrito Federal).
He explained that the objective of this investigation and that of knowing the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and identifying risk factors in Mexican children and young people to prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
As the World Diabetes Day will be celebrated on 14 November, he mentioned that the aim is to bring together three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the implementation of the specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and history of family heredity of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that trigger conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin, and genetic (looking to identify people associated with childhood obesity) will be applied to all participants.
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the result of the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in the case of minors.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys reported that in only six years there was an increase of 77 per cent in obesity for boys and 47 per cent for girls; overweight was also seen a dramatic increase," said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the rationale for finding markers is based on the fact that the country's population is different from others in its genetic history.
He informed that on average, Mexicans have a 65 per cent Indo-American inheritance, a 30 per cent European and a five per cent African, and this condition is reflected in people associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity results in the inability to burn the excess energy that is consumed (calories), which is deposited in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the full assessment of children, which allows for the detection of overweight or obesity.
It also says that the presence of dark-coloured folds (acanthosis) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of suffering metabolic and even pre-diabetic alterations.
The information is managed in a confidential manner, with physicians giving it to parents in writing, explaining each of the measures and lifestyle changes that they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of TV and using means of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another cause is the high calorie intake, that is, the greater consumption of sweet drinks, carbohydrates (tamales - meat pâté with corn flour wrapped in corn leaves - bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM asphalt would avoid blackcurrant
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs that the pavement were resolved, it would no longer be necessary to repair about 200 thousand currants each rainy season in the Metropolitan Zone of Valle de México, warns Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of the asphalt pavement is adequate, the currants could be reduced or even eliminated completely.
During his conference Une opinion technologique sur les cassis, organized as part of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical strength, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera considered that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve yield, and therefore the formation of blackcurrant.
He explained that asphalt, the heavier part of the oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a heavier molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and molecules with a low molecular weight, called malagasy, which together give the pavement its viscoelastic behaviour characteristic.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists in the fact that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, behave like a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it has an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes breaking, he added.
This means that in the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform and changes during the day depending on environmental conditions and temperature, warns the chemical engineering specialist.
The FQ researcher observed that the majority of the streets of Ciudad de México were covered by a flexible pavement, composed of six layers of materials, the last three of which involved asphalt.
Between the more superficial layers is the asphalt layer, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and compacted later.
Each of the small stones forming the layer, he pointed out, is bathed in asphalt.
When vehicles pass through it by generating effort, this allows the forces to spread very well in the pavement.
If we had modified asphalt, it would spread better, but it was thought to be a chemical engineer.
On the asphalt layer, he said, one puts a final layer called a bearing layer, made of fine stone, that is, sand which is also bathed in asphalt.
As this is the layer in contact with the wheels of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt layer and provide grip in the street.
As the part of the pavement that receives and distributes the forces, the bearing layer also requires that it be of adequate thickness and that the material it is made of be treated.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he says, because these affect considerably the yield of the asphalt layer.
When the soil gets wet, the water spreads inside the layer is difficult for it to come out, which softens all layers of the pavement and therefore causes currants.
In the process of forming a blackcurrant, he says, the first one that is ruined is the rolling film and only later is affected the asphalt layer, but the damage does not happen immediately, but it is a process that must be cured at the first signals with adequate maintenance programs.
The member of the National System of Researchers explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the formation of blackcurrant and therefore the thickness of each layer of the pavement must always be related to the load of vehicles and guarantee its satisfaction, in order to avoid the frequent formation of blackcurrant.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still a lot to investigate and work on asphalt, for example, bituminous emulsions, which in other countries already exist on the market and allow to repair blackcurrant easily and without having to use high temperatures.
What did Valle's candidate miss to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that made Melina Ramírez Serna not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
Valle received her number 14 Princess title.
Once again Valle del Cauca remained with the desire to win the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained yesterday evening in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico was raised with the crown and the scepter, the department already consists of 14 titles of Princess and Melina one at a legion of women of Valle del Cauca who found themselves near the crown but were proclaimed princesses, among which Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Gardants Aljure (2008).
Today the great question that many people are asking is:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite that in each presentation demonstrated that she had it all to be the new Miss Colombia, because she had not been elected in vain Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles obtained by the queens Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who won the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered key in the jury's decision to appoint her as First Princess is the fact that she did not convince with her answer to the question "? What was the book that marked you and why? was asked by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
Here is Valle's candidate's answer to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in literature, I think it's a form of culture, definitely I think the book that marked my childhood is" The Little Prince, "it's a pretty deep book.
Now I read "Crime and Punishment," it is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The ardour of blood." "
This response was not pleasing first because of the term "culturalize" and second because it did not explain in concrete terms how each book cited had marked it.
But at the end of the Melina ceremony said that she felt calm and happy with the result "the universe and wise, what has to happen is happening.
And for everyone, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book. "
Between the hypotheses is that Valle was destroyed by favouritism.
A Bogota journalist suggested that being the favorite, the ovationist and the candidate who received all the preliminary prizes (Oster gastronomy challenge, the public vote for the best craft costume, and Queen Mother), "it awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she didn't shine on the stage."
And this was noted in his first swimsuit presentation at Hilton Beach and his two parades on the eve of the coronation.
Even though at the two parades she seemed sure of herself, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the "Como en casa" (Like at home) program, of the Canal RCN stated that the fact that Melina was appointed princess "confirms the fact that the candidate who gets most of the prizes during the contest does not receive the crown of queen."
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end, and that was a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social initiatives, which is in fact the essence of the National Beauty Competition.
That's why two days before the election international jury Lucy Doughty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond physics and focus on its social sensitivity, that before you start the Competition are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned by his flaws from behind and the fibrosis that was observed in his abdomen, but this is contradictory, because precisely the jury elected him as candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
Queens preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco acknowledges that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better ones, "but his problem of fibrosis on the abdomen, which in reality for me had not been too notorious, left him points on the last day."
Meanwhile journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine considers that Valle's candidate's mistake was the surgical procedures she had undergone.
"The surgeries are good, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her asset and she lost because of this aspect. "
For this award, which the National Beauty Contest presents for the first time, after the swimsuit parade, a cruel prediction arose that happened last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo gave Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of reign, not as a sovereign, if not a princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by appointing the National Competition.
However, she will pass in history as one of the queens who despite her dazzling passage through Cartagena, did not get the crown.
So was the work of the person of Cali who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cano
A typist from Cali has gone to history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials is crucial.
The past 4 November a typist of the CTI of Cali passed to history as the person who confirmed the identity of the supreme leader of the Farc: "Alfonso Cano," comparing his fingerprints.
Of the seven typists who work in the local offices of the CTI, this week it was Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the field of judicial investigation for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó, where many times he had to spend more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the dead bodies were to be identified.
In the year 2000 he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after having completed appropriate courses, he specialized in typing, which is the study of friction skin, that is, palms and feet.
During the week of the operation against alias Alfonso Cano Eliazar was warned to take with him clothes for at least three days.
Something very big was waiting for him.
Friday night he left for Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that it was suspected that one of them was the man who ruled the oldest guerrilla in the world, so he was asked to carry the card with the ten fingerprints of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
But when he arrived with the investigation team at the location of the corpse, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from the one he had seen in the media.
He had no beard, he was dressed like a peasant in the area, without glasses and much more lean.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a collector and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the map.
His eye did not deceive him: it was "Alfonso Cano."
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was the official who confirmed to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the supreme leader of the Farc.
Searching for the print
For a typist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in a press conference for the operation against "Cano," is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our job.
Typing is an exact science, with no margin of error, which can be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying corpses, typists support investigations for crimes such as theft and homicide and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When captured, many offenders present false identity cards or do not have documents.
We take their fingerprints and search the database for them.
The researcher told that in a case of theft he had to remove part of a wall from a house, because in that place the thief had pressed his hand to bring out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate areas to draw a fingerprint, but in this case we were able to get the fingerprint from all hands and identify the offender who had participated in various robberies," he recalls.
Fingerprints can also rule out or confirm suspects in homicide cases.
Recently we found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
Interference from the investigation it was determined that a parent could be suspected of the crime and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle coincided.
Even if it doesn't guarantee that he's the killer, it puts him at the scene of the crime.
An ITC typist explained that "fingerprints of objects with chemical or physical reagents are extracted."
When they appear, a sampler or tape is used to collect them.
Later, the prints are sent to Asif, the database of the decliners, or to the National Civil Registry.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of undocumented Colombians," said the ITC expert.
He explained that not everything is shown in the CSI television program.
Like everything that shines is not gold, everything you touch doesn't necessarily become a fingerprint.
It can, however, be used if the necessary confrontation is achieved.
The "indignant" defy authorities in New York City
Hundreds of protesters rushed in front of Zuccotti Square to camp there.
A large proportion of the people reached the evacuation order and moved to a nearby park.
The integrants of the Occupupe Wall Street movement challenged the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, through a judicial order, Manhattan instead, from where they were evacuated at dawn and when they tried to occupy another Great Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters were rushing in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted access through a judicial order that allowed the 'indignants' to camp again in that place, while the other side of the movement responded to the evacuation by occupying a park further north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again in the square, we will settle in another place and we will continue the legal struggle to return to Zuccotti, and through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," says one of the spokesmen of the "Occupy Wall Street" movement, Mark Bray.
Bray detailed that the response of the 'indignants' to the evacuation of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the area and allowing the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the 'indignants' occupied a new park at the confluence of Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to Holland Tunnel, which unites New York and New Jersey, owned by Trinity Church Parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but after the police moved there and arrested some demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the concrete figure, assuring Efe that he saw some journalists who had also been handcuffed.
The organization assures that there are centenarians of people who had settled in this place, where a delegation of religious leaders moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to intervene on their behalf in front of the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square - which is a private building - remains closed pending the celebration of a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday, during which the legality of this morning's evacuation must be analysed.
Some protesters previously displaced were carrying and distributing copies of this court order at that time and they were even handing it over to the agents who were watching the square, which caused 'some small clashes', said Bray, who denounced the fact that some officials hit the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibits the authorities from evacuating members of Occupupe Wall Street or applying 'laws published after the beginning of the occupation or prohibiting demonstrators from re-entering the park with tents or other properties they previously used'.
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, because of this judicial order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and demonstrators, but warned them that local laws did not allow them to settle with tents and sleeping bags.
The municipal councilman personally defended the evacuation at dawn in Zuccotti Square, an operation during which 200 people were arrested and decided because the demonstrators were 'breaking the law'.
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it became "a place where people did not come to protest, but to violate the laws and in some cases to hurt others," because "some shops had received threats" and residents were afraid "for their quality of life."
"This morning's evacuation at dawn was repugnant and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in defending the financial interests than those of American workers," added the spokesman for the movement, who accused the mayor of "not respecting freedom of expression."
The officials of "Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they do not think they will organize "big actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson to be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas television program
Next to Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will be released in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," a relief worker in "Baywatch," a rabbit in "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a special Christmas program on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, next to the "crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will release in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1 interpreting a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today distributed images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the extensive broadcast on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husband of that time, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee, appears dressed as the Virgin Mary by supporting in a crib a doll that represents to Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian actor of Indian origin who recently introduced a part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears come Joseph.
Along with Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special program also features Canadian singer Bublé, who at the end of March married the Argentinean model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is not far from controversy.
Recently, Bublé called "whore" the American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan Reborn After Earthquake
GDP rises 1.5% due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral of early March
Since March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, convalescent even after the devastating earthquake that has become a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster in Japan since the Second World War.
The initial estimates of the Tokyo Government had calculated property losses at $300,000 million, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seemed to have diminished.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, data from the Gross Domestic Product between July and September were used to turn the page permanently: GDP rose by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% in annualised rates.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also assumes the highest rate of increase since January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly due to the resumption of the acquisition of equipment to restore the areas devastated by the earthquake and the post-tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decrease in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
However, the real stimulus of the Japanese economy is not based exclusively on the Keynesian impulse that invites to take advantage of the crisis to consolidate - or rebuild - infrastructure, to use deficiencies to grow from zero.
Japan has woken up mainly as a result of changes in domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and entertainment.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo returned to the internal market when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "safe havens" elected by investors fleeing the debt crisis in the Eurozone and the trouble forecast of the United States, a privilege that weighs like a slab in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of major technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, had the yen's contribution responsible for their poor performance between July and September.
While markets continue to hold their seats in the peripheral EU countries, the Government of Yoshihiko Noda does not lower the guard.
"We need to monitor the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said the Secretary of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not at all encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) mentioned that the majority of member countries presented clearer signals of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that anticipates the inflection points of the world economy has highlighted that the main powers are being curtailed.
For it dropped four decimal places to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
Eurozone was even below the average, which is in level 100, n lowering eight decimal places to 99.13 points.
Athens fuels doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but the Conservatives will not sign any written commitments
With the peripheral risk premiums triggered and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to meddle in the labyrinth that leads to the exit of the major European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Greek Transitional Government is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by a real conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, announced yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period set in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the Conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support the new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit," Papadimos said yesterday when he opened a parliamentary debate that will end tomorrow with a vote of confidence for the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, the reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras no's message casts doubt on his position: "We have committed ourselves to helping the Transitional Government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything more."
The conservative leader has gone a step further in his pulse than EU and IMF, the bodies that need to release the 8,000 million that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not approve any letter of commitment to make the adjustments.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not release the aid if the new Government and the leaders of the main Greek parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity as soon as possible."
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors would return "very quickly" to Athens to discuss with the new Government "the elements necessary to pay the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no definitive date either.
The Greeks still have a lot to do.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresses Spain's "predominant" position with regard to this type of finance
Spain "has reached a world-leading location in the role of Micro-finance."
Queen Sofía recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in this instrument of cooperation whose "essence" lies in the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being."
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the 5th World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid with the certainty that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "absolutely indispensable" for achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals for 2015, and, "especially, for the purpose of reducing to half the volume of people living with incomes below one dollar a day, to which the" poverty line "is set."
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "in all corners of the world, and is taking on this task with" responsibility, "said Queen Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originating during the Summit, which will last until Thursday," guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans.
We have "achieved many goals" and "face many challenges."
The Microcredit Summit is seen not only as a forum for debate, but also as the platform from which to push "two basic goals."
For example, Her Majesty explained that the goal is that by the end of 2015 there will be 175 million poor families who have access to these financial services and that one hundred million of these families will move out of the poverty line in which they now live.
The impetus in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "followed the path initiated a few years ago in a pioneering way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized Queen Sofía as a "act of justice and due recognition."
And she described the father of this instrument as "an admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty," whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about her lending policy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "at each meeting I was able to see a continuous evolution," explained His Majesty, whose relationship with this project brought him yesterday the qualification of "head of family" meeting in Valladolid from the "banquer des pauvres."
Finally, Queen Sofía ended her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions for progress in the fight against poverty.
"Erotic imperative"
Minister of External Affairs Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for any democratic state.
In this sense, she explained that it would be a mistake to winch cooperation with developing countries at times of economic prosperity, as this is a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez considered that microcredit implies "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to the eradication of poverty," and now "more than ever" the governments of the developed countries must work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be the victim of the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to the "excluded people to whom all close the door"; and the Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors contaminated with solidarity spirit."
CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday 14 November, in Leipzig, took place without real difficulty for Angela Merkel, Chancellor but also President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially foreseen in the programme but was imposed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who consider the government's policy to be too lax to the Greeks today and perhaps to the Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes after their speeches, Angela Merkel, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very European Minister of Finance, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the Chancellor - and the motion - is a slogan: the response to the crisis "is not less of Europe but more of Europe."
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro."
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could result in amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union's control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage "in order to give Europe a face."
This is in any case one of the proposals of the motion adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that the Twenty-Seven will agree quickly on this revolution: Britain is hostile to it and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the milestone is set.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the weight of each country in the Executive Board of the European Central Bank according to the weight of each economy, which was obviously tantamount to strengthening the weight of Germany.
In an attempt to calm the climate within her party, the Chancellor made many references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she also did not seek to win her congress on the backs of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty that were quick to criticize Germany's arrogant.
While the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "Franco-German friendship," Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Except in hollow.
Recalling that two centuries ago, Leipzig had been at the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What is fraud at sick leave?
After the benefits, the UMP and the government launch the offensive on sick stoppages.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund, and deliver a speech on the theme - recurrent since 2007 - of the fight against social fraud and assistance.
And to accompany this offensive, which starts from a desire to make savings in a context of rigour, but is no less heralding an axis of the presidential campaign to the right, the majority wants to focus on sick stoppages.
Firstly, with a view to budgetary savings: the government plans to impose a fourth day of default on private employees before taking over a work stoppage.
Clearly, without a specific business agreement, an employee who falls ill would lose four days' pay, so at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that could provoke anger, but which would bring in 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
And that would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic in scope: to impose on civil servants a day of non-compensable default in the event of a stoppage of work (so far they have no waiting period, compared with three days in the private sector).
While these issues are under discussion, the majority also relaunches the issue of fraud, this time targeting abuses linked to work stoppages.
"The controls will be much more important and, if you are caught, you will pay back," said Xavier Bertrand at the RTL microphone on Sunday, November 13.
As in other cases, the advertising effects appear to be somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraud at work stoppages.
Since 2002, it has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, most of which have borne fruit.
The French are no sicker than elsewhere in Europe.
Let us start by looking at the national figures.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than €237 million of daily allowances were issued in 2006.
According to the Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, daily allowances accounted for 5% of health expenditure in 2008, at €11.3 billion.
Of this amount, 46% concerned maternity leave and accidents at work, and 54% concerned sick leave, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
And so 2.5% of health spending.
In 2010, the French experienced an average of 14.5 days of work stoppage, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
An average that conceals clear discrepancies: another survey, published in 2007 by the career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed said they had not taken any sick days off.
Another study, this time from the Health Insurance, states that in 2010, 37% of sick stoppages were of less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% beyond.
When compared with their European neighbours, French employees are no more prone than elsewhere to work stoppages.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence rate (for health reasons or not) in France ranged from 10% to 11%, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sick-stop fraud represents very little in the face of undeclared work.
Fraud is only a small problem.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has meant that checks are systematic on sick stoppages of more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 carried out for short-term stoppages were "unjustified or too long," i.e. 37,050 cases.
For stoppages of more than 45 days, which were systematically monitored, 11% of the 1.2 million, or 132,000, cases were "inadequate or unjustified."
In total, therefore, 169 000 "unjustified" cases, out of several million employees who have had a sick leave.
A figure which represents very little face to face, for example, with that of black work.
According to MP UMP Dominique Tian, author of a report on the issue in June, it would represent EUR 9-15 billion in tax losses per year, more than the total cost of daily allowances, and therefore infinitely more than fraud.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment programme to restore its economy.
This was stated by the Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, in Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days given to his government of union would not be enough to accomplish this task.
"In order to continue efforts to restore the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the head of government, who was delivering his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the euro area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's participation in the euro area "is at stake," he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the government deficit in the country would be reduced "to around 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, on Monday supported the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis but warned that his party would not commit to additional austerity.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting with the deputies of his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt, and combating waste but hostile to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary EUR 8 billion loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
It is necessary to legalize euthanasia and assisted suicide, says a committee of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in the denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to talk to their doctor about the conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements.
This was one of the findings of a major Royal Society of Canada report, which involved six experts in a variety of fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia, where appropriate, to be made available to a patient who is deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the outset, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
While Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, report experts commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire of most Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them eventually die in hospital.
Overall, this rate is highest in Quebec, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that contradict the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change the Criminal Code with respect to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who also reviewed all countries where these approaches are legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide on unskilled or unconsenting persons.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, said yesterday in a teleconference, there would be more cases of such overflows precisely in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized.
"Euthanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal," says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
It should be recalled that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it would help end-of-life people alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not send the message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are less valuable.
As for those who had committed assisted suicide, 41 per cent felt that they should not be prosecuted.
The situation regarding the maintenance or cessation of care with a patient is less clear, the authors of the report say.
In addition, in the list of their recommendations, they suggest that the Criminal Code should state that withdrawal of care for which there has been a legally valid refusal is not criminal.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect a denial of end-of-life care, without fear of criminal prosecution.
In the area of palliative care, the Committee calls for governments, health care institutions, and physicians to work together to ensure better palliative care beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with respect to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Committee requests that it be considered, when it is not used to reduce physical pain, as euthanasia, and that it be subject to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already expressed reservations about the findings of the Royal Society of Canada expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described as "extreme" the position of the experts who signed the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to terminally ill people.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who is tired of life and over 18 years of age could ask for help to commit suicide," said Mr. Deschamps, who had consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all other values that participate in the social fabric of society.
"In society," he said, "there are beacons and constraints."
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong opposition" to the findings of the report, which she described as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, specifically challenges the report's data on the lack of abuse in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, either in the Netherlands or in Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to leave power
Damascus denounces a "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Diplomatic pressure intensified yesterday on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, with Russia's support, resists and denounces a "plot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took a stand in favour of the departure of President Assad.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "leave power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime forces were still killed.
"If Bashar had the interest of his country at heart, he should resign, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbour, in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, the head of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davutoglu, deplored the failure of Turkish mediation efforts with the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country for which Turkey is adopting an increasingly harsh line.
The United States, for its part, welcomed a "strengthening of the consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough tone in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesperson for the State Department.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces died in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory (OSDH) announced.
Two other civilians died "during shelling and shelling with heavy machine guns in Jobar" in the besieged town of Homs, according to this NGO.
At a press conference, however, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem said that the country was "heading towards the end of the crisis."
He also reacted strongly to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from its work, which he said was "a dangerous step."
Syria "will not bend," he added, assuring that "the plots against Syria will fail."
Following its decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now considering a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and is seeking the deployment of 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé also supported the sending of UN observers to help protect civilians from the regime's crackdown, which he said was locked in the "paranoia."
A further extraordinary meeting of the League is planned tomorrow in Rabat to take stock of the implementation of the crisis recovery plan decided on 2 November, including the withdrawal of the armed forces from contested cities and the release of arrested demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday found the Arab League's decision "incorrect," while China urged Syria to implement the crisis recovery plan, while not supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti asks for time in the markets and sacrifices in the Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for some time to form his team and implement a program, which will contain "sacrifices," in order to recover the credibility lost in the last few months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before he met today with the trade unions and employers.
It should set up a relatively small cabinet composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, Member of Parliament for one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in the talks, after meeting the President-designate.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expected Mario Monti to seek a vote of confidence in Parliament by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will conclude with the presentation by Mr Monti of a shortlist, probably of a dozen ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness of the stock and bond markets, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are clear deadlines" for preparing a government and its agenda, he stressed, saying "sure that markets will be patient and understand."
His appointment by the President had initially been welcomed by the markets, but the concern resumed the upper hand, particularly after an unexpected fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister-designate should set up a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to include "policies."
The new government is expected to last until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will gain Parliament's confidence by Friday.
Mr Monti undertook, once he took office, to work urgently and with the aim of "rebecoming a protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesperson for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change."
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budgetary balance target in 2013 despite austerity plans adopted in recent months, has called for further tightening measures.
The "boss of Italian bosses" Emma Marcegaglia, who will see him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to revive the economy, "because a country that has no growth can not respect the deficit parameters."
Mr Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconism," the "professor" symbolising "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy," according to the editorialists.
The great unknown will be the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put EUR 200 billion in government bonds by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran's nuclear programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran develop a detonator that could be used with a nuclear weapon, said on Monday an American NGO specializing in atomic risk.
The Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) relies on the recent report of the International Atomic Security Agency (IAEA) and other documents from that United Nations agency to identify this researcher.
Last week, the IAEA expressed its "serious concerns" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades from the 1960s at a Soviet military nuclear centre in Chelyabinsk (Ural), and was involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he reportedly left the centre to establish a diamond-producing company in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He subsequently cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before his return to Russia.
In its last report, the IAEA refers to "strong indications that Iran's development" of a nuclear detonation system "was assisted by the work of a foreign expert, who not only was familiar with this technique, but who, as one Member State informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on this technology within the military nuclear programme of his country of origin."
Anti-Muslim crimes and offences increased by 50%
Crimes against Muslims increased by almost 50 per cent between 2009 and 2010, while other racial and religious violence decreased or increased slightly, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violence perpetrated against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49 per cent, compared with a 13 per cent increase in violence against Catholics, a 4 per cent decrease in crimes against Jews and an overall 14 per cent increase in anti-religious crimes and offences.
The total number of "hate crimes" increased slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% were motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offences increase again," Human Rights First stressed, "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, must be seen as a serious violation of human rights," said Paul Legendre, head of the organization.
"The US government can and must do more to tackle these abuses," he added, saying that this could involve improving police reporting on "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the era of civil rights struggle.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violence related to race, skin colour, religion, origin and now gender.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter micro-blogging site introduced changes in the presentation of its platform, allowing its users to observe the activity of those they follow, making its service a bit more like that of Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and a "name" tab allow you to follow the activities of other "twittos," the users whose messages are followed ("tweets") and the ones that follow you.
This allows us to know if they send messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new Twitter format was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before being broadcast to the entire network on Monday, said AFP Twitter spokesperson Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with somewhat esoteric terms (RT to rebroadcast a message from someone else, # followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making it the happiness of the insiders, opens up to a wider audience with a handling more comparable to that of the mainstream Facebook and Google + networks.
On the network, users were discussing the value of this innovation in sharp "tweets."
"It's useless, invasive, and it looks too much like Facebook," writes @ jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed," sent @ dannykronstrom.
Austria
inclusion of a budgetary "golden rule" in the constitution
The government of the leading social-democratic / Christian-democratic coalition in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a "golden rule" in order to reduce public deficits and thus avoid any deterioration by the rating agencies of Austria's sovereign rating (triple A).
It was Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the end of a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt was 74.6%, well above the 60% ceiling set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's creditworthiness were to be reduced by a single margin, from AAA to AA +, we would have to pay an additional €3 billion in interest each year," argued Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is thus responding to a request from the Brussels summit of the euro area countries of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government then called for the reduction of public deficits and a return to the balance of public accounts in the constitution or in a law of the same value by the end of 2012.
The arrangements adopted by the Austrian Government are similar to the "German model," since Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule."
By 2017, the structural government deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal government will not have to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while regional states and municipalities will have to present balanced budgets.
The aim is to bring public debt under the 60% criterion laid down in the Maastricht Treaty by 2020 / 21.
Yen fort
Noda threatens new foreign exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would again intervene in the foreign exchange market if the yen were to continue to rise.
"We will intervene as we did last time if we see excessive volatility in the yen's exchange rate," said Mr. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen was not far from the historical levels that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars in order to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just set a new record of strength since 1945 against the green bill.
But the yen has been steadily rising since then, driven by purchases from investors who regard it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and Europe's debt crisis.
The dollar went back on Tuesday under the 77 yen and the euro fell below the symbolic bar of the 105 yen, close to the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This upsurge in the Japanese currency is detrimental to the archipelago's exports as it increases the cost of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of foreign revenues by Japanese firms when they convert them into national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild itself" since the earthquake and tsunami of 11 March that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), stressed Mr. Noda who fears that this increase in the price of the yen will kill the fragile recovery in the egg.
The third largest economic power in the world resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to a rebound in exports and consumption of disaster-stricken households.
But the Prime Minister found that the high value of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals."
Finance Minister Jun Azumi, for his part, called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened on Tuesday a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible steps to weaken the yen.
But the deputy governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "appropriate measures," suggesting that no further monetary easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of treasury bills by 5 000 billion yen (EUR 47 billion), bringing the ceiling on its purchases of various financial securities to 55.000 billion yen (EUR 519 billion) to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
rates are rising, stock exchanges are flanking
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to undermine European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of fragile countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, the European stock exchanges are getting a little deeper into negative territory on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10am, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt gave in 0.4% and London 0.1%.
"With the new tensions on the bond yields of euro area states in difficulty, equity markets around the world continue to make some of their recent gains."
"Investors are nervous and are only too aware of the risk of contagion," says Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed down by 0.7%, suffering in turn from renewed fears from market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, is looking at Europe and trade will continue in a corridor of narrow variations until investors have proof that the situation is stabilized," says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This renewed concern about the future of the euro area penalises the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At around 10am, the European currency was worth $1.3570, down 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it declined after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, met in congress on Monday, adopted a motion which included the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates well above 6%
The borrowing rates of Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian bonds at the age of 10 reached 6.85%, that of Spanish securities of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the speakers.
The head of the future Italian government Mario Monti has asked the markets for time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened with asphyxiation by the weight of his debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October would be his government's "main task."
Spain finds itself in the spotlight of markets, as parliamentary elections in the country take place on Sunday.
The spread between the 10-year bonds of Germany and Spain has reached a new historic level.
Waiting for euro area growth figures
On the statistical side, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, driven by household consumption.
However, the Insee revised the figure for the second quarter downwards, with a 0.1% decline in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
And it's really the fourth one that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first estimate for the euro area as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., when the European Commission has warned against the risk of a further recession.
Energy policy:
the facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of businesses.
It is healthy for an election to be an opportunity to reflect on such issues and the place that nuclear power has in them.
The debate will be fruitful only if it explores the full range of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
With 7 billion people on the planet, demographic change will lead to a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources will have to be addressed in order to continue to produce electricity at all times, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, a subject that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident does not alter any of these parameters.
That is why Germany remains isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case for Belgium, which is subjecting its own to the need to be able to find an alternative source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which is just planning to build only last generation power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue their projects with determination.
The United States, after Fukushima, decided to add a unit to their park by resuming the construction of a power plant that was interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
While the German model, which focuses on renewable energies, is sometimes presented as an example, reality makes discourse difficult.
The choice of Berlin will result in an increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence by the increased use of imported gas, particularly from Russia, a rise in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of gas and coal-fired power stations.
In a few months, all these unfortunate effects are already being felt.
The case of Denmark is to be pondered.
Europe's wind power champion, from which he draws 30% of his electricity, he is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; by this reason, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the other hand, thanks to our constant energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than French households.
While in a globalised economy the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining the industrial tool on national territory, French companies benefit from Europe 's cheapest electricity.
As a result, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would lead to a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would make the beautiful declarations on the reindustrialisation of our country and the defence of purchasing power illusory.
A price which a large majority of French people refuse to pay, especially since they do not show any opposition in principle to this energy, the polls show.
It should be recalled that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industrial sector of 125 000 direct jobs and 410 000 induced jobs.
Strongly exporting, it brings a galaxy of SMEs specialized in international markets and makes them very job-creating non-relocatable.
If France were to decide to break out of nuclear power, it would sacrifice many of these SMEs by reducing the annual 6 billion euros of French nuclear equipment and services exports.
Which electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years while the decline of its manufacturer would be programmed?
In order to solve the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no miracle source of electricity production, nor is there any diabolical source of electricity.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is evidence of the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear power, maintaining the highest level of safety is an absolute imperative.
We have in France a Safety Authority which exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing power plants as well as the Flamanville yard.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are inhabited by the same obsession of safety.
In half a century, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, intervened under normal operating conditions; it remained without human or environmental consequences.
At Chernobyl, the design of the reactor and unforgivable human faults caused the tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude that killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
As a result of this approach and cooperation between the safety authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a concept that makes it capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is considered by all electricians willing to build a power plant, the shutdown of its construction in Flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of Areva and EDF by giving them the free way to seize the leadership in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is essential and legitimate to seek the best energy mix for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvers dominate such a crucial debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles - congestion of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the statistics policy, compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "country of human rights."
More recently, it was the administrative harassment of foreign students that was the subject of the news, with the Minister of the Interior (read Liberation of 23 May) proclaiming that France "does not need foreign talent, masons and restaurant servers."
But it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a fairly broad consensus on this subject between the left and the right.
On the right, the tone was set by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country with nearly 2 million immigrant workers," and on the left by Michel Rocard, who explained that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared on the left as well as on the right.
For both sides, immigrants are seen as a burden on the French economy and society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that will be accorded to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande confines himself to triviality, indicating that co-development will solve our "migration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may pay for it electively, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in a recent book summarizing the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
Restricting immigration anemia growth and harms employment.
Concerns about the impact of migrants are based on the idea that migrants may replace national workers, especially the low-skilled, who exert downward pressure on their wages.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are much more complementary than substitutes for national employees, mainly engaged in occupations in sectors where there is a shortage of jobs.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national employees, and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not keep up with the supply of jobs.
A positive effect on wages
Just as it will be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country with a shortage of anaesthetists, these complementarities between nationals and migrants make the arrival of immigrants have a positive effect on the salaries and employment of nationals.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows results in an increase of between 0.6 and 0.9% in real wages over the long term.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among the American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems, averaging 1% of the total budget in European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organisation estimates that, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (revenue less expenditure) of EUR 150000 to public budgets on average over his or her entire life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of his term, to look for missing growth points "with his teeth."
The teeth in question, by being used to deter immigrants, had the exact opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, remains to think European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset; it is also a fragile asset.
The European continent should be able to remember him, who, for having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, experienced throughout the 20th century the tragedies of the Great War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that it would be enough, for democracy to triumph over its enemies once and for all, to exercise the vote, and to exercise it in the most direct way.
Since Napoleon "Le Petit," we know that this was an easy thought.
Universal suffrage, in order to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not enough and can even be made "an instrument of oppression," as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis in Europe we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is also, first and foremost, a crisis of politics and democracy.
The palinodia of the true-false Greek referendum has had the value of double revealing in this respect: that of the need for a powerful return of politics, but also that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have now shifted, and for many of them Republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain from demanding a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and in scattered order.
A white-seing to the European absolute monarch or a paired foot jump in the void of the nationalist retreat: what a choice for the citizen!
No, we do not want cutlets, but we want a common exercise, of right, serene and continuous, of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - there is no place to stop the enumeration - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is Europe as a whole that is bent on the dictates of markets and credit rating agencies, which suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is humiliated on the international stage.
There is concern about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
The urgent need is to give back to popular sovereignty the leadership of the European project.
It is together that Europeans will be able to reduce their debt burden, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing.
The end of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, except, of course, to lead us to disaster.
After a long time of fighting this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for the European Economic Government.
All right.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as such by the citizens, would be a new madness and a new impasse.
We must take on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To make the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" Republicans.
The revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lesson remains valid.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe politically, a true European people's sovereignty.
To make Europe, let us make Europeans.
"contactless" smart cards are becoming more widespread
The world smart card show opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
The year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor cards (credit card, telephone with SIM card...), to more than 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most promising segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or pay for your purchases by simply approaching a reader's card.
This year, 460 million contactless smart cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million a year ago!
Their share is expected to increase further in 2012 (580 million units expected) and to account for almost 10% of the overall smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Long behind the Asia-Pacific region, Europe is gaining ground for contactless payment.
Some 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 Visa contactless cards have been deployed.
But the large surfaces put double mouths.
Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCard cards this year.
To move up a gear, banks must now equip their customers.
"Two major French establishments have committed themselves to systematically distribute to their customers in the future bank cards equipped for contactless users," announces Gérard Nébouy, General Manager Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Few devices are now equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required for transactions.
"They're late."
"But they should finally see a real boom next year."
"We expect 80 to 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012," says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
The Agricultural Credit announced yesterday the launch of a test from December to June in Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale, too, said yesterday to prepare for the placing on the market of an offer allowing its customers to pay without contact with their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is spreading
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qa'idah in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the al-Qa'idah terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram are confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria's Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even said that Algiers has now "acquired certainty."
"The way the two organisations operate and intelligence reports show that there is good cooperation," he explained without any more precision.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the abduction of two French men in Niger last January would have revealed bridges.
Kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by relatives of Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the next day together with several of their kidnappers in an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators had to find several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of past appeals focuses on several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two issues are of particular interest to investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who has spent a long time in Maiduguri, a town in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who claims to be close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must probably wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"It has been known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active," warns Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months these "supports" had been increasingly evident in Boko Haram's development and speeches or in his operating procedures, which now involve the use of increasingly complex suicide bombers or explosive devices, and in the same way as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has therefore put pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened people of little interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - meaning in Haussa "Western education is a sin" - advocates the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim North of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association has been a quick success.
It politicizes itself and demands strict respect for sharia law, while its militants engage in the fight against the unholy central government.
The latter are primarily aimed at churches, bars and administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, increasing attacks on police stations.
The reaction of Abuja is, as usual, without nuances.
The army invades the city, there are 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was arrested alive, was killed in prison.
From then on, the sect will radicalize and leave its northern fiefs.
Last Christmas, she claims an attack that killed 80 people in Jos, and then another one in Abuja.
In June, it was again in Abuja that Boko Haram attacked the secure police headquarters during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations will be its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would sail from Mauritania to Somalia and through Nigeria, is now a matter of concern to all security professionals.
While Aqmi has invested Mali and Niger, which al-Shabab Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Haram appears to be a new threat to the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned against Boko Haram and said he was ready to "share all the information."
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry compete for simplicity and ignorance.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple, even simplistic ideas?
By listening to Republican presidential candidates, voters might believe it.
For the past few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the others have been multiplying the vivid statements and shortcuts in foreign policy, traditionally a republican strong point.
On China, on Iran, on aid to Israel, the slogans - often unsubstantiated - are raging.
Mitt Romney, best placed in the race for the "Grand Old Party," threatened to drag the Chinese to the WTO and challenge them "for manipulating their currency," a promising theme in an America exasperated by the migration of entire parts of its industry to Asia.
Too bad if it involves the outbreak of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama's ex-ambassador to China and the only candidate for a sophisticated foreign policy vision, nearly strangled himself in the face of an attitude that "flatters" emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stagnating in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
Like Reagan
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if the sanctions fail to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second best placed candidate, shows an embarrassing lack of knowledge of the files.
Recently, he called to counter China's military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop a nuclear capability" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has held the military atom since 1964!
Texas governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to engage the US army in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate of 2008, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
The opponents of the current president replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They recall that Obama himself was an amateur and that he had to put water in his wine in the matter of anti-terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq, on his procrastination in Libya, thus sticking him a weak label.
But the attack isn't that easy.
The public is quite positive about Obama's national security record, which eliminated bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to stalling.
And by arguing that America needs to be rebuilt economically to resurrect its leadership, Obama strikes more just.
The North Stream, the new Russian gas gateway in Europe
The North Stream gas pipeline, directly linking Western Europe and Russia to the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has entered into operation.
It must supply gas for the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event brilliantly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, took part last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between orchestra and fine buffet, at the inauguration of the Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that connects Russia directly with Germany under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the wheel of the valve controlling the entry of Russian gas into the West European network.
With this new gas pipeline, an additional 27.5 billion cubic metres of Russian gas will arrive each year in Western Europe via an initial 1,224 km tube connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second tube is due to be completed by the end of 2012, delivering a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to all French consumption.
And we are already talking about the possibility of building a third on the same route.
For Gazprom, the completion in time and time of this huge construction project has the air of victory.
The project had been strongly contested by Poland and the Baltic countries.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding any ground passage through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
As a result, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is becoming more difficult for them to weigh on Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw had not hesitated to compare North Stream with a "new German-Soviet pact," referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means whether the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting this Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But it is at the cost of a weakening of the energy Europe, since the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in overcoming its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich western countries, which are heavily gas-consuming and whose deposits are in decline.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that binds us organically," confirmed François Fillon by inaugurating this gas pipeline, demonstrating how political and economic the major gas contracts are.
All this explains the wide smiles displayed by Gazprom's leaders, present in numbers in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is made of concrete-sheathed steel to protect it from ships' anchors.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the Second World War.
"A hundred people had to be kidnapped or destroyed as a precaution," says Jens Müller, spokesperson for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to step up measures to protect fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake, heavy like 242 Eiffel towers, which nothing interrupts throughout its length: neither valve nor maintenance station.
A monitoring platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project did not do so while the Swedes were reluctant to see a Russian state-owned company set up permanently off their coasts.
"In case of damage, we stop the gas passage in less than a minute," says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas contained in the pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the manufacturers who have planned the welds for a leak every 100,000 years.
The condition of the pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device circulating inside the pipeline.
From the shape of a cigar, it is introduced inside the tube, one metre in diameter, and it is pushed by gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of 3 meters second, he provides accurate information on possible metal deformations.
The pipeline was designed to operate for 50 years without having to undergo any repairs.
The circulation of the gas is simply ensured by the pressure.
It's 200 bars at the start, and 100 at the finish.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have set up a joint venture, Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It has its headquarters in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased to the company, for 20 years renewable, the entire gas transport capacity.
"Gazprom will pay for total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas actually transported," says Jens Müller.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was 30% by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of the works is expected to reach EUR 7.4 billion for both tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure to pay their costs, since only Gazprom assumes the risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin, on a sandy coastline planted with pine trees.
Valves, 4.5 meters high, form the gas outlet.
Sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specificities of the incoming gas before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour that passes.
At full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskin, a notebook.
Created about 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskin wants to give back the taste of writing.
It has a scent of adventures, hours spent writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskin notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic, broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskin notebook as we know it today was born... in 1997.
Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook of notes.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, is responsible for the launch of the new product.
The notebook is based on an old production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a varnish cotton used to cover banquettes, for example.
This type of notebook was very popular with writers and travellers.
"Moleskin has restored to the taste of the day an old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists, until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the head of the brand at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% to the previous 12.7 million pieces.
We are far from the confidential production of the first few years, where only 3,000 notebooks were designed.
Moleskin crosses Italian borders and exports to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to draw up a sketch of the buyer, as the notebook seduces the businessman as well as the student and the professionals.
Like Moleskin, its consumers are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The Italian small business, which had 12 employees at its beginning, now has almost 100 employees and has two offices since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small downtown shops and has been able to impose her identity.
"We have followed the air of time and this new need for writing, despite the growth of e-mails," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of Moleskin: recently, the brand launched an exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, calendar, pens, computer covers... The brand is available on a wide range of media.
An envious success: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskin.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week for the employment of the disabled opens today.
Despite a pro-active public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for persons with disabilities is still twice the average: 19%, compared with 9% for the general population.
Discouraging?
"No," says Eric Blanchet, Managing Director of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for the employment of the disabled. "
"The progress made over the past 15 years has been considerable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"However, much remains to be done."
It must be said that for the unemployed with disabilities, there are still many obstacles before they can enter employment.
They are rather older: 37% are over 50 years of age (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree and out of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, long-term unemployment is widespread: 53 per cent for the disabled, compared with 38 per cent on average.
In short, all these criteria make it particularly difficult to return to work and "constitute the crux of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Managing Director of Treplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
That's for objective brakes.
The unsaid, the attitudes that are changing, certainly, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité indicated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disability," with an "overrepresentation of persons in wheelchairs, psychic or intellectual disabilities."
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the employment target of 6% of disabled workers set out in a law of... 1987.
The latest known figures, which date back to 2008, show a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Managing Director of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: the number of "taxed" establishments, as well as the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, especially in large groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of establishments with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers, compared with 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "Only happiness"
Before facing the Blue Tuesday night (8: 45 p.m.) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens did not hide the pleasure that this friendly match gives them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was connivance between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the stage of the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard did make peace.
Five months after his attacker's move in the mood against Turkey, the Belgian breeder has nothing but praise for him.
"I am very pleased with Eden, her progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to move forward," says the Lillois.
As for the contrast between his performances in club and in selection, "it is a whole, he justified himself."
"In Lille, I am there all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I have to take my marks."
Met against Romania on Friday night in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
Without omitting, however, the notion of "pleasure."
The Bleus, he has encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supportive," he says.
Of course, this contributes to further strengthening the "special" nature of this meeting.
Especially as on the other side, "there is Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"We met earlier."
"To be able to play against them is only happiness!"
With Bonhomie, Leekens, for his part, spoke of "pride."
"Proud" to fight "a gala game."
"Proud" also to note - as a "neighbour" - that France has "returned to a very high level team" just over a year after Knysna's trauma.
"Laurent Blanc did a thunder job," he was excited.
While Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technician would be able to share the plane with the Blue... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are getting big," he stressed.
"We're building something, players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will see this at the next matches." The one against France included.
Portugal is very confident
Portugal of Paulo Bento starts with a lot of optimism its dam back against Bosnia (22: 00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
By the way, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already there, in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no shadow of doubt, the Selecçao, of which he has been at the controls since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Portugal is indeed only 90 minutes away from happiness.
But there is a game to play, and an opponent, Bosnia, to unfold.
In view of the match go (0-0), Friday in Zenica hell, it seems obvious that the games are not done.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, but it was unable to score this precious goal, which would have relieved it.
"It's a good result, but it has a certain risk because we haven't scored any goals outside."
But at home, in their bright Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to pass, in front of an audience that should be there as hot, even if the game is obviously "very tight," dixit an optimistic but lucid Bento.
"We expect a very tight match, but we are quite convinced that we can take the lead," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of being at the Euro 2012," relativised Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw reported on Friday from Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for Bosniacs, who also need to score.
"It's a good result, but it has a certain risk because we haven't scored any goals outside," says Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a lot of technical qualities and has players with a lot of individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will have the intention of putting as much pressure on the Bosniacs as possible in order to "not give them time to think."
A good idea, provided you're realistic this time.
