Rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar trend in the European Union / European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
In Italy's experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care services need to prepare for a peak of COVID-19 patients in need of care, particularly intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centre for Disease Prevention and Control designated the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
To date, approximately 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild condition, i.e., respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are cured.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 results in a more severe condition requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% develop a serious form of the disease requiring intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4%.
In this study, we assess the cumulative impact of COVID-19 in each of the European Union countries / European Economic Area (EU / EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK), and compare it with the evolution of Hubei Province in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom with that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that COVID-19 was a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
Within the EU / EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in persons returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in each of the 30 EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 reported cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and that date, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining Cumulative Number and Cumulative Incidence of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported in each country around the world, obtained only from official sources such as ministries of health, national and regional health authorities in different countries and WHO, is updated daily at 08: 00.
These data were used to assess the evolution of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare with the experience of Italy.
In order to assess the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases at 14 days, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19, within each EU / EEA country and in the United Kingdom, for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the cumulative number of reported cases in each country on 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. with the data from Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom
The cumulative 14-day incidence of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom generally followed that of the province of Hubei (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU / EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February before a drastic increase around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional data).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to the data for Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
As of 8: 00 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is rapidly increasing in the EU / EEA and the UK.
Changes in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a comparable rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and that there are differences in the responses of national public health services, potential variations in case definitions and differences in patient selection protocols to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including for catch-up tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy reported that about 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases to hospitals and / or intensive care services are currently available at EU / EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not presented).
There is, however, a need for systematic collection to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a significant gap in the number of beds available in intermediate and intensive care services in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds per 100,000 individuals in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 individuals in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios for the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU / EEA and UK countries of the prevalence of hospitalized COVID-19 cases associated with risk & gt; 90% exceedance of ICU bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the COVID-19 rapid risk assessment of CEPCM.
Since cases were previously grouped in certain regions of the EU / EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care services generally have a defined regional population, data on cases and beds in intensive care should preferably be compiled at level 2 of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS 2).
Italy's experience and current developments in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly within the EU / EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care services must therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario for SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients in need of care, and in particular intensive care, as in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted by the recent rapid risk assessment of the ECDC, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of VOCs-2-SARS, moving from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid and early increase in the number of cases may not allow enough time for decision makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing had been implemented upstream.
Rapid risk assessment also identifies public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window during which each country can strengthen its control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health services.
Otherwise, it is likely that health systems in other EU / EEA countries will have to cope with a peak of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far resulted in more than 3,000 deaths and infected more than 80,000 people in China and around the world, causing a humanitarian disaster.
Like its counterpart, SARS-CoV, which led to thousands of SARS cases in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and men more than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide a timely and comprehensive review of this growing research topic.
We will address the fundamentals of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will help to better understand and eradicate this serious disease.
The Spring Festival, on January 25, 2020, marked for ever the Chinese, who were forced to remain shut for the entire golden week as well as for many other weeks due to the spread of a new viral disease.
The virus is highly homologous to coronavirus (CoV), which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the associated disease known as coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan and spread rapidly to all of China before spreading to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients hospitalized and more than 3,000 deaths.
For WHO, COVID-19 is "the number one public enemy," potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https: / / www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov / pubmed /), in less than two months, more than 200 works have been published on COVID-19, including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 presenting the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review attempts to synthesize the progress of research on this growing new topic.
As soon as possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another coronavirus disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak that occurred in 2012).
We will also take stock of what we have learned so far in terms of disease prevention and prognosis, and will address some outstanding but urgent issues.
Coronavirus are traditionally considered non-fatal pathogens for humans, causing mainly about 15% of common colds 4.
However, during this century we experienced two highly pathogenic human coronavirus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before spreading rapidly to many other countries with high morbidity and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third coronavirus epidemic in recent history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1.1, outbreaks of pneumonia of unknown origin were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 at the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was revealed.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic had rapidly spread to neighbouring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that healthcare professionals had been infected, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined with an interruption of all public transport.
On January 24, the first clinical study of the disease indicated that out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 patients had been in direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered to be the starting point for infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO described the epidemic as a global health emergency.
At the time of writing, the disease had already spread to all of China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2) .2).
To the extent that the situation is changing rapidly, the final scope and severity of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed cases of COVID-19, presented an updated overview of the epidemic as follows (https: / / mp.weixin.qq.com / s / UlBi-HX _ rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but most of them in the 30-65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected men (0.31 / 100,000) more than women (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 was developed in homes, mainly in and around Hubei Province.
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and diagnosis of COVID-19 was 5 days (2-9).
The mean incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of people infected had increased exponentially until January 23, 2020, coinciding with the massive displacements that took place prior to the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality of patients identified as confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus is a subfamily of large enveloped viruses containing a single strand RNA.
They can be classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, the coronavirus known to infect humans belonging to the alpha and beta genera.
The envelope's Spike (S) glycoprotein binds to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receptors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, followed by membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, genomic RNA accompanied by envelope glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins forms virion-containing vesicles, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, with more than 99.98% genetic identity between 10 sequenced samples taken from the source site of the outbreak, the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using transmission electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in ultra-fine sections of human epithelium in the respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been identified as a SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV receptor.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 less strongly than that of SARS-CoV, coinciding with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short orf3b-encoded protein as well as an orf8-encoded protein.
Orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain known functional domains or motifs.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., presented the complete human ACE2 cryo-ME structure at a 2.9 Å resolution complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was assembled as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S proteins, providing guidance for the recognition and infection of coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for screening drugs to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The original host and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were found to originate from bats and were transmitted to humans via civettes and camelids, respectively.
Following a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were advanced as the native host of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to the two SARS coronaviruses from bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that allowed the virus to cross the species barrier to infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission is yet to be elucidated.
Ji, et al., hypothesized that the virus could have been transmitted from bats to humans by snakes, which would involve homologous recombination within the S. protein.
According to a study conducted by researchers in Guangzhou, China, pangolin - a long-snouted mammal that feeds on ants, often used in traditional Chinese medicine - could be the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology between a coronavirus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% between two genomes is a significant difference, and conclusive results should therefore be expected to establish concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig.33)).
The physico-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 ° C and 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may very well have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and a temperature of 56 ° C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectants, peracetic acid, chloroform and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inactivate the virus.
The human population as a whole is generally immune to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies with other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4) .4).
In general, when a virus infects a host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through molecular pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-lectin receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLR), NOD-type receptors (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells, and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the SARS-CoV N protein may allow the virus to escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4 + T cells stimulate B cells that produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8 + T cells directly eliminate infected cells.
Assisted T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to support defence cells.
However, coronavirus may inhibit T-cell function by inducing apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a as well as antibodies, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a restored patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive reaction of the immune system causes a localized explosion in the number of free radicals, which can result in serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multiorgan failure or even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by outbreaks, is more likely to affect older people with co-morbidities and pregnant women.
It is widely accepted that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to be infected than others.
The mean incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 1-14 days, but more generally 3-7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases reported to Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed an average incubation period of 3 days, ranging from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, found an incubation period of 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that the health authorities adjust the actual duration of quarantine according to the most precise incubation period possible, in order to avoid the transmission of the virus by infected but asymptomatic people.
Generally, people exposed to, or infected with, the virus are quarantined for 14 days.
Should quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is often the first and main symptom of COVID-19, and may or may not be accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnoea and / or hypoxemia one week after the onset of the disease.
In serious cases, patients developed rapid acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and / or respiratory symptoms as well as those with acute fever, even in the absence of chest X-ray abnormalities, should be tested for the virus to allow early diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out at the end of December 2019 showed that patients had 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% dyspnoea and 3% diarrhoea; 8% of patients required ventilatory assistance.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies of a family and an outbreak that occurred as a result of transmission of the virus from an asymptomatic individual.
Similarly, a 2012 demographic study showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients were fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnoea (55%).
However, 80% required ventilatory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients, consistent with higher MERS lethality compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
For SARS, the main symptoms were fever (99% -100%), dry cough (29% -75%), dyspnoea (40% -42%), diarrhoea (20% -25%) and sore throat (13% -25%), and ventilatory assistance was required for approximately 14-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, with 66,576 cases confirmed globally.
In comparison, SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% for 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study conducted in June 2012, mortality was 37% for 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that SARS-CoV-2 R0 was 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while SARS-CoV R0 was only 2-4.
A comparison of the symptoms, mortality, and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV is presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal.
As a result, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak than it was for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks.
An outbreak often occurs within a family or in a rally or vehicle, as in the case of a cruise.
Patients often travelled or resided in Wuhan or other affected areas, or were in contact with infected persons or patients within two weeks of onset of symptoms.
However, it has been shown that individuals may be carriers of the virus without showing symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients reinstated may be carriers of the virus again, underlining the need to increase the duration of quarantine.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (including lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a number of white blood cells & lt; 4 × 109 / L and a number of lymphocytes & lt; 1 × 109 / L, as well as a high level of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were identified in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Some patients had elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood, and most had elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation.
In the most serious cases, the level of D-dimer, a degradation product of fibrin in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes gradually decreased.
There are chest X-ray abnormalities in most patients with COVID-19, characterized by unequal bilateral shadows or depolished glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In the case of SDRA, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise gas exchange.
Dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumocytes results in a decrease in surfactant rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to inflate and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most disturbing chest examinations often coincide with the most severe form of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed pneumocyte desquamation, hyaline membrane formation, interstitial lymphocyte infiltration, and the presence of multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a deceased patient of the disease, which coincided with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA and was similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 via reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the primary endpoint for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which can accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which was no longer solely based on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation had been observed for the diagnosis of SARS.
Thus, the combination of medical history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological examinations is essential to an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technology based on CRISPR technology for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, which identifies synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol / L and 200 × 10-18 mol / L (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a reactive strip within one hour, without requiring sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique will significantly improve sensitivity and practicality if its use on clinical specimens is successful.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians can only provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while testing a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of patients restored, Chinese medicine as well as psychological support.
Even plasma from restored patients has been proposed for treatment.
All pharmaceutical companies are working to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 attacks primarily the lungs initially and probably also, to a lesser extent, other organs expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Nevertheless, respiratory dysfunction and insufficiency are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
For example, respiratory assistance is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives; this includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen therapy, non-invasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OTEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used to treat critical cardiac or respiratory deficiencies.
The maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of vital organ functions are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Excessive immune system response has been shown to cause cytokinic shock in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokinic shock is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a whole series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiorgan failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokinic shocks, especially in serious cases.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokinic shocks.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokinic shock include T-cell modulation of immune response, IFN-γ, IL-1, TNF cytokine blocking, JAK inhibition, blinatumomab, cytokine 4 reporting suppressor, and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, as immunosuppressive agents, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
However, the use of high-dose steroids did not have a beneficial effect on serious lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they would cause serious side effects, including avascular osteonecrosis, which would significantly affect the prognosis.
However, careful use of short cycles of low to moderate dose corticosteroids was recommended for patients with severe COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration of remdesivir, a nucleoside analogue, was effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdésivir is a new antiviral medicine originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdésivir also demonstrated possible inhibition of other single-strand RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on these findings, Gilead transmitted the compound to China to allow for a number of trials in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir / ritonavir and ribavirin have been advanced as potential treatments for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other side effects may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir / ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicinal products used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of patients restored and antibody production
It is an ancestral practice to collect blood from patients who have cured a contagious disease in order to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from the disease.
Patients who have recovered often have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies; they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Plasma was extracted from the blood of a group of patients who cured COVID-19 and injected to 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved in 24 hours, in combination with decreased inflammation, reduced viral load and increased oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to be able to propose this method for large-scale use until a specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some of the drawbacks associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause excessive stimulation of the immune response and cause potentially fatal cytokine release syndrome.
The level of antibodies in the blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat severely ill patients is high.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to fight a global epidemic.
As a result, it is more essential and effective to isolate B cells from restored patients and to identify genetic codes encoding the relevant antibodies or to search for effective antibodies against the main proteins of the virus.
This would allow for a rapid increase in antibody production.
TCM has been used for thousands of years in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are largely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies with the diagnosis, based on TCM theories.
Most effective components remain little or no known at all as it is difficult to extract and verify them, or to know their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific effective treatment of COVID-19, TCM is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or remission of a serious form of the disease.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been shown to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The best rates of COVID-19 cure were observed in provinces in China that used MTC for 87% of their patients, including Gansu province (63.7%), Ningxia region (50%) and Hunan province (50%), while Hubei province, which used only 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a rather rough comparison since many other impact factors, such as patient numbers and disease severity, need to be considered in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his collaborators published a study comparing treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and a combination of MO and MTC.
It was found that the time to return to normal body temperature, the time to dissipation of symptoms, and the duration of hospitalization were significantly shorter for the MO + MTC group than for the MO group alone.
Even more impressive, the rate of worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the MO + MTC group than for the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%); similarly, mortality was lower for the MO + MTC group than for the MO group only (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM remains to be clarified through larger controlled trials and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of action and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their associations, if possible.
Individuals identified as probable or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are generally very concerned about this highly contagious and fatal disease, and those in quarantine also experience a sense of boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment, such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early days of the SARS outbreak, multiple psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, acute confounding and even suicidal tendencies.
Mandatory contact tracing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase anxiety and lead to some guilt of patients towards the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigmatization of their families and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals identified as probable cases, people in contact with these populations, and any other individuals in distress.
This psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic applications and equipment to avoid close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of infected animal reservoirs and humans to vulnerable hosts, and are often complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein vaccines to produce potent neutralising antibodies in the long term and / or to induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live attenuated vaccines were evaluated on animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and in models subject to lethal challenge and their protection against infection with a zoonotic virus remains to be determined, as no clinical studies have yet been initiated.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS died 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-related particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for unimmunized individuals is an urgent and essential objective in order to control the current epidemic.
However, this is a real challenge because of the long time (on average 18 months) needed to develop a vaccine and the dynamic variations in coronavirus.
To the extent that it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 is just beginning its clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients gradually recover without sequelae.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in the most serious cases.
Therefore, establishing a prognosis model is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted to date, the factors that may affect or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients are as follows (Table 33):
Age: age was the main predictor of SARS, and this also appears to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects individuals 30-65 years of age, with 47.7% over 50 years of age according to a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older (median age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting age as a prognosis factor for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have acute cardiac lesions and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has been shown to also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the age and presence of underlying health problems are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage; it has been advanced as a potential prognosis factor for disease, treatment response and cure.
The correlation between CRP levels and severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also contribute to prognosis.
These enzymes are widely expressed in several organs, including the heart and liver, and are released in case of tissue damage.
They are therefore traditionally markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of chest X-ray and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be examined in combination with the other elements for the determination of the prognosis and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunctive treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory lesions.
Since high-dose corticosteroids have been widely used for serious SARS cases, many survivors have experienced avascular osteonecrosis resulting in permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, administration of steroids to patients with COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short duration.
Mental stress: As described above, the COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a large number of cases of exceptional stress, with patients often experiencing long quarantine periods, extreme uncertainty and the deaths of relatives or other patients.
It is imperative to provide long-term counselling and support to help these individuals overcome this stress and return to normal life.
Based on demographic studies conducted to date, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics than SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 also replicates effectively in the upper respiratory tract and produces little or no symptoms in the first phase of infection, like coronavirus causing common colds.
As a result, individuals who are newly infected or incubation can produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, which significantly hampers control of the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV was considered to be transmitted by severely ill patients with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The current COVID-19 epidemic is therefore much more serious and difficult to control than SARS.
Considerable efforts are being made in China, including the containment of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, as well as the continued quarantine of almost all of the population with a view to interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have had a dramatic impact on the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the phase of decline will last from 3 to 4 months.
However, not all experts share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, et al., believe that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not be extinguished in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been detected in samples of the mean nasal cornet and throat of restored patients, 2 weeks after their discharge from hospital, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode like influenza.
However, encouraging signs have been observed in China with the gradual reduction of new cases, suggesting that the strategies implemented would have worked.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, due to strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as with SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 weakens in terms of infectivity and eventually extinguishes or evolves into a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 outbreak with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been identified in stools, revealing a new possibility of fecooral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients found that 41% of cases were possibly due to nosocomial infections, with 17 patients with previous diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Precautionary measures should therefore be taken to protect individuals, including healthcare professionals, social workers, relatives and colleagues of patients, and even any person who may be in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defence to reduce the risk of infection is the wearing of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirators (1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent the projection of potentially infected droplets or their deposition on surfaces, where they could be passed on to other people.
However, only the N95 (1860) masks provide protection against inhalation of virions of 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions capable of fully penetrating; the SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the SARS-CoV in size, since both measure approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles are able to pass through five surgical masks stacked together, it is imperative that health care professionals in direct contact with patients wear N95 (1860s) masks and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear tailored insulation blouses to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect an individual by the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a physician was found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through the eye due to inflammation.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent visors or protective goggles in contact with patients.
For populations in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly recommended to wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than usual, to remain confined to the maximum extent possible and to limit any contact with potentially infected persons.
It is advisable to maintain a distance of one metre with patients.
These measures are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for humans, its high degree of homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must have placed China on high alert after the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reassured the public that the new virus was uncontagious, had limited human transmissibility and would not be difficult to prevent and contain.
This message led to a significant relaxation, particularly as the entire country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies must learn from this and take appropriate action.
For example, these agencies must (1) be more cautious in their public announcements, as each word counts and can affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual clinical data rather than waiting for formal reports from physicians or official agencies; (3) be more restrictive in order to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning rather than trying to reassure the population; and (4) carry out more targeted and relevant exercises to raise awareness of epidemic diseases, but also to regularly test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of writing this report, it has spread to all of China as well as to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 are also close to those of SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic is creating a sense of déjà vu.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which should be taken into account in order to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women; the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is possible even in the absence of symptoms, while SARS was mostly transmitted by severely ill patients, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, patients who have been reinstated may again be positive for the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of spread.
Despite rapid progress in research on COVID-19, a number of critical issues remain outstanding, including:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-type coronavirus from bats, this is not sufficient to conclude with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is derived from chiroptera.
What is the intermediate species that allowed the transmission of the virus from the initial host, for example bats, to humans?
Without answers to questions 1 and 2, transmission cannot be effectively interrupted, and the epidemic can resume at any time.
Molecular modelling and biochemical analyses have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, but how exactly does the virus penetrate into airway cells and how does it cause pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define a rapid and accurate diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during human-to-human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or resurface regularly like influenza?
It is essential, even if it may take time, to get answers to all these questions and many others.
However, no matter how much it costs, we have no choice but to put an end to this epidemic as quickly as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period for these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only rare immunocompromised patients experienced severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
The first case of SARS occurred at the end of 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
In addition to the super-transmitters, it was estimated that each case could produce approximately two secondary cases with an incubation period of 4-7 days, with peak viral load occurring on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory distress as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, distorted liver function tests, and high creatine kinase are common abnormalities observed in laboratory analyses in cases of SARS suspicion.
Diffuse alveolar lesions, epithelial cell proliferation, and increased macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients then require intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be infected in these severe cases, often accompanied by cytokinic shock, which may be fatal especially in immunocompromised patients.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially, it was prevalent in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Coryza, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of this same virus from the nasal removal of an 8-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present throughout the world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man in hospital due to pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present worldwide, causing moderate respiratory diseases.
Generally, when these HCoVs develop the ability to transmit effectively and maintain continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS and are characterized by acute progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed acute renal failure, which is characteristic of MERS compared to HCoV pathologies.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most lethal viruses known to humans.
Diarrhoea is also observed in some patients.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoV revealed very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV diseases are very similar.
In this respect, the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoV.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four community HCoV (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases is also observed as with SARS-CoV, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Finally, like other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in stool samples.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable diffusion after human transmission, will influence the ultimate fate of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
The four community HCoVs causing moderate symptoms were well adapted to humans.
In other words, both may be survivors of previous HCoV pandemics.
For this to happen, HCoV must replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that compensate for host restriction factors.
From this perspective, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic persists and the greater the number of people infected, the more likely it is that the virus will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop by about 40 or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired CoV have been circulating within the population, triggering a simple cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which are highly pathogenic, have not adapted well to humans and their human-to-human transmission is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek an opportunity to reach potential human targets, probably via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-CoV / MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoV.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoV and less pathogenic than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among them without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoV, it will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of HCoV evolutionary hosts, natural hosts, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers.
An animal serves as an evolutionary host of an HCoV if it hosts a nearby ascendant that shares a high homology in the nucleotide sequence.
The original virus has often adapted well and is non-pathogenic to its host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses HCoV on a continuous and long-term basis.
On the other hand, HCoV can also adapt to the intermediate host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
In particular, given that 80% of animals in the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals may also serve as intermediate amplifying hosts cannot be excluded.
These bats are positive for the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept whereby bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
The conversion enzyme of human angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
Despite high homology between these two viruses, WIV1 is generally considered not to be the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
That is why bats cannot be the intermediate reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
In addition, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive to specific antibodies neutralising MERS-CoV, as are camels from the Middle East present in several African countries.
In addition, infected camels excrete the virus not only through the respiratory tract, but also through the faecal route, which is also the main route of excretion of bats.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than the distance between the beta-CoV associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin.
Reconcombination is a widespread factor in the evolution of beta-CoV.
Scientists remain divided on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to the highly pathogenic HCoV, the zoonotic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicates that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may be derived from bat CoV, whereas parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically associated with another bat CoV, called Hipposideros / GhanaKham / 19 / 2008, detected in Ghana, while camelids were also suspected of being intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species barrier to infect humans from domestic livestock around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoV near HCoV-229E was found.
First, unlike alpacas, men can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Next, bat alpha-CoV related to HCoV-229E is numerous and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alpha-CoV has caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in wild animals.
In fact, bats are the direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alpha-CoV is used as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could be used as intermediate hosts transmitting viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-species transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV found in bats is known from its initial identification and has also been reinforced by subsequent discoveries.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been present in dromedaries for decades.
It has adapted well in these camels that have gone from intermediate hosts to stable natural reservoir hosts.
Unlike the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, if they have one, is different.
In particular, pangolin beta-CoV is highly pathogenic in pangolins.
Several possibilities for inter-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2-like virus almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share an ecological niche with bats through scrubbing or coal mines.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts to which a SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the scrubbing and consumption of game meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred within a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
Research on the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Compared to other single-strand RNA viruses, estimated CoV mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average substitution rate of ~ 10-4 substitutions per year per site, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
However, CoV mutation rates are about one million times higher than those of their hosts.
In addition, the mutation rate is often high when the CoV has not adapted well to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is apparently lower, suggesting a higher rate of human adaptation.
It can be assumed that it has already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which has adapted well to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic drift is unlikely to render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective in the short term.
Third, CoV changes randomly and frequently when replicating RNA through a single "choice-copy" mechanism.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found for both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as for animal CoV, such as SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host-virus interaction related to transmission
Beyond these three viral factors, viral interaction with a host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission episodes.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions can be key factors in the adaptation of the virus to humans.
Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the binding affinity of this S protein with human ACE2 may have been altered.
An electron cryomicroscopy study indicates an affinity 10-20 times greater than that observed between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another co-receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Strangely, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different part of the S. protein.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of host proteins between humans and natural HCoV reservoir hosts, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could be a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Emerging new HCoV: back to square one
The diversity of bat CoV offers many opportunities for the emergence of new HCoV.
In this sense, bat CoV are genetic reserves of HCoV.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered important in human adaptation, as the SARS-CoV-related bat viruses were isolated but contained divergent ORF8 proteins.
This removal splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is seen as an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
Combination sites have also been identified in nsp9, in most nsp10, and in some nsp14.
Similarly, the MERS-CoV outbreak has been shown to have experienced episodes of recombination between different lines, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
While ORF4 could be observed in bats and camels associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV exhibits a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between coVs and bats.
Bats appeared to have adapted well to CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "re-reading," which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoV have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that lies the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same immune response dissociation strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, the administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Based on this rationale, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Pangolin beta-CoV was found to be remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very active in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoV circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoV, which has a very high zoonotic potential.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Ongoing monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, while a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or cold can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The primary medical objective of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;
as well as a reduction in the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand-washing with soap.
Pneumonia, one of the leading ARIs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleansing agent for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic materials in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) .A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of lukewarm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated using isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in dry skin if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and / or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and / or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcohol solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect it.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants is highly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulae that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less efficient than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make a difference).
Mousse a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinse in a stagnant water pool can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or open air.
Wet and wet hands recontaminate more easily. The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin causes skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to wash hands when tap water and / or soap are not available. For example, sprinkle water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and / or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended with a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is a debate.
Increasingly, research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
After washing and drying the hands in the hot air hand-dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Air-jet hand dryer drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to the drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
The aim of hand washing in health care facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
after exposure to blood / biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
When rinsing, the water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
For example, in much of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand washing faucets close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of cost-effective options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural change. Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetid odours called miasms.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the washrooms of office buildings and airports.
The term "wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.

Because it's the flu season.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes in virus genomes, most likely as a result of selection pressures, including by the host immune system.
One example is the loss of the complete ORF4 in the prototype strain HCoV-229E due to the deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 could be observed in bats and camels associated with HCoV-229E, alpaca alpha-CoV exhibits a simple nucleotide insertion, resulting in a shift in the reading frame.
Finally, the evolution of the new HCoV is also stimulated by the selective pressure exerted in their reservoir hosts.
Asymptomatic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when bats were infected with CoV, indicating mutual adaptation between coVs and bats.
Bats appeared to have adapted well to CoV from an anatomical and physiological point of view.
For example, abnormalities in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce the pathology triggered by CoV.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed by the positive regulation of the receptor that inhibits natural killer cells NKG2 / CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules from the major class I histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen derivatives (DRO) generated by the high metabolic activity of bats could both suppress CoV replication and affect exoribonuclease "re-reading," which would create selective pressure and result in highly pathogenic viral strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic CoV strains could also evolve through recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three new HCoV have appeared in the last two decades.
CoV are non-pathogenic or cause moderate symptoms in their reservoir hosts such as bats and camels.
They replicate solidly without causing a strong immune response from the host.
It is here that lies the secrets of the observation of asymptomatic carriers and of what causes cases of severe infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokinic shock; the stronger the immune response, the more severe the pulmonary lesions.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was decoupled from CoV replication.
The same immune response dissociation strategy may have beneficial effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to interferon is particularly strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of interferon type I at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be beneficial.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 inflammation is defective in bats.
Based on this rationale, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 appeared following the general pattern by which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV emerged.
While a bat beta-CoV sharing 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV has been discovered, there is also a bat CoV sharing 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While civet and other animals on the market were discovered as carriers of SARS-CoV viruses, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 were identified.
Pangolin beta-CoV was found to be remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolin may be one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-CoV may contribute to the genetic fragments of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 was man-made, either voluntarily or accidentally.
The CoV returned to the spotlight due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoV in bats and other animals has greatly altered our perception of the role of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs in the transmission of HCoV to humans.
Numerous factual data have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from the bat and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is a result of contact between humans and civettes on the market, the closure of fresh product markets and the slaughter of civettes on the market could have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from the fresh product markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, given the discovery of numerous lines of beta-CoV of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals and, if so, how such transmission occurs will remain to be determined in the subsequent studies.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedary for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the premises.
They are very active in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control the MERS, as has been done in the wild animal markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective MERS-CoV vaccines in camels, combined with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several zoonotic CoV circulate in nature.
In particular, bat CoV, which has a very high zoonotic potential.
There are plenty of opportunities for these zoonotic CoV to evolve and merge, leading to the emergence of new, more transmissible and / or lethal CoV in humans in the future.
The cultivation of wild animal consumption in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
In the face of the devastation caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be put in place.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They stay in their own natural reservoirs until there is an opportunity for contagion.
Although bats have many characteristics favourable to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are made aware of the need to stay away.
Ongoing monitoring of mammals is needed to better understand the ecology of CoV and its natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future epidemics.
In conclusion, the most effective way for humans to prevent viral zoonoses is to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonoses.
Not all secrets of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are yet known.
First, if bats transmit a parental SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to observe under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats play a more direct role in human transmission, it would be necessary to determine how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, while a third mammal plays the role of a true intermediate host, it remains to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, are likely to contract SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental contamination should be carried out.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical parent viruses observed in their natural hosts should be identified.
Future research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2 in animals and will have a significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
An update of the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team released a Rapid Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of the New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which described our experience and provided references for the global response to this pandemic.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge are gradually progressing based on the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a comment regarding our guidelines and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria for a "suspect case" and a "confirmed case" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh version) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak that is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called severe acute coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick recommendation that was published online on Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a great deal of attention since its publication.
Please note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are progressing slowly based on the results of ongoing studies and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http: / / www.nhc.gov.cn /) had a total of seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some of which were substantially modified.
Our directive received a comment from Zhou et al., and they submitted a simple evaluation proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work has provided new evidence for our directive and is also a valuable reference for this global pandemic.
We endorse their important work and thank them.
However, their work should also be updated according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version test) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must combine one of the characteristics of the epidemiological history with two elements of clinical manifestations to constitute a complete analysis, or must correspond to three elements of clinical manifestations in the absence of a clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or in other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan or neighbouring areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a confirmed case cluster (≥ 2 cases with fever and / or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks of reduced area such as home, school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and / or respiratory symptoms; (2) imaging with the characteristics of a COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count from the onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on the suspect case with any of the following pathological or serological evidence: (1) real-time positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequencing of the entire viral genome with strong homogeneity with known new coronavirus; (3) positive serological test for the IgM and IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2; or modifying the specific IgG antibody of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or increasing titre ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase compared to the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time PCR test of nucleic acids in the respiratory tract or in blood samples was added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and in the third edition (22 January 2020).
Pathogenic screening of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and fifth edition (8 February 2020); then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes build on the ongoing work of researchers to find an optimal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as respiratory tract samples including blood collection, with increased availability of different specimens, and have contributed to the inclusion of the positive specific antibody result in the confirmed criteria.
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us of caution with respect to atypical symptomatic patients and asymptomatic patients.
As a result, Zhou et al. 's graphic representation should be updated as they classified people without clinical symptoms as "low risk."
The evaluation system should also be verified in clinical practice and in future studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases," we suggest that they follow and follow the most recent guidelines in their country.
Our team will also update our directive in a timely manner to offer its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new COVID-19 deaths, a daily record
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new COVID-19 deaths in a single day.
In this way, the country has a record death rate due to the virus in one day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Surveillance and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected persons recorded included 114 active cases and 33 cured persons, who remained confined to their homes.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
The closure of public transport began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transportation of essential goods (medical supplies, fuel and food) was still permitted.
By March 19, these three people had already recovered.
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 infection worldwide exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
Countries around the world have announced stricter measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the containment of the city until May 1.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics have reversed the trend to reveal how devastating and potentially fatal an HCoV infection can be.
Most HCoVs come from bats in which they are not pathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of human diseases.
The study of host-CoV interactions in animals could also lead to a better understanding of CoV in humans.
Depending on differences in protein sequences, CoV is classified into four genera (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV). The genus Beta-CoV contains the majority of HCoV and is divided into four lines (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents play the role of genetic source for the majority of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
To date, seven human CoV (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The remaining five beta-CoV include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoV provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving forces and limiting factors of crossing the species barrier.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir host (s), intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the prevention of future contagions.
The CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
In recent decades, seven HCoV have been identified.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated in the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and then adapted to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of classical cold, including headache, sneezing, malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both present worldwide and appear to be transmitted mainly in winter in temperate countries.
Australia stores reduce limit quantities of toilet paper per purchase
Sunday and Saturday night, Australian chain stores Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on purchasing toilet paper to two and one package per purchase in all stores nationwide, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits were posted in the form of messages to the cashiers and on the Facebook pages of the channels.
Buyers apparently raised reserves for fear of COVID-19 and the need to confine themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also restricted the purchase of toilet paper for home deliveries to one package per order.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four packages per purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his press release of 8 March, stated that with the restriction of four packages in force, "many stores are still out of stock within one hour of delivery," and called the request "unprecedented," while ALDI, in a Tuesday Facebook publication, called it "unexpected."
Sales increased "sharply" last week, according to a spokesperson from Woolworths.
The Costco store in Canberra also restricted the authorized quantity to two packages last week.
To further reduce the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered an additional stock, while ALDI made stocks available earlier for a promotion scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Association of Retailers, said retailers are trying to increase stocks, but local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of stocks, some stores are not able to honour Wednesday's promotion.
In an article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert in the distribution sector at the University of Technology in Queensland, explained that stores replenish inventory every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a bulky item, resulting in stocks of a small quantity that, once exhausted, leave large spaces empty in rays, reinforcing the impression of a shortage.
"Coles and Woolworths consider [that] if the shelves are full, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants can be [purchased] and are available in large quantities, this will probably reduce panic," explained Russell Zimmerman to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap declared last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who makes Sorbent paper, pointed out that they are working 24 / 7 to maintain supply, according to News.com.au. 's article.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some real estate vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne, while fewer auctions were organized because buyers were on leave during the long weekend of Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a daily newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 ABC Australia report in which they announced that they did not plan to introduce purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products were also in high demand, including masks, disinfectants, dry products, hand hygiene products and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed on Sunday evening that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two packs of 12 rolls.
World Health Organization calls COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2) as a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" refers only to the degree of spread of the disease, not to the dangerousness of specific cases, WHO has indicated the need to push governments to action:
"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, locate and mobilize their populations as part of the response, "said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director General.
"We are deeply concerned, not only by the alarming levels of spread and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction."
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic is "unprecedented."
He stated, in CNN's February comments, that "apart from influenza, no other respiratory viruses have been observed from its onset to its continued global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, stating that "we have never witnessed a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
He added: "and we have never witnessed a pandemic that can be brought under control at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare the epidemic an international public health emergency.
The Director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases of the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the epidemic: "to keep short, the situation will get worse."
On Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an outbreak of coronavirus disease in progress since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute coronavirus 2 syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
Nearly 364,000 people are being healed.
The fatality rate is estimated at 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing your hands, covering your mouth to cough, staying away from others, and monitoring and confining people suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by putting in place travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace risk controls and closure of facilities.
The pandemic has caused serious global socio-economic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages compounded by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 per cent of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been circulating on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination have occurred against Chinese people, other people of Asian origin and appearance in the East and South-East, as well as other people from areas with numerous cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and closures in heavy industry, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan and it is therefore believed that the virus is of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak was known as SARS-CoV-2, a virus recently discovered and closely linked to bats coronavirus, pangolins coronavirus, and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was found that the first known person with symptoms had become ill on December 1, 2019, and that person had no clear connection to the subsequent focus of the fresh product market.
Of the cases of the first outbreak reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to be market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could go back to November 17, 2019, in a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province. On February 26, 2020, the WHO reported that, as new cases appeared to be decreasing in China but suddenly increasing in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a strong underestimation of cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people, 19 years of age and under accounting for 2.4% of the world's cases. UK Chief Scientific Advisor Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population needed to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of persons who were tested at COVID-19 and whose test was confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to test those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that in China, up to 23 January, undetected COVID-19 infections were estimated to be 86%, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 heal.
For those who do not heal, the time between onset of symptoms and death is between 6 and 41 days, the most common being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80 per cent of deaths occurred among those over 60 years of age, and 75 per cent were suffering from pre-existing health problems such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official counts of deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to those who died and were tested positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of actual victims of COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may not include untested deceased individuals - e.g., at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy show that the figures for over-mortality during the pandemic are 4-5 times higher than the official COVID death count.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged "We know that [the number of deaths reported] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotal reports of the under-assessment in the United States. Such underestimation often occurs during pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths per country had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy outside of mainland China.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time that has elapsed since the outbreak began, as well as demographic characteristics such as age, sex, and especially health. The case-death ratio represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed over a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global case-death ratio is 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the case-death ratio estimates decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms occurring between January 1 and January 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms occurring after February 1, 2020). Other indicators are the fatality rate (fatality rate), which is the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the infection rate (infection rate), which is the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Several scientists have attempted to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall infection rate for the pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The highest value of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study analysing the impact of the tests on estimates of lethality.
WHO maintains that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the epidemic are uncertain and may vary by region.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University said: "Without control, infectious epidemics usually stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease runs out of available hosts.
But it is almost impossible to make any relevant predictions at the moment about when this will happen. "
The Chief Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government Zhong Nanshan said that "this could be completed by June" if all countries manage to mobilize to follow WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will continue to circulate, potentially for a year or two."
According to an Imperial College study conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required "until a vaccine is available (possibly in 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said: "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus - because it is very easily transmitted - will disappear completely" and that it "could become a seasonal disease, likely to reappear every year."
The virulence of this return would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 are sometimes quite non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretions (mucosities), loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysia, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO states that about one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulty, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficult awakening, and bluish face or lips; immediate medical care is recommended if these symptoms are present. Subsequent progression of the disease may result in severe pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected individuals may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results that confirm the infection, so researchers have made recommendations that those who have had close contact with confirmed infected individuals should be closely monitored and examined to rule out the risk of infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is more often five days. A good example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of COVID-19 carriers who lost their odour was initially 30% before dropping to 15%.
Some information on how the disease spreads remains to be determined.
The disease is supposed to be transmitted mainly during close contact and by fine droplets produced by coughing, sneezing, or speaking; this close contact corresponds to a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet) to 8.2 metres (27 feet).
Some suggested that the virus could also be transmitted by fine droplets that would remain in the air for longer periods of time, which could be projected by talking. Respiratory droplets may also be projected at the time of expiration, including by talking, although the virus is generally not airborne.
Postillons can land in the mouth or nose of other people next door or even be inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions that are sprayed and therefore result in aerial propagation.
It can also spread when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, before touching his eyes, nose, or mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted through the stools, this risk is considered to be low.
The government of China has ruled out the possibility of fecooral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious for the first three days after the onset of symptoms, however the spread may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of the disease.
People were tested positive for the disease up to three days prior to onset of symptoms suggesting that transmission is possible prior to the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by some countries during contact search investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Precisely, the virus was detected after three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, after one day on cardboard, and after four hours on copper.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Pets and other animals have been tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, however the UK authorities recommend washing their hands after touching animals, as after having been in contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated from three pneumonia patients associated with the outbreak of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the wild-related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think he's zoonotic.
Genetic analysis revealed that coronavirus belongs genetically to the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) associated with two bats strains.
It is 96% identical to the entire genome of another sample of bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in some parts of the genome sequences between pangolin and human-derived viruses.
A comparison of the genome as a whole has so far revealed a maximum of 92% common genetic material between pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, however, final confirmation is done by reverse transcription of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected or scanner secretions.
A study comparing PCR and scanner to Wuhan suggested that the scanner is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, as many of its imaging features coincide with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that "the scanner should not be used to screen or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19."
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with an initial release on 17 January.
The test uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be carried out on respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually performed on a nasopharynx sample, but a throat sample can also be used. Several laboratories and companies are currently developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them proved reliable enough to be approved for widespread use.
In the United States, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic imaging elements on X-rays and CT scans (CT scans) of people with symptoms include asymmetric peripheral depolished glass opacity and a lack of pleural effusion.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently establishing an international online database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR-free imaging is of limited precision to detect COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest scanners to PCR and showed that if imaging is less accurate for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, advocating its inclusion as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based networks of convolutive neurons have been developed to detect virus characteristics in imaging on both X-rays and scanners.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include overall good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in a handkerchief and then throwing the handkerchief directly into a garbage bag.
It was recommended that those who were previously infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures have also been recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have banned or discouraged all non-essential movements to or from countries and sectors affected by the epidemic.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community transmission in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading to communities, and some members of these communities do not know where or how they have been infected. Health professionals who care for someone who may be infected are advised to take the usual precautions and contact precautions, and wear protective goggles. Finding contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments in this regard has raised confidentiality concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a press release calling for limitations on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications were launched or offered on a voluntary basis, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to record the presence of a user near other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested positive at COVID-19. False ideas are currently circulating on how to prevent infection; for example, rinsing their nose and gargling with mouthwash is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently working to develop one.
It is advisable to wash your hands to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands often with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after they have been in the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having faked, coughed, or sneezed.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope.
The CDC also recommended the use of an alcohol-based hand disinfectant containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not easily accessible.
WHO advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated in several ways (within one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5% iodinated povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an office building or nursery, all rooms such as offices, toilets, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls, and vending machines used by sick persons should be disinfected.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and to discard all handkerchiefs immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who are infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance travelled by the projected postillons while speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO has issued instructions explaining where and when to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of proper hand hygiene." The use of masks has also been advocated for those caring for someone potentially affected by the disease.
WHO recommended wearing masks to healthy people only if they face a significant risk, for example if they are caring for a patient with COVID-19, although it recognizes that wearing masks can help people not to touch their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage their people to use masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical tissue masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks for healthy people, especially when close (1 metre (3 feet) or less) to others.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask in public transport or crowded areas.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage people to make face masks at home and clean them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned public outings without masks or other means of covering his nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam imposed the mask on everyone in public places, so that everyone could protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered anyone entering a supermarket to wear a mask.
Israel asked all its residents to wear a mask in public.
Taiwan, which has produced 10 million masks a day since mid-March, imposed the wearing of the mask on long distance train and bus passengers on April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a mask for any exit, while recommending the manufacture of a handmade mask to those who cannot buy it.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes infection control measures designed to slow down the spread of the disease by reducing contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping malls.
One can apply the methods of social distancing by staying at home, limiting one's travels, avoiding crowds, greeting one another without contact and keeping a physical distance from others.
Many governments are now ordering or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the epidemic.
The maximum size of gatherings recommended by U.S. government and health agencies was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying health problems such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension or a weakened immune system were at increased risk of serious illness and complications. They were invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in areas affected by the epidemic. By the end of March 2020, WHO and other health care agencies began to replace the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing," to clarify the goal of reducing physical contact by preserving social ties, whether virtual or by keeping a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" suggested the need for total social isolation, rather than encouraging people to keep in touch with others through other means. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health during the pandemic.
They include the recommendation to have sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or does not have the symptoms.
Home isolation was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those who believe they are infected.
Health care agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper isolation. Many governments have imposed or recommended individual quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent individual quarantine instructions were given to those in the most at-risk groups.
Individuals who have been exposed to a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently travelled to a country or region where transmission is very high were invited to quarantine for 14 days from the time they were last exposed.
Outbreak control strategies are containment or suppression, and mitigation.
The containment is implemented during the early stages of the epidemic and is aimed at monitoring and isolating infected persons, as well as introducing other infection control and vaccination measures to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the spread of the disease, efforts are directed towards the mitigation phase: measures are taken to slow the spread of the disease and mitigate its effects on the health care system and society.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken at the same time.
Removal requires more extreme measures, in order to change the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of the management of an infectious disease epidemic is to try to mitigate the epidemic peak: this is what is called flattering the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and saves time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can manage the epidemic include personal prevention measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing masks and individual quarantine; public social dislocation measures, such as the closure of schools and religious services; a public effort to encourage acceptance of and participation in such interventions; and environmental actions, such as cleaning surfaces. More drastic measures to curb the epidemic have been taken in China once the severity of the epidemic has become apparent, such as quarantining of entire cities and a strict travel ban.
Other countries have also adopted a variety of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantine, and issued alerts on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have quarantined, and has imposed heavy fines on those who have not.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and sanctioned the grabbing of medical supplies. Simulations for Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not eliminating the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (reversing the development of the epidemic) face significant challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies can reduce health care demand by 2 / 3 and deaths by half, but cannot prevent hundreds of thousands of deaths, and health care systems are overwhelmed.
Suppression may be preferred, but must be continued as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this occurs first), because otherwise, the transmission resumes rapidly when the measurements are released.
The long-term response to the pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no approved antiviral treatments for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including existing treatment tests.
Taking non-prescription cold or drink medications and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous infusions and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids may worsen the results.
Several compounds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently being studied for the treatment of COVID-19.
The WHO stated that some "traditional and artisanal remedies" can soften the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
The increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of patients with COVID-19 is described by WHO as a fundamental response to the epidemic.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redeployment of resources at different levels, including by devoting laboratory services to COVID-19 tests, cancelling non-urgent interventions where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and strengthening intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of fans and beds available.
There are various theories concerning the place of origin of the very first case (called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus could date back to December 1, 2019, in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
In a month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei has gradually increased.
They are generally linked to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, which also sold live animals. According to one theory, the virus came from one of these animals; in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. An outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause was observed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Province Hospital, which informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues of a "SARS-like coronavirus."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission subsequently issued a public notice on 31 December and informed WHO.
There were enough cases of unknown pneumonia reported to the Wuhan health authorities to trigger an investigation in early January. In the early stages of the epidemic, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, assisted by Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major rail connecting point.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms on January 20, 2020. On March 26, the United States surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. On April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; over 97,000 people died and over 364,000 cured.
About 200 countries and territories had at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have restricted movement and introduced border controls.
National responses included containment measures such as quarantining (also referred to as home, shelter or containment orders) and curfews. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, are confined in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1.3 billion in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of containment, with 2.6 billion two days later - about a third of the world's population.
The origin of the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was dated 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report suggests that the first confirmed case dates back to 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause on 26 December and informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
The WHO was informed on the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan received a warning for "spreading rumors" about the epidemic.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping as a "people's war" to stem the spread of the virus.
In what has been described as "the largest quarantine in human history," a sanitary cord was announced on 23 January to stop travel from and to Wuhan, which has been extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting a total of about 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles has been banned in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital was later built: Leishenshan, to treat additional patients.
In addition to the new hospitals, China converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention and stadium centres, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the government introduced new measures to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, including the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of Spring Day holidays.
The country & apos; s universities and schools have also been closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have instituted several measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote working measures have been introduced in several regions of China.
Travel restrictions have been adopted in Hubei and beyond.
Public transport has been changed and museums in China have been temporarily closed.
Population displacement control has been applied in many cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (more than half of the population) have experienced some form of displacement restriction. After the epidemic entered a global phase in March, the Chinese authorities have taken strict measures to prevent the virus from being "imported" from other countries.
For example, Beijing imposed a 14-day quarantine for all international travellers entering the city. As of March 23, in mainland China, only one case had been transmitted inside the country in the previous five days, in this case via a traveller returning to Canton from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Prime Minister Li Keqiang stated that the spread of cases transmitted within the country has been largely blocked, and that the epidemic has been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were relaxed in Hubei, apart from Wuhan, two months after confinement began. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on March 26, 2020 that entry for visa or residence permit holders would be suspended from March 28, without specifying when this policy would end.
Persons wishing to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30, and granted monetary stimulus plans to businesses. The State Business Council announced a day of mourning to begin with three minutes of silence on April 4 at 10: 00 a.m., coinciding with the Qingming Feast, although the central government asked families to pay tribute online to respect physical distance and avoid a renewal of the COVID-19 epidemic.
It has been confirmed that the COVID-19 spread to South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
The nation's health agency reported a considerable increase in confirmed cases on February 20, largely attributed to a gathering in Daegu of a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji's faithful who visited Daegu from Wuhan were suspected of having caused the epidemic.
On February 22, 1,261 or about 13% of the church's 9,336 faithful reported symptoms. South Korea announced the highest level of alert on February 23, 2020.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, followed by 3,150 on 29 February.
All military bases in South Korea were quarantined after three soldiers were tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also met and thus changed. South Korea introduced what was considered the largest and best organized program in the world to test the population with the virus, isolate all infected people, and track and quarantine those who have been in contact with them.
Screening methods included mandatory individual reporting of symptoms by international newcomers via a mobile application, virus screening drives delivering the results the following day, and increased testing capacity to test nearly 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is seen as a success story in controlling the epidemic, although it did not quarantine entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for mismanagement of the epidemic by the government or, on the contrary, praising his response.
On 23 March, South Korea experienced the lowest number of daily cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was announced that from 1 April, all persons arriving from abroad would be quarantined for two weeks.

Shia shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became a centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
On the basis of allegations of possible concealment of the extent of the epidemic in Iran, more than ten countries had located the origin of their cases in Iran on 28 February, suggesting that the epidemic was perhaps more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government at that time.
The Iranian parliament was closed, while 23 of its 290 members reported having been tested positive for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the prison authorities to release unconditionally human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to temporarily release all prisoners meeting certain conditions.

On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the largest total recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
At least 12 former and current Iranian politicians and government members had died of the disease on 17 March.
On March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO representative, there might be five times as many cases in Iran as the number reported.
It is also suggested that United States sanctions may affect the country's financial capacity to respond to the epidemic.
The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has called for the easing of economic sanctions for the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
It was confirmed that the epidemic had spread to Italy on 31 January, when two Chinese tourists were tested positive at SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
A hotbed of unrelated cases of COVID-19 was later detected, with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the epidemic, including quarantining more than 50,000 people in 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "In areas affected by the epidemic, no entry or exit will be allowed.
The suspension of professional activity and sporting events has already been ordered in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of all schools and universities in the country while Italy had 100 deaths.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football games, were scheduled to be held in camera until April, but on March 9, the entire sport was suspended for a minimum of one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the cessation of almost all commercial activity, with the exception of supermarkets and pharmacies.

As of 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cures; the majority of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of the large elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all people with the virus to date may have contributed to the high mortality rate.
The UK response to the virus first appeared to be one of the most flexible among the affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK government did not impose any form of social distancing or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the government was criticized for its apparent lack of responsiveness and vivacity in response to public concerns. On March 16, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement, advising against all non-essential travel and social contacts, suggesting that people work from home if possible and avoid places such as pubs, restaurants and entertainment venues.
On 20 March, the government announced that all recreational facilities such as pubs and sports halls should close as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages, up to a limit of £2,500 per month, in order to avoid unemployment linked to the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced tougher social distancing measures, prohibiting gatherings of more than two people and limiting travel and outdoor activities to the strictly necessary.
Contrary to previous measures, these restrictions were subject to police sanctions, including fines and the dispersal of gatherings.
Most businesses have been ordered to close, with the exception of those deemed "essential," such as supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, DIY stores, gas stations and garages.

Despite this, the United States took time to start testing, which obscured the true extent of the epidemic at that time.
The tests were tainted by defective testing kits produced by the federal government in February, the lack of federal approval for non-governmental testing kits (universities, businesses and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for eligibility for testing until early March (a mandatory doctor's prescription thereafter).
On February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.
On March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.

In March, China, Cuba and Russia sent medical equipment and experts to help Italy cope with the coronavirus epidemic.
Business man Jack Ma sent 1.1 million screening kits, 6 million protective masks and 60,000 protective suits to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, for distribution by the African Union.
He subsequently sent 5,000 screening kits, 100,000 protective masks and 5 respirators to Panama.
Ma also donated medical equipment to Canada. The Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Georgia and the Czech Republic expressed concern about masks and testing kits manufactured in China.
For example, Spain removed 58,000 coronavirus screening kits manufactured in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks; they were thought to have come from China, but they actually came from Colombia.
On the other hand, Chinese aid was well received in the regions of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak of 2002-2004, where Chinese authorities had been accused of concealment that had hampered prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis in which the central government "provided regular reports to avoid panic on the eve of the lunar New Year."
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to apply a travel ban in Wuhan, the WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that although this was "certainly not a WHO recommendation," it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated," and he referred to a fact "unprecedented in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of inter-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, the WHO stated that the epidemic was an international public health emergency (USPPI), the sixth USPPI since the measure was invoked during the 2009 influenza A pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that the USPPI was due to "the risk of global spread, especially for low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the application of travel restrictions, Tedros stated: "there is no reason for measures to interfere unnecessarily with international travel and trade" and "WHO does not recommend restricting trade and travel."
On 5 February, WHO called on the international community to contribute $675 million for strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgent need to support those countries that "do not have the systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it is about to appear."
Tedros then said that we were "as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more tomorrow." On February 11, WHO established in a press conference that the disease was called COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros stated that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to integrate the "strength of the entire United Nations system into the response."
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated to coordinate the entire United Nations response, which, according to WHO, will enable them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can provide expertise to manage the broader social, economic and development implications of the epidemic."
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team was activated in China to send international and WHO experts to China to support national management and to assess "the severity and transmission of the disease" by organizing workshops and meetings with key national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities at the provincial and county levels, including in urban and rural areas." On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic," indicating that although it is too early to talk about a pandemic, each country should nevertheless enter "in the preparatory phase."
In response to the spread of the epidemic in Iran, WHO sent a joint mission team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO representatives stated that the global threat assessment for coronavirus had gone from "high" to "very high," its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Management Program, warned in a statement: "This is a return to reality for every government in the world: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and you need to be ready, "adding that the right response measures could help the world avoid" the worst. "
Ryan then said that the current data did not allow public health officials to announce a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we accept in absolute terms that every human on the planet is exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, the WHO stated that the coronavirus epidemic could be described as a pandemic.
The Director General said that WHO was "extremely concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming levels of inaction." WHO faced significant criticism of its management of the pandemic, which was considered inadequate, including the late reporting of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
This negative reaction was supported by a petition urging WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom to resign, signed by 733,000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts focused on respecting the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts stated that everyone was entitled to relief interventions and that this responsibility lay with the Government.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for any discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that every individual has the right to health, including persons with disabilities, belonging to minorities, the elderly, internally displaced persons, the homeless, those living in extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are responsible for the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform that provides timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in different countries of the world, as well as views and advice.
Between policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy and responses to the effects of containment and travel restrictions, the digital platform includes a Country Policy Tracker tool to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, the British cabinet minister Michael Gove and the son of Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several provincial administrators of the Communist Party of China (CCP) were relieved of their duties as a result of their quarantine management in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the response of politicians to the epidemic in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the secretary general of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from popular anger about the coronavirus epidemic.
Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected the initial idea that the coronavirus epidemic had begun in Wuhan in favour of conspiracy theories that COVID-19 would have its origins in the United States or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus," stating that in China "censorship has increased a virus that has become a global pandemic," which was later dubbed racism by some opponents and intended to "divert attention from its administration's inability to contain the disease."
The Daily Beast has obtained a telegram from the US government outlining a communications strategy that appears to have emerged from the National Security Council, whose strategy is as follows: "Everything comes from China.
We are being asked to try to convey this message in every possible way, including through press conferences and television appearances. "Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda drive to gain global influence.
EU Head of Foreign Policy Josep Borrell warned that there was "a geopolitical component involving a struggle for influence through rhetoric and" policy of generosity. "
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively insisting that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called on the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while sending aid a priori to those two countries.
The 100,000 masks given by Jack Ma to Cuba were blocked by American sanctions on 3 April.
The US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid to other nations to their own countries.
And other conflicts related to masks have also been reported among other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity between the European Union and Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that "only China replied bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign for European solidarity. "
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-ranking political source" that indicated that 80 percent of Russian aid was "little if any useful for Italy."
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive of "geopolitical and diplomatic charm."
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denied the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov said that "by offering his help to his American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and equipment gain speed, they will be able to return the same to them if necessary."
The scope of NATO's "Defender 2020" military exercise planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO manoeuvre since the end of the Cold War, will be reduced.
The Secretary General of the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign Kate Hudson criticized Exercise Defender 2020: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers not only the lives of American troops and many participating European countries, but also the lives of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about 20 members of parliament infected, as well as 15 other former or current political figures.
Iran's President Hassan Rohani wrote an open letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was struggling to combat the epidemic because of the lack of access to international markets due to the US sanctions against Iran. The epidemic has elicited calls for the US to adopt social policies common to other rich countries, including a universal health care system, a universal childcare programme, paid parental leave and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts expect this to negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated as a result of the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that anyone arriving from South Korea would be placed in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially divided about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon to be indicted for the government's mismanagement of the epidemic or to praise its response. The pandemic has enabled countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could enable Governments to strengthen their power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree until further notice, suspend parliament and elections and punish anyone accused of spreading false information about the virus and the government's management of the crisis.
The coronavirus epidemic has been accused of several cases of supply disruptions, resulting from a global increase in the use of equipment to combat the epidemic, panic purchases and disruption of plant operations and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Agency has issued warnings regarding shortages of drugs and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and disruption of suppliers.
Several communities have also faced panic purchases that have resulted in the disappearance of basic necessities, such as food, toilet paper and water bottles, and rays, leading to shortages.
The technology sector, in particular, has alerted to delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100-fold.
This demand led to a price increase of up to 20 times the normal price and also resulted in delays in the provision of medical devices for a period of four to six months.
This has also led to a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warns that it will put health professionals at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for sugars to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the ensuing high demand for food, both areas were spared serious food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the storage and illegal trade of essential products were a real success, thus avoiding the serious food shortages that had been foreseen in Europe and North America.
As a result of its large agricultural output, Northern Italy did not see a significant decline, but prices could increase according to industry representatives.
Food spoils were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while members of the Chinese government released pork reserves to ensure adequate subsistence.
Similar laws exist in Italy to ensure that food producers store reserves for such emergencies.
Negative effects on the global economy have been felt in China: according to a media report of 16 March, the Chinese economy was hit very hard in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to limit the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral epidemic has emerged as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until a clearer picture emerged on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the impact of the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert from the Washington University of St. Louis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the global supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would have "scrambled" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to lower demand in China.
World stock markets fell on 24 February following a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, as a result of growing concern about the coronavirus epidemic, several U.S. stock market indices, including NASDAQ-100, S & amp; P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, posted their sharpest falls since 2008, with a Dow Jones dropping to 1,191 points, the largest drop in a day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three indices ended the week with a drop of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the rating of China's sovereign debt, but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again due to concerns about coronavirus, with the largest decrease recorded on March 16.
Many believe that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures put in place by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did in the financial collapse of 2008.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected by travel bans, the closure of public spaces, including tourist attractions, and government recommendations against travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
The impact on the cruise industry has reached an unprecedented level.
Several railway stations and ferry ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the Chinese New Year.
A number of events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year festivities, and private companies also closed independently their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many lunar New Year events were cancelled and many tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year holidays until February 10, requiring most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country & apos; s GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has moved to its highest level of response to infectious diseases and has declared an emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been impacted globally, with reductions in shop opening times or temporary closures.
Visits to traders in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
In North America and the Middle East, traders saw a 50-60% decline.
This also led to a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic in shopping malls in March compared to February.
Mall operators around the world have imposed additional measures, such as increased cleaning frequencies, the installation of thermal scanners to control customer temperature and the cancellation of events. According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession caused by the pandemic could leave an additional 14 to 22 million people living in extreme poverty in Latin America compared to a situation without a pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
In China, a large part of the approximately 300 million rural migrant workers were trapped in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied to the government for help.
The coronavirus epidemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Containment in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (receiving a daily wage) unemployed. The Angus Reid Institute survey found that 44% of Canadian households had experienced a certain type of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since confinement in mid-March 2020.
In the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit. Almost half a million German companies turned their employees to a partial activity scheme subsidized by the government called Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, impacting the functioning of organizations as well as individuals, both employed and self-employed, at the global level.
Arts and cultural organizations have attempted to maintain their mission (often state-funded) to provide access to cultural heritage to the community, ensure the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists to the extent possible.
In March 2020, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions were closed all over the world to varying degrees until further notice and their exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which took place in the last week of the Christian penance period of Lent, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay at home rather than attend Sunday Mass; some churches broadcast their religious services on radio, online and live or on television, while others offer to practice their worship as a "drive-in."
Like the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome, which closed its churches and chapels, and St. Peter's Square, which emptied itself of all its Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Minister of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the epidemic and the holy places were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their inhabitants to the sacred sites of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the largest interruption in the world sports calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sporting events were either cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA 2019-20 Champions League, the English Football Championship 2019-20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the NHL 2019-20 season.
The outbreak disrupted the organization of the 2020 Summer Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "replanned beyond 2020, but no later than summer 2021." Casinos and other gaming establishments around the world closed and live poker tournaments were either postponed or cancelled.
This has prompted many players to register online, and many online gaming sites have seen a significant increase in their number of new registrations. The world of the show has also been hit, with several music bands having suspended or cancelled their concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, have also interrupted all their performances.
Some artists have sought ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet as a substitute for traditional live performances, such as live and online concerts or online "festivals" created for artists to perform, broadcast and promote their works.
Online, many Internet memes on the topic of coronavirus have spread as many prefer humour and distraction in the face of uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemic, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese and East Asian origin, and against people from sensitive areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (while the majority of cases were still limited to China) described racist feelings expressed in different groups around the world that the Chinese deserved the virus or received a justified punishment.
Some African countries have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
Support was provided to Chinese people, whether online or offline, and to people living in areas affected by the virus.
As a result of the spread of the epidemic to new and sensitive countries, Italians from Europe's first country to experience a severe COVID-19 epidemic could also face suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to ban Chinese entry to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag # ChineseDontComeToJapan was furious on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States reported an increase in levels of racist insults, as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump faced criticism for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus," a term considered by his critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protesters attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreign evacuees between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, which shares a border with China, and studying in large Indian cities, have reportedly been harassed in connection with the coronavirus epidemic.
The chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party's West Bengal unit Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God took revenge on them."
The remarks were later condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, who described them as "false." In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were fuelled by the pandemic, with foreigners being described as "foreign waste" that should be "eliminated."
Many paid-access newspapers removed them for all or part of their coverage on the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles available in connection with the open-access epidemic.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results quickly on pre-publication servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory screening for the 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for the detection of the virus and for the detection of antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects coronavirus RNA.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including those with symptoms that were too mild to report or asymptomatic.
An exact mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity among the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited screening, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population by March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were significant differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to significantly affect reported lethality rates, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using reverse transcription followed by a real-time chain polymerization reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained using a variety of methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum sample.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test from pharyngeal swabs is reliable only during the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested during the second week, a sample may also be taken from the deep respiratory tract by suction catheter, or a spit (sputum) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed by Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using a reverse transcription followed by a real-time polymerization chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and was the basis for 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom had also developed a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It detects the "E" gene shared by all beta-coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV-2-specific RdRp gene. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency authorization from the Chinese National Medical Products Administration for a PCR- based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes their diagnostic device by RT-PCR in real time from the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
Among the older versions of the test kits, one genetic test out of three obtained inconclusive results due to defective reagents, as well as a testing bottleneck at the Atlanta CDC. As a result, an average of less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was only then that federal and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorization. United States commercial laboratories began testing early in March 2020.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp has announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 tests.
Quest Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests nationally on March 9, 2020.
No quantitative limitations have been announced. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR National Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Surveillance Service. On March 12, 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed a COVID-19.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in large quantities in 3.5 hours, allowing an aircraft to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA granted an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system. The FDA had previously granted a similar authorization to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received an USA from the FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott plans to scale up manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to the nucleocapside protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is under development in Taiwan, in the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes, such as a rapid influenza test.
A March 2020 literature study concluded that "pulmonary radiographs have a low diagnostic value in the early stages, while TDM [computed tomography] results can be conclusive even before symptoms appear."
Typical symptoms visible on TDM include multi-lobar bilateral depolite glass opacity with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution.
A subpleural predominance, a "crazy paving" and a consolidation develop as the disease evolves.
A study comparing PCR to TDM at Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less accurate, with several of its imaging results coinciding with other pneumonia and diseases.
In March 2020, the U.S. College of Radiology recommended that "TDM not be used for screening or as a front-line test to diagnose COVID-19." In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for initial screening.
The production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG, is part of the immune response to infection.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and as part of population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (TLC) or by patient bedside testing (point-of-care testing, PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in many clinical laboratories are capable of performing these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, only one peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial samples can be used to track the immune response.
For PoCT, only one blood sample is usually taken by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, no extraction steps are required prior to the analysis. On March 26, 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that have duly informed the Agency and which, therefore, can now distribute their antibody testing.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorization. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The screening capacity is several hundred samples in a few hours, which is much faster than the PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies are generally detectable 14 days after the start of the infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits purchased by the country performed well enough to be used.
Hong Kong has put in place a plan whereby suspicious cases can stay at home, "the emergency department will provide the patient with a sample tube," patients spit inside, return it and receive the test result later. The UK NHS announced that it is conducting a pilot project to test suspicious cases at home, eliminating the risk that a patient will infect others by going to a hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance in case of use. As part of the COVID-19 test drive for suspicious cases, a health professional will take a sample with appropriate precautions.
The "drive" centres enabled South Korea to perform one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world. In Germany, the National Association of Physicians of Compulsory Health Insurance declared on March 2 that it had the capacity to perform some 12,000 tests a day in outpatient settings, and that 10,700 patients had been tested in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of March 19, driver tests were available in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results are reported.
A first laboratory study revealed that, during the 12 / 2020 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including 12 / 2020, and that 33,491 samples (6.9%) obtained a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of analyzing samples from 64 patients at a time, by collecting samples and only screening if the combined sample proves to be positive.In Wuhan, an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2,000 square metres, known as "Huo-Yan," and can process more than 10,000 samples per day (in Chinese), i.e. "Fire Eye" in French) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, and can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
Through its 5-day construction supervised by Wang Jian, the founder of BGI, modelling revealed that cases in Hubei province would have been 47% higher and that the quarantine cost would have doubled without this screening capability.
The Wuhan laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 Chinese cities.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity was 50,000 tests per day.Multiplexed free models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be performed in small laboratories without a liquid manipulator robot.
In March, shortages and insufficient quantities of reagents became a bottleneck for mass screening in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to examine sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 ° C (208 ° F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes to continue screening. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now the country testing most of its population per capita for Coronavirus, and was in the process of intensifying screening to reach the majority of the population.
These results were achieved through a combination of driver-test capability and the purchase of a population-wide high-speed laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on their Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first laboratory of this ability to be operational outside China.
Various test formulas targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German formula for making kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on January 17, 2020. The protocol developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was only published on January 28, delaying the availability of tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidemic, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts indicate that the high availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the spread of the new coronavirus.
Screening capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been strengthened over several years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended intensified screening programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests being delayed in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of swabs and chemical reagents has been depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC were "flawed." The government then removed bureaucratic barriers to private testing. Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were unreliable.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be related to the inability to collect samples or use the kits correctly.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it will remove the wrong test kits, and replace them with another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits purchased from China by the Czech Republic provided false results. Slovakia purchased from China 1.2 million test kits that proved to be defective.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested to throw them in the Danube. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and that it did not "use them." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but announced in early April 2020 that they were unusable.
Screening, followed by the quarantine of those who achieved a positive result and tracing of those who had been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 carriers, yielded positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place of the first COVID-19-related death in Italy, carried out two series of tests on the entire population of about 3,400 people, about ten days apart.
Almost half of those with positive results did not show symptoms, and all cases found were quarantined.
With the restriction of movement in the municipality, this measure has completely eliminated new infections.
Through aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, Singapore's 2020 coronavirus pandemic has progressed much faster than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail outlets.
Many events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened as scheduled at the end of the holidays on March 23.
Several other countries also managed the pandemic through aggressive contact tracing, restrictions on incoming travel, screening and quarantine, but with less aggressive containment, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with the most tests, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower lethality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect people with mild symptoms or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries with no analytical capacity and limited COVID-19 experience in national laboratories send their first five positive and ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive in% tests" depends on the national screening policy.
A country that only tests those admitted to hospital will have a positive value in% of tests higher than a country that tests all citizens, whether or not they have symptoms, the other factors being the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the cleaning of hands to remove dirt, grease, microorganisms or other undesirable substances.
The systematic washing of hands with soap at certain "key moments" of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the faecal route.
Respiratory diseases such as influenza or cold can be contracted, for example, by failing to wash your hands before touching your eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day: before and after the defecation, after cleaning a baby's buttocks or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
If you have no soap or water under your hand, you can wash your hands with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends that you wash your hands:
before, during and after meal preparation;
before and after caring for a sick person;
after changing the diapers of a baby or cleaning a child who has gone to the toilet;
after faking or coughing / sneezing;
after touching an animal, animal feed or animal waste;
Hand hygiene in medical settings refers to health practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medication or providing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical objective of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that may cause disease) and chemicals, which may be harmful or cause disease.
This practice is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but also for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections;
as well as a reduction in the infant mortality rate during home deliveries.
According to a 2013 study, improved hand hygiene practices could lead to a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhoea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioural changes, such as hand-washing with soap.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate associated with these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
The introduction of measures to promote hand washing could reduce diarrhea by about one third, a figure comparable to that obtained by supplying drinking water to low-income areas.
Washing hands with soap reduces diarrhea by 48% and is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). This must be done automatically in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the leading ARIs, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, with nearly 1.8 million deaths per year.
Together, diarrhoea and pneumonia cause the deaths of nearly 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, taking the habit of washing hands with soap before eating and after going to the toilet can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce diarrhea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually associated with other sanitary measures in the context of the WASH programmes.
Hand washing also protects from impetigo, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A minor deleterious effect, frequent hand washing can damage the skin by causing skin drying.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing could lead to eczema or dermatitis in the hands, characterized by scaly skin and itching, and particularly common in health care workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
It is important to wash your hands with soap at five key moments of the day to reduce the faecal-oral transmission of diseases: before and after using the toilet (urination, defecation), after cleaning a baby's buttocks (or changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
It is also necessary to wash your hands properly to prevent the transmission of diseases, especially before and after treating a cut or injury, after sneezing, coughing or foaming, after touching animal waste or handling animals and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the rate of hand-to-hand soap cleaning is low.
According to a 2015 hand hygiene survey of 54 countries, an average of 38.7 per cent of households washed their hands with soap. A 2014 study showed that the highest rate was in Saudi Arabia (97 per cent), the United States was in the middle of the picture (77 per cent), and China had the lowest rate (23 per cent). Today, there are several methods to change behaviour and democratize the use of hand washing soap at key times of the day. In particular, it is possible, in developing countries, to offer schoolchildren to wash their hands in groups at specific times of the day in order for children to do this act.
For example, the Filipinne Ministry of Education has implemented a "Primary Health Care Program" to promote child health and education.
Deworming twice a year, combined with daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing of teeth with fluorinated toothpaste, is at the heart of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Soaps or detergents should be added to water to better remove microorganisms on the skin.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce obstacles to the solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is not an effective cleansing agent for the skin as lipids and proteins, which are organic materials in the soil, are difficult to soluble in water.
However, adequate water flow facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, because of its reusable nature, can contain bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that the transfer was unlikely because the bacteria were rinsed with foam.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) nevertheless states that "vending machines for liquid soap are preferable."
Antibacterial soaps have been highly recommended for those who are concerned about their health.
To date, there is no evidence to suggest that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants can target antibiotic-resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, to which many strains of organisms resist.
Therefore, even if antibiotic resistant strains are not the fruit of antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as announced.
In addition to the surfactant and protective agent of the skin, the most complex formulations may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) used to regulate pH, benzoic acid, having an antimicrobial function, and other protective agents (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts) .A rigorous analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that ordinary soaps were as effective as antibacterial soaps intended for individuals and containing triclosan, to prevent disease and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
The hot water used to wash your hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria multiply much faster at body temperature (37 ° C).
However, warm and soapy water is more effective than cold and soapy water in removing natural oils that carry dirt and bacteria.
But contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of lukewarm water does not help to reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non-aqueous hand hygiene product.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-based non-aqueous hand hygiene products (commonly referred to as hydroalcoholic solutions, hand antiseptic solutions or hand disinfectants) began to become popular.
Most are formulated using isopropyl alcohol or ethanol combined with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to obtain a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to obtain a liquid or foam for greater ease of use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of diluted hydrogen peroxide enhances antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing at least 60-95% alcohol effectively eliminate germs.
Hydroalcohol solutions kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis and certain viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis), as well as fungi.
Hydroalcohol solutions containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (3.5 reduction, log equivalent to 35 decibels reduction) of the bacteria present on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 log reduction) of the bacteria present on the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against certain viruses.
Hydroalcoholic solutions are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the main cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient hand disinfectant or hydroalcoholic solution should be used to wet or cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands and the interstices between the fingers and nails should be faded for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, foam or gel dries.
It is also necessary to clean the ends of your fingers by rubbing them, palm to palm. The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing rather than the use of hydroalcoholic solutions, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these products is due to their ease of use and rapid removal of microorganisms; however, they should not replace proper hand washing unless you have no water and soap at hand.
Frequent use of hydroalcoholic solutions may result in dry skin if the formula is not reinforced by emollients and / or moisturizing agents of the skin.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and / or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hydroalcohol solutions containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than antimicrobial soaps or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria, or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in hydroalcoholic solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcoholic solutions are less likely to cause irritating contact dermatitis has made them more attractive than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aqueous products do not remove organic matter from the hands, but only disinfect it.
This is why hand disinfectants are not as effective as soap and water to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as they remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand disinfectants is highly dependent on ingredients and formula, and has always been significantly lower than alcohol and alcohol-based disinfectants.
More recently, formulae that use benzalkonium chloride have shown long-lasting and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which is less effective after repeated use, probably due to progressive skin adverse reactions.
Among low-income populations, many do not have the means to buy soap, but rather use ash or soil.
Ash or earth can be more effective than water alone, but less efficient than soap.
Moreover, if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease rather than stop it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
The WHO recommends ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The American Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends proper hand washing to prevent disease transmission, following the following steps:
Wet hands with warm or cold running water.
Running water is recommended because of the risk of contamination of stagnant water points, while water temperature does not appear to make a difference).
Mousse a generous amount of soap on the hands by rubbing them against each other, not forgetting the back of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap than with water alone.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The action of rubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and rubbing longer removes more germs.
Rinse thoroughly with running water.
Rinse in a stagnant water pool can lead to recontamination of the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or open air.
Wet and wet hands recontaminate more easily. The most often forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the spaces between the fingers and the bottom of the nails.
Artificial nails and chipped nail polish can accommodate microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to avoid dry hands; dry skin causes skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many cost-effective alternatives to wash hands when tap water and / or soap are not available. For example, sprinkle water from a suspended and drilled can or gourd and / or use ash if needed in developing countries.In situations where water supply is limited (such as in schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as tippy-taps and other economic options.
A tippy-tap is a simple technology that uses a jug suspended with a rope, and a pedal to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a soap loaf.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to dry hands in public toilets is a debate.
Increasingly, research suggests that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers that are often found in toilets.
In 2008, a study funded by the paper towel industry, the European Tissue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, to compare the hygiene levels offered by more modern paper towels, hot air hand dryers and jet air dryers.
After washing and drying the hands in the hot air hand-dryer, it was found that the total number of bacteria increased on average by 194% on the finger pulp and 254% on the palms.
Air-jet hand dryer drying resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the finger pulp by 42% and on the palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria was reduced by an average of 76% on the finger pulp and up to 77% on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a potential for cross-contamination with other toilet users and the toilet environment depending on each drying method.
The air jet hand dryer, which blows air out of the aircraft at announced speeds of 180 m / s (650 km / h; 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hands and the aircraft and possibly contaminating other toilet users as well as the toilet environment within a perimeter of up to 2 metres.
The use of a hot air hand dryer allows micro-organisms to be diffused at a maximum distance of 0.25 metres from the hand dryer.
Paper towels revealed that there was no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
After hand drying, the following changes in bacterial count were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and the hand dryers were compared to the drying using paper towels.
Hand washing with disinfectant wipes is an alternative solution during movement, in the absence of soap and water.
Hydroalcohol solutions must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing in a medical setting became compulsory long after the Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered his effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent illness in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that issue reminders when hospital staff forget to wash their hands.
One study found that their use resulted in a decrease in infection rates.
Medical hand washing should last at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed against each other by passing between the fingers.
In case of residues under the nails, a hairbrush can be used to remove them.
Since the germs present in the water are likely to remain on the hands, it is important to rinse well and wipe with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the tap (and open the exit door if necessary).
This helps to avoid re-contaminating the hands in contact with the surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in health care facilities is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, with many doctors and nurses regularly forgetting to wash their hands before touching their patients, which encourages the transmission of microorganisms.
According to one study, washing hands properly and following other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related blood infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a brochure describing the standard procedure for washing and rubbing hands in the health field.
The draft guidelines on hand hygiene prepared by the Organization are also available on the web site for feedback from Internet users.
A relevant analysis was conducted by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and certify hand hygiene, if compliance with regulations is proven.
The World Health Organization defines "Five indications" for hand hygiene:
after exposure to blood / biological fluid;
before an aseptic gesture; and
After contact with the patient. Adding antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "antimicrobial" soaps) provides the hand washing agent with germ destruction.
It is desirable to remove these germs before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are widespread. To "rub" your hands for surgery, it is necessary to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching your hands, a chlorhexidine or iodine-based washing product, sterile towels to dry your hands after washing them, a sterile brush to rub and another sterile instrument to clean under your nails.
All jewellery must be removed.
As part of this procedure, it is necessary to wash your hands and forearms to the elbow, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to rub your hands for 10 minutes.
When rinsing, the water on the forearms should not flow to the hands.
Once your hands are washed, you should dry your hands with a sterile cloth and put on a surgical casaque.
In order to reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
With regard to the control of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of hand washing were obtained during the first 20% of the washing, and that there were very few additional benefits to increase the frequency of hand washing beyond 35%.
Comparing hand washing with regular soap with antibacterial soap, the rate of bacterial infectious diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. Similarly, comparing hand cleaning with alcohol-based solution and hand washing with antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds each, the first reduces bacterial contamination by 26% compared to the second.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based products in reducing influenza A (H1N1) virus and difficult Clostridium spores on the hands. In order to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities, it is possible to train personnel in hand washing, make more alcohol-based products available to them and send them written and verbal reminders.
More research is needed to find out which interventions are most effective in different health structures.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered to be an inexpensive and essential tool to maintain health and even to feed properly.
However, the lack of reliable water points, soap or hand washing facilities at home, school and the workplace makes it difficult to achieve universal hand hygiene practices.
For example, in much of rural Africa, it is rare to find hand washing faucets close to private or public toilets, despite the existence of cost-effective options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be due to persistent habits, rather than a lack of soap or water.
Promoting and raising awareness of soap washing can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of soap washing and lead to long-term behavioural change among the population.
For this to succeed, monitoring and evaluation activities are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that local approaches are effective in increasing hand washing rates in low- and middle-income countries, and that social marketing campaigns are less effective. With regard to the promotion of hand washing in schools, one example is the UNICEF "Three Star Approach," which encourages schools to take simple and inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, while respecting other hygiene rules.
Once the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to three final stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the hand hygiene campaigns that are conducted to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
World Hand Washing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that aims to promote behavioural change. Following the coronavirus pandemic of 2019-2020, UNICEF has encouraged the adoption of an emoji illustrating hand washing.
Few studies have examined the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the number of healthy years of life earned (i.e. DALY avoided).
However, a review suggests that the promotion of hand washing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, especially for vulnerable people such as recently delivered mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first identified in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing."
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were due to fetid odours called miasms.
In the 1980s, food-borne epidemics and nosocomial infections led the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively promote hand hygiene as an essential means of preventing the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to increased awareness in many countries about the need to wash their hands with soap to protect themselves against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters illustrating "good hand washing techniques" were placed next to sinks in public toilets and in the washrooms of office buildings and airports.
The term "wash your hands" refers to a person's refusal to assume responsibility or to be an accomplice to something.
It is the result of a biblical verse of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but this expression has spread widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth undertook to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary spot, a symbol of her bad conscience in the light of the crimes she had committed and had incited her husband to commit.
It has also been found that some individuals, after remembering or considering unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others and to place more value on hand washing devices.
In addition, those who are allowed to wash their hands after having such thoughts are less likely to engage in other "purification" compensatory measures, such as volunteering.
Some religions prescribe hand washing for both hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, which consists of using water and not soap to wash hands, is one of the hand washing rituals promoted in many religions, including Baha'ism and Hinduism, immersion (tevilah) and ritual hand washing (Netilat Yadayim) in Judaism, washbasin in Christianity and wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe hand washing for hygienic purposes, especially after certain actions.
According to Hinduism, Judaism and Islam, it is compulsory to wash your hands after going to the toilet.
Likewise, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require washing hands before and after each meal.
Risk control of COVID-19 in the workplace
The risk control of COVID-19 in the workplace refers to the implementation of occupational health and safety methodologies for risk control for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls vary depending on the workplace and tasks, based on an assessment of the risks of exposure sources, the severity of the disease in the community, and individual risk factors for workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19 infection.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees. In this case, only basic prevention measures against infection are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory labelling, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Jobs at risk of medium exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact with persons without suspected or known COVID-19 but who may be infected due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers in contact with the general public, especially in schools, high-density work environments and some high-volume retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using highly effective air filters, hygienic windows and the provision of personal protective equipment in the event of encounters with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and funeral workers exposed to persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known to present a high risk of exposure, moving to a very high risk if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or take or manipulate samples of persons with a COVID-19 suspected or known.
Appropriate risk checks for these workers include technical checks such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent because they have become ill, have to take care of others, or fear possible exposure.
Commercial models may change, both in terms of the goods being requested and in terms of the means of acquiring them (such as shopping outside peak hours or using delivery or drive services).
Finally, the shipment of items from geographic areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be discontinued. An infectious disease preparedness and response plan can be used as a guide for protective measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk associated with different workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, family and community-related risk factors, and individual worker risk factors such as advanced age or chronic disease.
They also outline the controls necessary to deal with these risks and contingency plans for situations likely to arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be the subject of national or regional recommendations.
Outbreak response objectives include reducing staff transmission, protecting people at higher risk of medical complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located influences the responses applied.
The hierarchy of risk controls forms an overall framework used in occupational health and safety in order to group risk controls in an efficient manner.
Where the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, followed by administrative controls and finally personal protective equipment.
Technical controls involve isolating employees from work-related risks without having to rely on the behaviour of workers; they can be the most cost-effective solution to be implemented.
Administrative controls refer to changes in policies or procedures at work that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected according to the worker's risk, properly adapted to the needs (e.g., breathing masks), worn correctly and systematically, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as needed, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, jobs with a lower risk of exposure have minimal professional contact with the public and other employees.
The basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory labelling, including covering the mouth and nose to cough and sneeze, providing handkerchiefs and garbage cans, preparing for telework or scheduled hours of work as required, discouraging workers from using other workers' tools and equipment, and maintaining routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infectious individuals is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others in a workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States recommend that employees with acute respiratory disease symptoms stay at home until they no longer have fever, signs of fever or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of febrile or other symptoms-related medications, and that flexible sick leave policies be applied, that employees be allowed to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be informed of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs at risk of medium exposure include those requiring frequent or close contact, less than six feet (1.8 m), of persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but who may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community transmission around the company's headquarters or because the person has recently made an international trip to an area with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
This includes workers in contact with the general public especially in schools, high-density working environments and certain high-volume retail environments. Technical controls for this group and those at higher risk include the installation of highly effective air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic windows and the installation of a drive window for customer service. The administrative controls for this group and those at higher risk include the encouragement of sick workers to stay at home, the development of virtual communication plans, the establishment of a forum to respond to workers' concerns, the provision of information and day-training on the risk factors of COVID-19 and the behaviour that include the development of emergency communication plans, including the provision of a forum to meet workers' s' s' concerns, the provision of information to workers and the day training on the risk factors of COVID-19 and the safety.
Workers in this risk group rarely need to use breathing masks.
If a person falls ill on board an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the patient from the others by a distance of 6 feet, designating a crew member to look after the patient and providing a protective mask for the patient, or asking the patient to cover his or her mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, if possible, additional personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or breathing difficulties.
Gloves and other disposable items must be discarded in a bag intended for biological hazardous waste and contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected thereafter. For commercial navigation, including cruise and other passenger vessels, risk controls include the postponement of travel in the event of illness, as well as self-isolation and immediate information from the on-board medical centre if a fever or other symptoms develop on board.
Ideally, medical follow-up should take place in the isolated person's cabin. For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends a short-term closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has visited a school building, regardless of community spread.
In the event of minimal to moderate community transmission, strategies of social distance can be implemented, such as cancelling educational outings, assemblies and other important gatherings such as physical education or choir classes or meals at the canteen, increasing space between offices, staggering arrival and exit times, reducing non-essential visitors and using a separate infirmary for children with influenza symptoms.
In the event of significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, an extension of school holidays may be considered. For law enforcement agencies performing routine day-to-day activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who are required to contact persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 must follow the same guidelines as paramedics, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In case of close contact during arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their equipment and service belt prior to reuse using a household towel or spray detergent and follow standard procedures for containment and disposal of used PPE and for containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers some health and funeral workers to be in high or very high risk categories of exposure.
High-exposure jobs include health care, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers with a very high risk of exposure if they perform aerosol-producing procedures or take or manipulate patient samples with COVID-19 suspected or known.
Aerosol-producing procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, certain dental examinations and procedures, or invasive sampling.
High-risk funeral jobs include workers involved in the preparation of bodies of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they move to a very high risk of exposure if they perform an autopsy. Additional technical controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including when performing aerosol-producing procedures.
Specialized negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and funeral settings.
Samples shall be handled using level 3 biosecurity precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends separating patients entering separate waiting rooms based on COVID-19 suspicion. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends breathing masks for those working within 6 feet of patients with a suspected or known SARS-CoV-2 infection and for those performing aerosol-producing procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved or superior N95 filtration breathing masks should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that includes adaptation, training and medical examinations.
Other types of breathing masks can provide superior protection and comfort for the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by body fluids.
The WHO recommends that a surgical mask be worn only by screening personnel at the point of entry.
For those who collect respiratory samples, manage or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol procedures, the WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective goggles or face screen, blouse and gloves.
In the case of aerosol-producing procedures, the surgical mask shall be replaced by a respiratory mask N95 or FFP2.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends limiting the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting access to a space occupied by a COVID-19 patient to those directly involved in his / her care, the use of PPE for the specific task only, the continued use of the same respiratory mask without removing it for the management of several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the PPE supply chain and the deterrence of the use of masks for asymptomatic individuals.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Lighten the load and prepare for the future
DATE / TIME OF TRANSMISSION: 14 March 2020, 00: 24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No reserved rights
This month we find ourselves in an exceptional situation.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our overall human interconnectedness and our responsibilities to each other.
Its challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the kind of empathy, cooperation and community building that is at the heart of this organization worldwide.
The camaraderie and benevolence that we have observed among all our colleagues in e-mails, phone calls and instant conversations is a remarkable testimony to the incredible human beings with whom we have the chance to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud of all of you being among my colleagues.
Last week, someone expressed to me their gratitude for our work.
This person reminded me of how important it is for the world to be able to consult Wikipedia at this time, and the strong symbol that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible thanks to your work, whether you maintain the operational sites, ensure the payment of our colleagues or the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information provided by Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but also how we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you play in it, we will make significant adjustments to the way we work together from next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team-c met last night to discuss our approach and schedule in the days and months ahead.
During this conversation, we considered what we felt would be an appropriate response to the situation we are facing and how best to ensure the sustainability of the organization during this period.
Above all, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to step back, don't worry.
To all staff, subcontractors and contractors:
Our daily working time target will be about 4 hours a day, 20 hours a week until further notice.
We do not declare a holiday: if you are able to ensure more normal working hours, you may be useful to the mission.
However, the world is unpredictable at the moment, and if you need to take care of your loved ones, shop or consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not watching your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
It should go without saying, but we say so.
No sick leave or paid leave required: simply notify your supervisor and help your team revise schedules and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are covered.
(If you are diagnosed positive at COVID-19, please notify Bryan of the T & amp; C Ops department for T & amp; C to help you and ensure that your situation receives the necessary management attention).
The hourly staff will be paid in full.
We have already announced this, and we reiterate our commitment to honour our responsibilities to our subcontractors and colleagues in the hourly staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal conditions.
This applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to relieve their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like this.
Once again, the goal is to preserve you.
We simply ask you to contact your superior so that we know what to expect and can make the necessary arrangements.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust & amp; Security and Fundraising teams (among others) are doing essential work that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess current objectives and focus on supporting the core tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for all of us, we will simply focus on the most essential projects.
Slow down now won't hurt later.
We do not intend to "work twice as hard to make up for lost time" when the pandemic has passed.
We will not ask you to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we will strive to establish new targets and timelines where appropriate.
What about the APA (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt to our new reality and to the daily working time targets, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, take care of themselves and their loved ones while adapting to those who need or want to see their working hours reduced in the coming weeks.
This time extension significantly reduces the workload and pressure of current planning across the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and inform delegates and teams of the next steps as soon as they are confirmed.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
Situation, exposure and cleaning of the office
Last week we learned that one of our San Francisco-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a matter of caution, we used an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and elevator cages leading to our floor.
The building uses its own due diligence protocol, which uses products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We are confident that the office will be well prepared when we decide to return to it.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork office, which shared with us and all Washington DC-based staff its COVID-19 protocol.
Since last week, our Washington DC office has adopted a fully remote configuration according to San Francisco's advice.
As some of our New York-based colleagues know, we also discussed the idea of renting a premises in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be deferred.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues used to remote work are aware that adaptation can be difficult and would like to offer you some advice:
Reduce the duration of meetings to sessions of up to one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider allocating them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting, have an agenda and send documentation in advance.
Make videos the norm, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage collaboration and live exchanges.
Have a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor the instant conversation and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or make a collective note-taking).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need a comfortable helmet.
Use your wellness rebate for snacks.
Join the # memories channel on Slack to talk with your colleagues about the distribution of work
The HR Operations team is studying webinar-based ergonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of the Community grant to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as edit-a-thons, until the WHO announces the end of the pandemic.
We explained to them that we understand that our requests for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to carry out their agreed grant activities and that no one would be penalized for delays or changes in these objectives.
Next week, we will issue additional guidelines on Wikimania and other thematic and regional community conferences.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be both sadness at the upheaval and relief at the clarity and ability to focus on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
As for the remainder, the TRM is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide space for the community to monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Keep in touch despite COVID-19 problems
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary staff meeting next Thursday, 14: 00 UTC / 07: 00 PT.
We will take advantage of this time to share other updates, answer your questions and spend time together.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
Until then, you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all other essential information related to COVID-19, on Office Wiki.
The TRC will update these pages and gather all information in the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communication with staff members residing in countries that are currently seriously affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, large workflow or coverage difficulties, or if you need help with anything else, do not hesitate to notify and work with the TRM.
We are here to support you and liaise if necessary.
For confidential or sensitive questions, please send an e-mail to Bryan Judan, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as an abandonment of our work and our obligations.
On the contrary, it is a matter of recognizing that at the present time our work and our obligations will probably have to adapt in an unprecedented way.
These are the steps we deem necessary to support each other and to be able to continue our work, to provide our movement with the help it needs, and to provide the world with the service that everyone can count on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to help each other and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps in the months ahead.
We need each and every one of you to do this, which is why you must preserve yourself and take care of your families so that you can give the best of yourself in the right time.
Finally, please: wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, the TRC (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the management team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
b'L'enzyme for angiotensin 2 conversion (ACE2) is an enzyme linked to the outer face (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney and intestines.
ACE2 against angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) activity by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a M2 domain of N-terminated peptidase and a collection domain of C-terminated renal amino acid transporter.
ACE2 is a single-pass type I membrane protein, whose enzyme active domain is exposed to the surface of lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme called sheddase; the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and finally excreted into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is linked to the cell membrane mainly in cells of type II pulmonary alveoli, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial cells of smooth muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 mRNA is also present in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to compensate for ACE.
ACE cleaves the hormone angiotensin I to vasoconstrictor angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn cleans the carboxyl amino acid phenylamine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis to vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also clit several other peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphine A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 is the primary entry point into the cells of some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus).
Specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spicule S1 protein to the ACE2 enzyme domain at the cell surface results in both the endocytosis and the translocation of both virus and enzyme into the endosomes within the cells.
This entry process also requires the initiation of the S protein by TMPRSS2 host serine protease, which is currently being investigated as a potential treatment. This leads some to believe that reduced levels of ACE2 in cells may contribute to the control of infection.
However, several professional companies and regulatory bodies recommended continuing standard treatment with ACE inhibitors and CBAs.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012 showed that "the use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls."
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less conclusive than for the overall risk of pneumonia. "
The recombinant human angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (rhACE2) is considered an innovative treatment of severe lung lesions and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the duration of action is 30 minutes in addition to the 24-hour duration of effect.
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 could be a promising drug for people who are intolerant to conventional renin-angiotensin (RAS) inhibitors or for diseases with high angiotensin II circulation. Infusion-administered rhACE2 has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact tracing in the context of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the identification of individuals ("contacts") who may have come into contact with an infected individual.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some jurisdictions and jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact tracing applications.
These systems, particularly those based on tracking the geographical location of application users, raise privacy issues.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration into their Android and iOS operating systems of a feature that supports these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese government, in association with Alipay, has deployed an app in China that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with persons carrying COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore has opted for an application called TraceTogether.
Developed by a local IT community, it has been provided as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!," a Bluetooth application that tracks exposure to potentially infected people and communicates quickly with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government stated that the contact tracing application was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed in the coming weeks. A similar application is planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are planning to implement applications using the TraceTogether model in Singapore and on the basis of the BlueTrace protocol. Russia wants to introduce a georepersion application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and residing in Moscow, to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Safety Engineering at the University of Cambridge, spoke of several practical problems that could arise from the use of application-based systems, including false positives and potential inefficiencies if only a small portion of the population uses the application.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful coronavirus applications, Apple only allows "official" or generally trusted organizations to add coronavirus-related applications to the App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Privacy activists have expressed concern about the implications of coronavirus applications for mass surveillance, in particular the possible dismantling of the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic once the threat is removed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for the limitation of such surveillance.
These organizations have stipulated eight conditions to be met in government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extensions of control and surveillance should include sunset clauses;
the use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating COVID-19;
data security and anonymity should be demonstrably protected;
digital surveillance should ensure that discrimination and marginalization are not exacerbated;
any sharing of data with third parties should be defined in law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and remedies for citizens in the event of abuse;
The "meaningful participation" of all "relevant stakeholders" would be mandatory, including public health experts and marginalized groups. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google / Apple aims to address the problem of the persistence of surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism of the operating system of their devices as soon as it is no longer necessary.
Some countries have used a network geolocation system instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracing.
In Israel, network tracing has been approved.
Network solutions with access to raw geolocation data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems based on central servers need access to personal location data; several systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication, thus ensuring privacy (see next section).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to trace contacts.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collected tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking and card transaction data, which they then associated to send SMS alerts to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to the use of this information to warn potential contacts, the government also made location information publicly available, which was allowed as a result of extensive changes to the laws protecting the confidentiality of information following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is available to the public through several applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized privacy systems.
Details had not yet been communicated on 6 April 2020.
The tracking of privacy-friendly contacts is a well-established concept, supported by a large amount of research data as early as 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, including using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination effort that combines centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT / DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, formerly known as Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols ensure that identifiable personal data never leave the device and that all matches are made on the device.
The Privacy Group of MIT Media Lab is currently developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of privacy technologies when collecting and using location or contact data to track the spread of COVID-19.
This technique is based on the results of the White Paper "Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" published in March 2020. Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a company developing privacy technologies originally founded at MIT Media Lab, is another similar effort.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and authorities, without compromising their confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the TCN International Coalition was founded by groups gathered around a common approach and essentially equivalent protocols, in order to reduce fragmentation and ensure global interoperability of tracing and alert applications, an essential factor in their adoption by a broad public.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced the publication of the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used in its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracing initiative, declaring that it would preserve privacy and combine Bluetooth Low Energy technology with a cryptography that ensures confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be deployed in three phases:
deployment of tools to enable governments to create formal privacy-sensitive coronavirus tracking applications
direct integration of this feature into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the problems of solution adoption and persistence of surveillance by initially distributing the system through operating system updates and subsequently deleting it in the same way once the threat is removed.
The repositioning of a medicinal product (also known as reprofiling, reprofiling, reassignment or change in therapeutic indication of a medicinal product) means the repositioning of a medicinal product approved for a disease or medical condition different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is an area of scientific research currently being studied to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research areas include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion from convalescent individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 therapeutic target proteins, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites provides the realistic project for the development of an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-type protease, RNA-dependent polymerase RNA, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribose phosphatase.
Hussein A A, et al., studied several candidate compounds and then optimized and analyzed to determine their structural similarity to the most similar approved drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in their preclinical study to be recommended in the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine also used against certain autoimmune diseases.
On March 18, the WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State trials for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorized under the EU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot be treated in a clinical trial.
The CDC stated that "the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-VOC-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Physicians have indicated that they use this medicine "when there is no other option."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Further studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy test for the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective."
35 Shenzhen patients were tested negative within an average of 4 days while the duration of the disease was 11 days in the 45 patients who had not received it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiracvir and the other half received umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency has reminded the public that the evidence in favour of the medicine is thin and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase the medicine from Japan for its reserves and use the army to deliver the medicine to university hospitals where the medicine would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has opened up possibilities for Trump administration to acquire the drug. The drug may be less effective in serious cases of the disease where the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women attempting to procreate.
A study of lopinavir / ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed."
These drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify these drugs to find a compound that would link with the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about the use of resources to reposition drugs specifically developed for HIV / AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir / ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdésivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus and Marburg viral infections. Gilead Sciences then discovered that remdésivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramyxoviruses and coronavirus.
One problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can lead to more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one involving people with moderate pathology and one involving those with more severe forms.
There are three ongoing intravenous vitamin C clinical trials for those hospitalized and severely ill with COVID-19; two placebo-controlled trials (China and Canada) and one non-controlled trial (Italy).
New York State began testing for azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
The Japanese National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhalation corticosteroid used for asthma, for the treatment of pre-symptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
One form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, a phase II trial is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from among the severe cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung complications in patients with moderate symptoms of COVID-19.
The COLORONA study recruits 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 positive and show moderate symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant or lactating women or women who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, prompting the Italian Medicines Agency to issue guidelines on its use.
A multicentre study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic assays was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, many researchers have focused on repositioning approved antiviral drugs that have been developed for earlier outbreaks such as MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositionable as treatments for COVID-19:
tocilizumab (IL-6 anti-receptor): approved by China.
Trials are also underway in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab # COVID-19.
A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has passed clinical tests, many developmental attempts are underway.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that no vaccine was expected against SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the disease, for at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were in the process of a Phase I safety study.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic has emerged around the world in 2020, generating significant investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential SARS-CoV-2 vaccines.
Defined in April, the imperatives of the CEPI vaccine development initiative are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were conducting research and development projects in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main platform's targets for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, adenoviral vector type 5)
As stated by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development of which 78 (79 according to Milken Institute) are confirmed as active and 37 others are announced, but with little public information available (suspected planning or design).
A Phase I-II trial conducts preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and conducted in several centres while determining more accurate effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse reactions at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccine candidates (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in the human assessment phase (still in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020, the University of Queensland announced that it was studying the potential of a molecular clamp vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
Around January 24, 2020, in Canada, the University of Saskatchewan's International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) announced that it had started working on a vaccine, which is expected to begin human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were announced at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020, and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they have started working on the development of a vaccine.
Janssen develops an oral vaccine in collaboration with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emerging BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document on the design of a vaccine with a technology similar to that of neoantigen vaccination used for cancer treatment.

On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they were working on 11 isolates and that even under accelerated procedures, it would take about a year and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported developing a particle similar to coronavirus with partial funding from Canadian health research institutes.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human testing scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, the Guardian announced that US President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "large sums of money to benefit from exclusive access to the COVID-19 vaccine," which aroused protest from the German government.
On March 17, 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNtech for the joint development of a mRNA-based vaccine.
The candidate for BNT162 mRNA vaccine is currently undergoing pre-clinical testing with the start of clinical trials expected in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020 in Italy, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it would have pre-clinical test results in April 2020 and that the man test of its final vaccine candidate could start in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of US $4.9 million in a consortium for the research of a vaccine against COVID-19, including the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing CEPI's total investment in the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to US $29 million.
Other CEPI investment partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, Oxford University and the University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists had started animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on March 20, 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of sending the sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C $275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C $192 million dedicated to the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with plans to create a national "vaccine bank" containing several new vaccines that could be used if further outbreaks of coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the Pittsburgh University School of Medicine reported testing PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "micronutrient SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccine subunits triggered a significant response of antigen-specific antibodies [in mice] observed 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the design of a DNA-based vaccine candidate in the form of a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate in human bacteria to produce harmless particles similar to virus particles that could stimulate antibody production against SARS-CoV-2 by the immune system.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities pooled their resources to access IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud-based computer resources hosted by Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterogeneous effects, also known as non-specific effects.
This means that they can offer benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia plans to include 4,170 healthcare professionals.
Vaccines under development may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the effectiveness of a vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal models, such as transgenic ACE-2 mice, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicates a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for handling live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardized safety procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines were tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no cure or protection against SARS that has demonstrated both its safety and effectiveness in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was a priority for governments and health agencies around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was thought that existing SARS research could serve as a model for developing vaccines and drugs against MERS-CoV infection.
By March 2020, only one MERS vaccine (based on DNA) had completed the Phase I clinical trials in humans and three were in progress; all vaccines were viral-vector, two adenoviral-vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S) vaccines.
Social media publications have disseminated a conspiracy theory that the COVID-19 virus was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited in various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains such as the SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, sore throat, loss of taste and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
While the majority of cases result in moderate symptoms, some progress towards viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported worldwide in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have healed. The virus spreads mainly during close contact, often in droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speaking.
Because these droplets are produced after expiry, they generally fall to the ground or on surfaces rather than represent an infectious risk over long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although contagion is possible before the onset of symptoms and during subsequent phases of the disease. The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The use of masks is recommended for those who think they are infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations regarding the use of the mask by the general public vary, with some authorities refusing to use the mask, others recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
There are currently no specific vaccines or antiviral treatments for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop flu symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and a blue face or lips; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advisable to seek medical attention immediately.
Less frequently, upper respiratory symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be observed.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea have been observed in varying proportions.
Some cases in China initially presented only chest pressure and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease can cause pneumonia, multiple organ failure and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can be up to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will do so within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected people will develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully known, however preliminary evidence suggests that they could contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected persons without symptoms is currently unknown and under study. Korean Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1; of 166 infections reported today, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of the test.
Both sputum and saliva can carry significant viral loads.
Talking loud releases more droplets than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without protection can project droplets at a distance of 4.5 metres (15 feet).
Although the virus is generally not transported by air, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by bioaerosol may be possible and that air collectors positioned in the corridor outside the patient's chambers have produced viral RNA positive samples.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may disperse respiratory secretions and thus cause aerial propagation.
Although there are concerns about stool spread, this risk is perceived to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread may be possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three others. The virus survives hours or even days on the surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was detected after one day on cardboard, three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies with humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used properly; soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus, deactivating it and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical disinfectant) are less effective; in a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
Coronavirus 2 associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, initially isolated from three individuals with pneumonia related to the outbreak of acute Wuhan respiratory disease.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the wild-related coronavirus.
Apart from the human body, the virus is destroyed by household soap, which breaks its protective envelope. The SARS-CoV-2 is a close relative of the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus has access to host cells via the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (pepler) to bind to ACE 2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart damage has been reported in 12% of people admitted to Wuhan Hospital, China, and is more common when the disease is more severe.
Cardiovascular symptoms are elevated due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, however acute myocardial lesions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the cardiac functions involved.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolic disease (25%) was observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with an adverse prognosis. Autopsies of deceased COVID-19 patients showed diffuse alveolar damage (ADD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-VOC-2 has a tropism for the epithelial airway cells that express ACE-2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, the secretive T-cells of GM-CSF were associated with the recruitment of IL6-secreting inflammatory monocytes and with severe pulmonary disease in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocyte infiltrates were also reported at the autopsy.
WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method uses the reverse transcription of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on respiratory samples obtained by nasopharyngeal sampling; however, nasal or sputum sampling may also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours, or up to two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a strain from the coronavirus and have published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world have been able to develop independently of polymerization chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect virus infection.
On April 4, 2020, antibody tests (likely to detect active infections and previous infection of a person) were under development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience revealed an accuracy of only 60-70%.
FDA in the United States approved the first test in the nearest patient on March 21, 2020, to be used at the end of this month. Diagnostic guidelines published by Zhongnan Hospital at the University of Wuhan suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Multi-lobar, peripheral, asymmetric, and posterior opacity in depolite bilateral glass is typical symptoms visible at the beginning of the infection.
Dominance under pleural, crazy paving (interlobular septal thickening with variable alveolar clamping) and consolidation may occur with disease progression.
Little data are available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings at the autopsy are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Moderate pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocytic hyperplasia, extensive atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and formation of multi-nucleated giant cells
Severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
Pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded areas, frequently washing hands with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and using the inside of the elbow in the absence of a handkerchief.
Correct hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommended that the face be covered with tissue in public places to limit transmission in the case of asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, reducing travel and cancelling large groupings of people.
Distance directives also include a minimum distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) between people.
There are no drugs known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since a vaccine is not expected before 2021 at the earliest, a key element in the management of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the epidemic peak, which is also called "flatter the curve."
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in the toilet or when the hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after having faked, coughed, or sneezed.
It also recommends the use of an alcohol-based hand sanitizer solution containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and soap are not available. For areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO proposes two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is derived from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial spores from alcohol, it is "not an active antiseptic substance for the hands."
Glycerol is added as humectant.
People are treated with supportive care that may include water treatment, oxygen therapy and support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a healthy lifestyle and a healthy diet were recommended to promote immunity.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with moderate symptoms at the early stage of infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of hospitalized patients for COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumologists in the United States have collected therapeutic recommendations from several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
In terms of symptoms, some healthcare professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibuprofen in the front line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, especially under conditions of care when procedures can generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
For healthcare professionals caring for persons with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that the person be placed in an air-adapted isolation chamber (IIRA) in addition to the standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions for air transmission. The CDC outlines the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is PPE blouse, respirator or facial mask, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, breathing masks (face masks) are preferred.
The N95 breathing masks are approved under industrial conditions, but the FDA has authorized the use of these masks under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect airborne particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
Where masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face protection screens, or as a last resort, hand-made masks.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of cases are severe.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is actively studied for hospitalized individuals. There is evidence that intubation can be prevented by using a high-flow nasal cannula or positive double-level airway pressure.
It is not known whether one or both of them generate the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some physicians prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because it limits the diffusion of aerosol particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in older adults (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per person, which limits the ability of the care system to treat a sudden peak in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5% of cases were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% required respiratory assistance and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally admitted to intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilation devices with high pressure control and PEEP are required to optimize oxygen delivery and minimize the risk of lung damage associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation appliances.
The search for potential treatments started in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are the subject of clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new drugs may not be developed before 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved in other indications and tests are already advanced.
An antiviral medicine can be tried in people with severe illness.
The WHO has recommended volunteers to participate in trials on the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization to plasma convalescent individuals for experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is seriously or immediately threatened.
It has not been subjected to the clinical trials necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to manage the epidemic.
Users are asked to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect "close contacts" using surveillance data and thus detect a potential risk of infection.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-quarantine, it also alerts local health authorities. Analyzing massive data from mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone localization and artificial intelligence are used to locate infected people and those they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to locate the mobile phone data of persons suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was designed to enforce quarantine and protect persons who may have been in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated telephone location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyse and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect non-quarantine persons.
In Italy, regional health minister Giulio Gallera said he was informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to move."
The German government led a 48-hour hackathon weekend with over 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaud has launched a global call for creative solutions to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
People may suffer from quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, "increased social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are a perfect cocktail to harm people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may have a moderate progression with little or no symptoms, resembling other common respiratory diseases such as cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection based on similar data from viruses such as SARS and MERS, however there is a lack of data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In the most severely affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiorgan failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders, and cardiac, renal and hepatic lesions.
Coagulation disorders, in particular an increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, with renal impairment in 4% of patients in this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, patients transferred to intensive care had an average duration of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the mean duration between onset of symptoms and death was 14 days, with a total range of 6-41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage with fibromyxoid cell exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The lung image resembles an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage due to high troponin levels or cardiac arrest was observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalized people had pre-existing pathologies. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic conditions in a region can also have an impact on mortality.
Estimates of the death rate of the disease vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercoverage of moderate cases may lead to an overstatement of mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of previously contracted cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are 2.4 times more likely to go to intensive care or die than non-smokers. Concerns have also arisen about the long-term consequences of the disease.
The Hong Kong hospital administration has observed a 20-30% drop in respiratory capacity in some people cured of the disease, and lung scanners suggest organic lesions.
This may also lead to post-recovery intensive care syndrome.
In March 2020, it was not known whether a previous infection provided effective long-term immunity for those cured of the disease.
Immunity is considered probable, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus patients, but cases of COVID-19 cured individuals followed by coronavirus positive tests at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered to be an aggravation of latent infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and of animal origin, by spreading the infection.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost exclusively carried out by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet found that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first onset of symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Several measures are generally used to assess mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, therapeutic options, the time elapsed since the outbreak began, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 U07.1 emergency pathological codes for laboratory-confirmed deaths of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for deaths of clinically or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. The death / case ratio reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global death / case ratio is 6.9% (153,822 / 2,240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR) that reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who die from the disease and the infectious fatality rate (IRF) that reflects the percentage of infected individuals (whether diagnosed or not) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination at the end of the disease.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may indicate the number of people who have been infected.
In the epicentre of the epidemic in Italy, in Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4,600 inhabitants, 80 of them (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread through festivals, and to young people, resulting in a relatively low mortality rate, and not all COVID-19-related deaths may have been officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overrun.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of people can have antibodies, according to an assessment of blood donors.
69 deaths (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to be related to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in humans in studies in China and Italy.
The risk is highest among 50-year-old men, with the difference between men and women disappearing only at age 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8% for men and 1.7% for women.
The precise reasons for this gender difference are unknown, but genetics and behavioural factors may be part of it.
Immunological differences by sex, the lower prevalence of smoking among women, and the development in men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected individuals were men and 72% of the deceased of COVID-19 were men.
In April 2020, the U.S. government did not collect data related to the type of COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, particularly nurses, are women and are at increased risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19."
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 being the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name has been chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in its public communication.
Both disease and virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus."
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often called "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus."
In January 2020, WHO recommended the use of the provisional disease names 2019-nCov and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 directive against the use of places in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Given the capacity limitations of standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print care equipment such as swabs and respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital needed an emergency respirator valve and the supplier could not supply it in a timely manner, a local startup retrofitted and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
After the initial COVID-19 epidemic, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation emerged about the origin, extent, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread online.
It seems that man is capable of spreading the disease to some other animals.
Studies have not found evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines are approved to treat the disease.
International research on vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 is currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY trial" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the most promising efficacy.
There are no vaccines available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used as both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE 2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are trying to create an entire virus vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to cause a rapid immune response to the human body in the event of a new infection with COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit-based vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spiral S protein that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE 2 receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccination, a new vaccine creation technique).
Experimental vaccines from all of these strategies should be tested in terms of safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent activation has been suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, but it is controversial.
By April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are underway.
Seven trials evaluated previously approved malaria treatments, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Reconverted antiviral drugs constitute the majority of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials on remdesivir in several countries whose reports are expected at the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of candidate vaccines and drugs against COVID-19 was also in place in April 2020. Several existing antiviral drugs are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir / ritonavir and lopinavir / ritonavir in combination with interferon beta.
Preliminary data suggest the efficacy of remdésivir in March 2020.
Clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of the research.
The Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Virology Institute, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, indicates that twice that dose is highly hazardous and could be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine under an emergency use authorization at the discretion of physicians treating COVID-19 patients. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for continuation of an in vivo study after demonstrating low-concentration inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial spicule protein initiating with serine-2 transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 via interaction with ACE 2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from taking these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokinic shock may be a complication at later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokinic shock properties. tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study was conducted.
It is being tested for phase 2, which is not randomised nationally in Italy, after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokinic shock, it must counteract such developments that are suspected to cause the deaths of some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome, CAR T cells, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for RCS.
The transfer of concentrated and purified antibodies produced by immune systems from individuals who have cured COVID-19 to those who need it is being studied as a non-vaccine passive immunization method.
This strategy has been tested for SARS with few conclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mode of action by which passive antibody-based therapy can generate a defence against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and / or phagocytosis may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibiotic treatment, for example using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
Serum production from convalescent individuals, consisting of the liquid part of the blood of cured patients containing specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster deployment.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the central hospital in Wuhan, who then contracted the COVID-19 and died after drawing attention to the spread of the virus.
