Inflation in Europe has slipped on food
Accelerated inflation, measured in the euro area, is mainly due to the rapid rise in food prices.
In November, the price increase in the 13 euro area countries was higher than expected, after an inflation rate of 2.6 per cent in October, annual inflation of 3.1 per cent was recorded, according to the European Community statistics office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts indicated only 3 per cent, said Bloomberg.
Unlike the US, UK and Canadian central banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) did not lower the policy interest rate by saying that lower interest rates, together with higher commodity prices and lower unemployment rates, would lead to the generation of an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below but close to two per cent.
According to one analyst, it is the Catch 22 for the ECB: "we must deter" inflation so that we no longer have to intervene on this subject at a later date.
In Germany, the inflation rate of 3.3 per cent has been a record in the last 12 years and in Spain it has risen from 3.6 to 4.1.
Inflation in the euro area has picked up due to the rapid rise in food and energy prices.
Cereal futures market ratings have increased by 88 per cent and soya prices have also reached their highest value since 1973.
The price of food oil and dairy products also increased significantly in 2007.
This year, the world oil price increased by 52 per cent and last month, a barrel of black gold cost almost $100.
According to the ECB, in 2008 the inflation rate will rise from 2.1 this year to 2.5 per cent, but in 2009 it will fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the 12-month inflation rate remains around 3 per cent, however, over the next 3 to 4 months the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to reduce the key rate twice in 2008.
Gallup indicates government crisis
After a long stagnation, the number of supporters of the Fidesz (Alliance of Young Democrats) increased significantly at the beginning of December. Thus, since 2002, it currently has the largest number of supporters, while Gallup (Survey Institute) has never seen such a low level of socialist support, namely 13 per cent.
For the faithful voters, the difference would represent, because of the greater determination of the opposition voters, support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) against the support of a fifth (20 per cent) for the MSZP (Hungarian Socialist Party).
According to the survey, the MDF (Forum of Hungarian Democrats) and the SZDSZ (Alliance of Free Democrats) are below the threshold of parliamentarians: their support is two per cent for the entire population.
Of the faithful voters certain to go to vote, the number of supporters of both parties increased by 1 percent.
The economic climate has continued to deteriorate compared to the previous lowest point, the proportion of those who considered the country's economic situation to be particularly serious has never been higher, it amounts to 41 per cent and, according to 46 per cent, the situation is rather serious.
After the more optimistic prospects of last spring and summer, families are again more pessimistic about their financial situation.
For next year, the majority of the population is planning a worsening and only one tenth is planning an improvement.
Last December, 71 percent of those surveyed, a majority never seen in previous Gallup polls, felt that the Prime Minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
13 percent of respondents trust or much trust in Ferenc Gyurcsány while 38 percent support Viktor Orbán.
54 percent do not trust the Prime Minister at all and 27 percent do not trust the President of Fidesz.
One indicator of the change in the political situation is the proportion of society who believe that dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister can be dealt with without a change of government.
While after the October riots, 35 per cent of the respondents wanted the government and the Prime Minister to remain in office, at present this rate is only 20 per cent. The relative majority (33 per cent) believes that the holding of new elections would be the solution to this situation.
To the question concerning the intention to vote, 60 per cent of the respondents replied that they would certainly vote and the additional 20 per cent said that they would probably vote.
To make the comparison, for a "legislative election to be held next Sunday," only 55 per cent of the respondents would certainly participate and 15 per cent would probably participate. Depending on current intentions, the result of the referendum would not be in doubt.
74 per cent would say no to tuition fees in higher education, 79 per cent would say no to consultation fees and 84 per cent would say no to hospital living expenses.
When we look only at the same proportions of those who expressed their intention to vote in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters respectively would reject the introduction of registration fees, consultation fees and hospital living expenses.
Auchan is the most expensive, Tesco has increased its prices by nearly twenty percent
The hypermarkets in the Budaörs commercial triangle maintained the average price increase of 16 per cent last year, except that this year the VAT rate did not increase.
Article by Napi Gazdaság (Daily Economy)
This year, in the Budaörs commercial triangle, the usual daily Christmas basket also increased by an average of 16 percent, a value increase well above a thousand forints was displayed in all hypermarkets.
Prices, "which had already flown off" in major food stores last December, no longer rose sharply compared to the previous high base.
However, consumers are obviously shocked to see that the items purchased clearly below nine thousand forints last year now cost more than ten thousand forints.
The daily basket in the hypermarkets surveyed exceeded the psychological threshold of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
And the highest value in the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the value was 6,800 forints.)
Prices for Unicum and live fish remained close to last year's level, but prices for turkey fillet, walnuts and poppy rose sharply.
In the stores, the price of flour and bread followed the data of the KSH (Central Institute of Statistics) but, at Auchan, bread was found from a kilo to 139 forints only.
Competition did not lower the price of the product below 200 forints.
It was surprising to see, also in this hypermarket, that the price of the two-litre recorded bottle of Coca-Cola was below 200 forints, so it cost only 257 forints of the recorded bottle included therein.
However, this year, in terms of daily Basket, Auchan was the most expensive and Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, Cora increased the price of its daily Basket by 15 percent while Tesco and Auchan increased it by about 18 percent and 18 percent respectively.
Comparing the most expensive basket of last year with the cheapest basket of this year, we see a difference of 12 percent while the difference between the cheapest of last year and the most expensive of this year is 21 percent.
Prices increased by an average of 1,480 forints.
Last year, prices increased by an average of 1,206 forints, although the impact of the increase in VAT rates was already noted in last year's Christmas prices.
As a result of this process, trade was perplexed, hypermarkets could not clearly determine what margin to apply on products as they were unable to predict the impact of price change on consumption.
(If a trader miscalculates the rotation of a product, he may lose a large profit on the margin adapted to the intensity of the trade.)
As a result of the change in the VAT rate, the increase in the prices of the daily basket was so excessive that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than the value of 2006, while the difference between the cheapest baskets was only 844 forints.
This year, the difference was not so much as the value of the most expensive basket was 1,630 forints higher than last year and the price of the cheapest one also increased 1,284 forints.
When we brought the two Christmas seasons closer together, we saw a catastrophic increase in prices, in less than 20 months the prices of daily consumer items increased by more than 30 percent in hypermarkets.
(This does not necessarily confirm KSH's data: for some basic supplies, the Institute of Statistics has seen a price increase of more than 30 per cent in 12 months.
This is the case, for example, with flour and egg.)
According to the latter's daily Basket, this seems almost absurd since the price level of this product, already very expensive last year, increased by just over 10 percent compared to the base.
There are indications that flour suppliers are in a stronger position than egg suppliers because they have managed to get acceptance of the sharp price increase also by multinationals.
In the commercial golden triangle, hypermarkets do not complain, they constantly record good years.
Based on our experience, the majority of customers no longer look at prices in the three hypermarkets visited.
They buy everything in quantity, they take the long-preserved food by pallets.
Wednesday morning important tails formed at the crates of the three hypermarkets as the number of customers increased abruptly.
However, according to our information, the turnover is lower in the provinces, many multinationals complain to the survey companies that they do not even reach the expected turnover, not only for food but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand infections, mainly caused by the incorrect use of antibiotics, have been recorded in hospitals.
Hospital hygienic conditions, insufficient beds, overwork of medical staff do not help to block infections, says the Chief Medical Officer of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Many hospitals also save on disinfectants
Not long ago an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the trauma department of János Hospital.
The antibiotic-resistant bacterium was detected on a man in hospital following a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year a similar infection occurred in the same place.
The injured person in a serious car accident left the hospital but shortly afterwards had to return because of an MRSA infection and since then, the doctors have not been able to perform a major operation because of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1,094 hospital infections generated by a multi-resistant pathogen were reported to the National Nosocomial Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröcz, Chief Medical Officer of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
Namely, it is the number of infections caused by a multi-resistant pathogen that has actually been recorded in hospitals and for the rest we have no information.
Approximately two thirds of the infections (683 infections) were caused by MRSA, i.e. by methicillin-oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
One third of people carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their noses without developing disease.
Infections caused by SA (such as angina, tonsillitis, skin infections, traumatic infections) respond well to antibiotics and are easily cured.
However, if antibiotics are used excessively or inappropriately, the bacterium, which responds well to antibiotics, will develop an antibiotic resistant bacterium that will rapidly proliferate in the wrong hospital conditions.
In the event of temporary or prolonged malfunctioning of the immune system, this bacterium can cause serious hospital infections, such as traumatic infection or sepsis, on elderly, small weight patients or patients with a weakened body.
According to the medical director of the hospital János, there is nothing particular about MRSA infections, these infections are part of the daily lives of hospitals.
We must not confuse the infection with the epidemic, we cannot find MRSA only where we are not looking for them, said Tibor Nyulasi.
HAs are resistant to antibiotics.
"These patients are isolated, care workers put rubber gloves and protective masks on and we have antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
A priori, hospitalized patients are examined if they carry MRSA, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in mode
The vast majority of MRSA infections could be prevented, but current conditions and circumstances in Hungarian hospitals are not favourable to prevent the development and proliferation of multi-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and seniors' homes, hospitals should monitor hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients with MRSA.
However, microbiological sampling is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
It should be noted that the National Social Security Fund does not fund such examinations.
Most cases only occur if MRSA infection is detectable on the patient, said the Chief Medical Officer of the Epidemiological Centre.
The European Union has strong recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine and there are Hungarian guidelines for the cure of certain infections and syndromes.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological testing should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always take this into account.
Microbiological sampling is even more rare in outpatient and basic care, said Karolina Böröcz.
Many hospitals save on disinfectants
Scientific evidence shows that MRSA proliferate from one patient to another most often through medical personnel.
It is therefore essential to wash your hands, put on gloves and protective masks. However, there are significant gaps in hospitals in this area as well.
The MRSA proliferate by infection transmitted by inhalation of droplets and contact. However, due to conditions in Hungarian hospitals, the infected patient cannot always be isolated.
In addition, the rooms are often full, beds are often too close to each other, whereas in terms of epidemics, patients should be kept away from each other by at least 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, we also note that hospitals, in difficult financial situation, are saving money on disinfectants, they lack nurses, there are many patients, so the risk of contamination is even greater, said Karolina Böröcz.
According to Karolina Böröcz, in hospitals where preventive measures are respected, the number of infections is less demonstrably or the spread of the pathogen can be blocked.
Government project against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection represents exorbitant expenditure for the social security funds, which is why it is being combated everywhere.
In England, for example, the government has established a program to prevent or reduce the incidence of MRSA.
According to published data, this program is effective and MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) identifies as one of its priorities the prevention of the incidence of multi-resistant pathogens (such as MRSA) as well as the prevention of hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The Commissioner, the author of a fatal accident, was not drunk.
The official finding regarding the fatal accident caused by the 22nd district commissioner was made.
It can be ruled out that the commissioner of the 22nd district, who has since resigned from his post, who crushed a pedestrian by causing his death last Tuesday, would have led in a state of intoxication or dizziness, announced Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Public Prosecutor's Office of the capital after the relative finding was established.
The finding confirmed the first result of the investigation which already found that the former Commissioner had not consumed alcohol before driving
Last Tuesday, the former head of the 22nd district police station crushed a 55-year-old man who was facing him when he turned, with his own car, on Kossuth Lajos Street in the 22nd district. The man wanted to cross the road by not passing through the pedestrian crossing.
(Moreover, the fact that he was crossing the road outside the pedestrian crossing does not constitute a mitigating circumstance, according to the Highway Code, a car which starts a turn must pass the pedestrians.)
The pedestrian died after being taken to the hospital.
As a result of this accident, the Commissioner resigned from his post and applied for his retirement because, according to the police report, the accident upset him very much.
The investigation into this case is carried out by the Budapest Public Prosecutor's Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former Commissioner cooperated from the beginning with the magistrates responsible for conducting the investigation.
An additional €400 million for infrastructure
János Veres, Hungarian Minister of Finance, and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed three agreements in Budapest on Friday with a total value of EUR 400 million for a credit line to support education, transport and environment infrastructure and energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million for the Hungarian budget financing of transport and environment projects to be carried out from the Cohesion Fund, of which a credit agreement worth EUR 100 million has already been signed by the parties; this time, the signed contract concerns the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement also covers budgetary funding for education-related projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for Hungary, with the remaining EUR 150 million to be used later, following the extension of the credit agreement.
The parties have signed a €50 million innovation contract, the state budget will use this envelope primarily as part of the research and development project to be carried out at Debrecen University.
During the negotiations, the metro line 4 project was also discussed.
The parties agreed that they would discuss the possible amendment of the original contract once Hungary has finalized the details of the financing of the metro with the EU.
According to János Veres, this could be done in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has granted a total of EUR 8.4 billion to finance 113 projects in Hungary.
The EIB grants its loans at the interest rate linked to EURIBOR, with a grace period of 8 years and without a commission of commitment.
Bulgaria, the paradise of the EU real estate market
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is spectacular, the attention of the whole of Europe is focused on this country of the Balkans little mentioned in the past.
What, or who and who bought on this EU market which is always the cheapest but which will quickly become expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re / Max.
Currently, in real estate, Bulgaria is unquestionably the most popular target in Eastern Europe with its ski apartments and cheap beach houses.
In the mountains, the most popular areas are Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa and, by the sea, Albena, the "Golden Sands," the "Sun Coast," the former Sozopol and Nessebar but more and more are looking for a building in the Kavarna and Balcik area as well.
According to the analysts of Re / Max Bulgaria, sooner or later, the central region of the country, namely Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna, will also arouse the interest of investors and they are also increasingly buying in the inexpensive corner of Ruse.
Sofia, the capital, offers attractive opportunities as well, the shops and offices area promises the highest depreciation rate.
Bulgaria is on the best track to become one of Europe's most attractive golf paradise and thus be a priority destination, after the summer and winter seasons, also in the other two seasons of the year.
More vigilant investors are already buying in large numbers, for example in the corner of Bansko.
According to analysts, people buying a building in Bulgaria are at the same time trying to change their lives, their way of life.
Most buyers are English, but others come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot investors are also present. On the Black Sea and in the most famous ski resorts, we have traditionally met many Russian buyers.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgij Jankov, Regional Director of Re / Max Bulgaria.
People who plan to settle buy renovated buildings, at a price ranging from 50 to 100 thousand euros, or old dilapidated houses, at a price ranging from 5 to 15 thousand euros, which are then renovated.
The criteria are easy access and communication possibilities, proximity to a large city, shops and generally to the local doctor.
The second group includes buyers of secondary residences (since last December, Bulgaria has been mentioned as one of the top 10 holiday destinations in Germany).
The third group is composed of commercial investors who buy in the hope of realising value in the medium or long term.
The price of the capital's buildings is constantly rising due to growing demand.
In the European Union, real estate prices are lowest in Bulgaria. However, in the last 5 years they have increased by 21 per cent each year.
The rise in real estate prices is mainly higher than the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six percent Hungarian
According to the communication from Gábor Fodor, Minister of the Environment and Water, the professional meetings are ending on Tuesday, yet Wednesday, after the official opening, the ministers' negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world will discuss the Bali Road Map, which is intended to define the efforts to be made after the Kyoto Protocol's emission reduction period until 2012.
At the moment, there are intense discussions on this issue between developing and developed countries.
The United States also indicated that, for the time being, it did not wish to discuss exact figures, while it was prepared to sign an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25 to 40 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020.
Another important topic of the conference is whether developed countries commit themselves, excluding emission reductions, to providing financial and technological assistance to countries in need.
An agreement has also been signed on aid to developing countries.
The support fund under the Kyoto Protocol will be managed by a 16-member board of directors, probably under the United Nations Global Environment Facility (GEF), said Piacés Profit (Market and Profit).
The six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Water Minister Gábor Fodor confirms the EU's ambition to maintain its flagship role in global efforts to protect the climate and encourage the signing of the new international agreement before 2009.
The Minister explained that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 from 1990 levels, regardless of the successful signing of the "Post-2012 Agreement," and is prepared to reduce them by up to 30 per cent if other major regions of the world and / or developing countries are also prepared to make commitments appropriate to their responsibilities and capabilities.
Gábor Fodor recalled that in 1997, the Kyoto Protocol countries had achieved a total reduction of 5.2 per cent, and all 15 EU members of that time made a commitment of 8 per cent less.
Hungary has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6 per cent compared to the period 1985-1987, and our country will fulfil its commitment, recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
The issue at stake in Bali is that the long-term international agreement on climate policy needs to be put in place within two years, otherwise the entry into force of the agreement would certainly be delayed after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments below the Kyoto Protocol values would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need for which was underlined in the new report by IPCC, an international scientific body, which has been awarded the UN Nobel Peace Prize for climate change.
The reduction in emissions would be delayed and the increase in the average temperature of the Earth by more than 2 degrees Celcius could no longer be avoided, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irrevocable consequences.
British Army Recruits on YouTube
The British Army units make available on the video-sharing site recordings made during its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan with the aim of becoming popular.
First of all, it was the British Air Force (RAF) that was passionate about YouTube: special units operating in Afghanistan are uploading video footage of operations against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC announced.
These recordings, taken using miniature helmet cameras, are monitored at Air Force Operations Headquarters in Kandahar and then transferred to Londrès where compatriots load them on the Internet.
The political message is inescapable
Air force soldiers have already passed 139 sequences on the net through this channel and their "chain" has been watched by more than 75 thousand people.
The British Ministry of Defence signed up as "defence headquarters" in the spring of 2007 and provides videos on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Commonwealth Office and the International Peacekeeping Forces in Iraq (MNFI) also have their own YouTube channels.
Mission to Afghanistan
According to the original objective of the air force, the videos were posted on the net to recruit. According to the Ministry of Defence, they were also used to inform the general public of the real objectives of the army's presence abroad.
The propaganda published through this channel costs almost nothing compared to the usual recruitment advertisements on television, communicated to the BBC's defence consultant Gordon Mackenzie. However, it also inevitably carries a political message, since it justifies in a special form the validity of the military operations decided by the government.
The Americans made a game.
The army is annoyed because, apart from the carefully composed and censored videos, amateur videos have been posted on the sharing site which also present, for example, the death of soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a bit hypocritical, the officers do not avoid talking about the losses but they never present the bloody side of the fight.
In fact, many videos had already been posted on the net showing the areas of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that were being carried out on a real mission, but the British army has only recently embarked on loading these videos.
The Americans do the recruitment a little differently by using the America's Army shooting game that can be downloaded for free. In this game the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers as part of a more or less real simulation.
Christmas raffle and doughnuts in ministries
Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not seem to be sentimental: instead of celebrating Christmas, she will hold a year-end meeting with her employees who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 by taking doughnuts and coffee.
Another ministry will host a live music party, another will enchant public servants with a raffle and offer a drink to create a Christmas atmosphere.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet, so entertains the power.
The public authorities are also preparing Christmas.
This year, the largest Christmas party will be organized by the Ministry of Defence, but it is not the employees of the Ministry who will be invited.
At Christmas, Orphans, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, for missionary Christmas, family members of soldiers currently serving in foreign missions are invited and a press reception will also take place.
The Ministry plans a budget of 25 million forints to create the atmosphere of the end of the year.
In comparison with other ministries, the National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will celebrate.
The GKM festival will be held in the House of the Future with a total budget of 4,320,000 forints and, of the six hundred employees, three hundred and fifty are expected.
At this party, the atmosphere of Christmas will be rigorous, there will be actors and also a raffle.
NFÜ Christmas cost 4,700,000 forints and was held Wednesday in the National Council of Justice (ILO) building with concerts and dinner.
The rental of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on the more than four hundred guests.
According to our information, a NFÜ service is invited to another Christmas party which is organised with European money by the National Centre for Economic Development, a company managing tenders.
The Théâtre de la Gaîté was rented for these purposes.
This information was not confirmed by MAG Zrt because we were unable to reach the person in charge.
The suit is not mandatory
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which, instead of a Christmas party, organized a dance on the occasion of Saint Luca on 7 December.
The ILO did not charge them for the use of its rooms.
There were five hundred people in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's words of welcome and the dinner was followed by a dancing evening on live music.
Answer to the question of [origo]: Evening dress was not obligatory at this dance at all.
The Ministries of Health, Labour and Local Government are preparing a sober holiday.
The Ministry of Health will organize a show and a party for its employees, in its walls, for 400,000 forints.
On the other hand, Mónika Lamperth, Minister of Labour, does not officially invite his employees to a Christmas party but to a working meeting at the end of the year.
One hundred and eighty people are expected who will be invited to have coffee and eat doughnuts, the press service said, so the party will cost only 350,000 forints.
Gordon Bajnai, Minister of Local Government, will simply invite his staff to have a drink in the Ministry of Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) will host a Christmas party in its large hall with 436 employees expected.
He plans to spend 2,500 forints per guest including a buffet and a glass.
Since the arrival of János Veres, PM employees celebrate Christmas each year in the same way.
No party atmosphere is foreseen, the official character is reinforced not only by the minister's presentation but also by the hour of the party taking place in the afternoon.
The Ministry of Agriculture will hold a reception on 20 January to celebrate the New Year, Christmas will not take place.
The reception will be held at Vajdahunyad Castle, located in Bois de ville, and according to the Ministry's communication, 1,000 forints per person are calculated for the hundred guests.
According to the press service, this will be a very simple cocktail to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be invited.
These cocktails, organized every year, are started with a few words of welcome from the Minister followed by a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not celebrate Christmas at all, have communicated to [origo] the respective press services.
The press service of the Ministry of the Environment did not know the price of the official Christmas party.
However, more than four hundred people were invited to the festival held at the Museum of Decorative Art.
The forces of the mega strike gather
On Friday, the trade unions of the League and the National Association of Workers' Councils will form their strike commission, which will be responsible for coordinating Monday's indefinite strike.
On Saturday, a general protest meeting will be held and on Monday, the day of the final vote on the law on health funds, the strike will begin.
This action will certainly cause important traffic closures as rail traffic will be stopped almost completely and BKV (public transport company) employees will also strike until 1: 00 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will announce the details of their Monday strike, organized with the National Association of Workers' Councils.
The LIGA-MOSZ strike commission will also be set up as coordinator of Monday's actions.
Saturday, a general protest assembly will be held and, from Monday, the organizations joining the strike will stop the work for an indefinite period if they fail to reach an agreement with the government.
This means that the date of the end of the strike, from the day of the vote in parliament on the law on health funds, is not defined.
If the National Assembly does not adopt the law on health funds, the trade unions will immediately withdraw the call to strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the next steps.
According to the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is likely that the vote on the Health Caisse Act will take place only late in the evening or even at night.
Due to the strike scheduled for Monday, major traffic closures are planned: the railways will stop work for an indefinite period and during the morning part of the public transport in Budapest and more than half of Volán companies are at risk of being stopped.
At the same time, at different points in the country, half of the road will be blocked as well.
Many trade unions and civil organizations have joined the call to strike, the list of these is constantly updated on the League's website.
Some organizations reported an indefinite strike, while others reported a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon the MÁV (Hungarian Railways) and the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ) failed to reach an agreement on minimum services, but, as Christmas festivities approach, more and more people are taking the train.
According to current communications, Budapest public transport will strike from the start of service until 1: 00 p.m., Budapest airport between 7: 00 a.m. and 9: 00 a.m., the League's Industrial Electricity and Thermal Energy Unions will strike for four hours, the Teachers' Union and the Democratic Teachers' Union have called for a strike for two hours and two hours to eight hours respectively.
The Association nationale des médecins will strike in alternance throughout the country, while the Syndicat des employés de la santé et du secteur social (EDDSZ) attached to the SZEF will make a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands, made by the League, requires the government to withdraw its proposal on health reform and submit a new concept to social debate.
The second claim requires that the new method of calculating retirement to be introduced from next year onwards be introduced in several stages.
The third claim is for a guarantee, in terms of retirement before the legal age, that would allow the proper functions to be transferred to the system before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is the rejection by the Free Railway Union (VDSZSZ), attached to the League Unions, of the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport concerning secondary railway lines and the expectation of another proposal.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard increased country risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed last August with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért Mozgalom (Movement for Better Hungary), increases, in several respects, the political risk of Hungary and the region.
In its "risk warning," society points out that, in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is already that "in the short term aggressive ethnic clashes can occur following the aggravation of the ethnic tension already existing between the Gypsy and non-Gypsy population of Hungary."
The research institute added that the Hungarian Guard's political strategy likely to provoke this situation is the main reason for this.
As they say, this is due to one of the main shortcomings of Hungarian political actors: "public actors have passed the public debate on the Roma affair to representatives of radical and extreme political groupings which have based a political strategy on the dispute between Gypsies and Hungarians."
The problem is compounded, normal dialogue becomes impossible, extremists are strengthened and the arrival of aggressive conflicts is more likely, they say.
However, according to the research institute, due to the increased attention of the Hungarian and international media, the activity of the Hungarian Guard "has significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, in particular regarding confidence in the stability and democratic maturity of the country."
They recall that, following greater publicity given to the reorganisation of the radical and extreme right groups in Hungary since autumn 2006, many associations have been formed in Hungary since summer 2007, calling themselves the "national self-defence association."
"The common feature of these gatherings is that they define themselves as a civil organization when they publicly declare the preparation of their members for defence missions (disasters, national defence, defence of the order), armed if necessary, by referring to the incompetence of the police, the army, or the state," they added.
They pointed out that everything was going according to the method which, based on the resentment of the political society and the parties, sought to disguise different political ambitions from a civilian point of view.
The emphasis on civil status and association status therefore serves only to avoid the legal pitfalls of registering such associations in court, but they also constitute a political strategy.
The analysis indicates that the activity of the Hungarian Guard is a factor that also increases the risk compared to neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring countries have cited the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of risk, and ultra-nationalist political actors in some neighbouring countries wish to justify their anti-Hungarian policy by referring to the Hungarian Guard's constitution.
This influences the political stability of the region, "they added.
According to the research institute, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not a unique phenomenon in Eastern Central Europe, political risks have increased throughout the region.
As they say, the functioning of the Hungarian Guard resembles, for example, the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was declared by the Bulgarian National Union (BNU) in August 2007.
The establishment of the Bulgarian Guard was prompted by the numerous incidents of Roma in a district of Sofia (Kraszna Poljana).
Taking advantage of these events, the BNU decided to set up a guard by saying that the purpose of the organization is "national self-defence."
According to them, over the past 17 years, Gypsies have "terrorized" Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and neutral, according to Political Capital.
They added that the initiative had aroused intense debate in Bulgarian public opinion.
As they say, the statement by some Bulgarian Roma organisations regarding the establishment of their own guard as a resistance indicates an increased risk of ethnic clashes.
The functioning of the Hungarian Guard with similarities to that of the Bulgarian National Guard does not preclude the Hungarian Roma from responding to the threat in the same way by organizing their own self-defence, as stated in the Political Capital risk warning.
At the request of the telegraphic agency, Attila Juhász, Research Director of Political Capital, said: risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, their risk analysis is published annually and if events occur that could impact on the change in risk, they inform the public, as in the present case, by issuing a risk warning.
The party is not marked in red everywhere
In Hungary, the law exactly defines the holiday days and around the holidays it has become common to reorganize working days, the number of which will decrease next year.
Festivals are not uniform in the EU and the US either.
Hungarian legislation distinguishes between days of national and state holidays and days of rest.
Rest days are often linked to religious holidays or important historical events.
In Hungary, we celebrate the New Year, the last day of the year ending and the first day of the New Year are also days of rest, the latter all the more so that waiters can rest quietly.
Moreover, in a year, we have a total of eleven parties marked in red.
March 15 is a national holiday in commemoration of the 1848 revolution, as is October 23, which is also the commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20, we celebrate the constitution of our state, on May 1 is Labour Day and on November 1 and 2, we remember our family and friends who died.
In addition, we have two days at Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
On the days of our state, national or religious holidays rarely falling on a weekend, according to the schedule, it has become common to reorganize working days in cases where there is only one working day before or after the celebration marked in red.
It is true that we pay the price of extended weekends by working or going to school the Saturday before the extended weekend.
For many years, the Minister of Labour has ruled in special regulations on the replacement days of the days preceding or following the holidays.
The Act extends to all employers and their employees, civil servants and persons working in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to service companies, as institutions operate continuously and in service, because of their vocation, and also for days of rest.
This year, working days will be changed only around the end-of-year holidays: as of December 24, life stops almost throughout the country, as the majority of people tend to work overtime or take vacations that they have saved for these purposes so that they can spend the days between Christmas and New Year's Day at home.
Next year many holidays fall in the middle or at the end of the week, so there will be fewer changes in working days compared to this year.
The calendar will be reorganized for the first time around Labour Day to allow employees to stay at home for four days in a row.
Saturday 25 April will be a working day to have a day off on Friday 2 May.
Another change is scheduled for October 23: Saturday, October 18 will be a working day replacing Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year, the end of the year will be celebrated, as from December 24, everyone will take a non-stop break even if New Year's Day falls on a Wednesday.
Six futile things that can annoy colleagues terribly
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that annoy us almost more: these are things that "embellish" the everyday life of a workplace.
The question is whether we get used to these problems or take up the challenge and consciously avoid ambiguous situations, causing trouble for others.
Examples.
"Excuse me, I forgot to tell you that you were called from the marketing department," a colleague told you.
That you missed a date?
At best he is sorry and tries to fix things by calling the marketing department to tell them he forgot to pass the message (this is the least common solution).
In the majority of cases, this is arranged with an apology.
Before you have any painful explanations, it is useful to think about how you can cause unpleasant moments to your colleagues and make efforts to avoid them.
Are you borrowing something that doesn't belong to you?
There's nothing more annoying than wanting to take a file, an office tool or the phone, and you can't find them anywhere.
Remember the day before you put the stapler on the desk, but she disappeared the next morning?
Do you happen to find your pen that you thought was lost on your colleague's desk?
Don't take anything from your colleagues without asking otherwise they're right to be mad at you for stealing their property.
Don't bring envelopes, post-it into your pocket because it can be bothering that there's no more envelopes and that you need them right now.
Are you talking about colleagues' privacy?
There are no good ways to stop gossip spreading.
Who did what, with whom?
Or why?
Don't tell everyone your information (assumptions) about your colleagues' privacy!
If a colleague shares his intimate secrets with you, don't abuse his trust!
Burn in you the shared information and do not discuss it with your colleagues in his absence even if your colleagues are also aware of it.
You claim to be ill without just cause?
When you call the office and declare yourself sick on the pretext of a heartbreaking headache because you feel sick or feel you need rest that day, think of the fact that your work, your urgent business, your long-term missions must be carried out by someone else in your place.
Don't bother your colleagues!
If you know in advance that the next day you won't go to work or that something might happen that would force you to stay at home, don't forget to let your boss and your colleagues know so they won't be surprised by your absence the next day.
Freezing, chuckling, phone
You're getting into your job, but your coworkers are laughing at you, and you're being brutally ripped out of it?
Did you become, unwittingly, a witness to a phone conversation you'd better not listen to?
Do not disturb your colleagues with huddling, singing, talking aloud (which you lead over their heads), footbeat, blunt words or discontent expressed aloud.
They can disturb even if your colleagues are not immersed in a project (writing, design, organization).
Are you accusing the others of a mistake?
If your work is not done by the time set, you forget to send a mail or an important message, don't accuse anyone of this oblivion!
Do not put it on the account of any chaos in the office or your noisy colleagues!
Recognize it if you've made a mistake and if it's had inconveniences for others, fix it!
Ask how you can fix your fault, fix your negligence!
Do you feel too much at home at the office?
Putting a jogging and slippers is comfortable at home but they are not suitable at the office!
Do not wear comfortable jogging even if your function allows it!
Do not be neglected, respect yourself and your colleagues by getting dressed properly, and if your function requires it by wearing beautiful and elegant clothes, to go to work!
If you want to meet expectations, you're no longer interesting.
We're moving slowly into the usual morning cork.
Suddenly, a particular melody is heard on the radio: the voice of a violin with electronic effects.
I'm putting up the sound.
The music changes its rhythm and the bass arrives to accompany the tones all the time, then a female choir comes to join it like a real jewel.
Mr2 broadcasts Zagar's Wings of Love song.
Hungarian musical life has not spoiled us for a long time with a good-quality electronic pop.
Now it seems that the plug becomes different if you listen to Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, the few interesting new productions born of the Hungarian digital underground gradually begin to change the overall image and, despite the new mode of garage rock tearing the guitar, the Hungarian electropop proves that there is new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer arrived from Pécs and he played himself in the Yonderboi group before he started his own way, perhaps because "there is no room for two feet in the same shoe."
His project (Zagar) and his music, an alloy of jazz, electronic dance music and pop, began to make themselves known when he was entrusted with the composition of the soundtracks filmed (e.g.,
The Ferenc Török season).
The formation initially played in small clubs began to be known by a wider audience when the magazine wan2 cited their first album of 2002 among the fifty largest records on the Hungarian market and proclaimed Zagar, along with Yonderboi, the almost only creators of the Hungarian trend who would be equally competitive in the west.
Zagar and his ensemble have undoubtedly become "trendy" but no one has asked them if they want to wear this label.
The band reacted properly, released a new and better record.
The recently released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open new paths for them, although the title wishes to represent a continuity with the years spent at Pécs.
It was a line from Balázs Zságer's former group of Pecs.
We are there with the reference to flight but next to aerial music now appears, according to the spirit and trend of the time, the stronger guitar, impact of rock and roll.
György Ligeti, singer currently working in England with The Puzzle, showed his talent in these songs during the debut of the album at the Millennium Park.
On the album, we find a real radio tube, mr2 Petõfi, recently broadcasting popular music from morning to evening, began to introduce the melodies of Wings of Love recorded with six Hungarian singers ("Underground Divas").
So it's all right (?).
hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer questions.
hvg.hu: This new tube prompts me to ask a question: has your music remained a music aimed at a certain layer?
Zságer Balázs: The term music aimed at a certain layer does not tell me much.
For me there are two castes in light music; not mainstream or underground, not alternative or pop but commercial and sincere music.
The so-called alternative, underground music can also be mediocre and made only for sale and thus become commercial.
Now, a good pop song can be sincere too.
The attitude of reception also works in this spirit regardless of language or borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference between Hungarian and foreign audiences, is either one more open to your music?
Zs.B.: Outside, especially in the west, light music has older traditions.
There, people go to concerts and not only young people of about ten or twenty years old, but also the older ones.
They follow with much more attention the changes in light music as they think it is also part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the public in your work?
Are you interested in who, or how many people listen to your music?
Zs.B.: I'm obviously glad to see that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
However we have never made music for the market.
For us the music is not made to achieve a goal but for a specific reason.
The role of the public is more important at concerts or mutual influence is already working, but it is only perceived in the elusive changes of the moment.
Now, I've noticed that if you want to meet the public's expectations, you won't be interesting anymore.
hvg.hu: Will you follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and has a career in the west.
Zs.B.: We don't really follow his path even if sometimes some try to find traces in our music.
We are rather team players who trust each other's musical presence and let it deploy.
At first, it was inevitable that our music should be compared to Yonderboi's music because there are many of us who leave his band and take another path.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love takes first place on mr2 Petõfi's list.
Many heard the name of Zagar for the first time through this song.
With this more popular style you consciously opened up to a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't plan to make a tube to sell the disc.
This song means more things.
We wanted it for the final of the album to try to soften the sound orgy and the more difficult themes addressed throughout the album.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why them - what was the guideline?
Zs.B.: The idea was to have a choir of the gospel genre.
We had the idea of composing this choir of good soloists from the Hungarian music scene.
Thus was composed the six-member choir, namely Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh, which was then called Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you want this song like that or did the girls change it a little?
Zs.B.: This song already existed for a long time in an instrumental version and then when we composed the album, we thought there was still something missing from this song.
The sequel of chords attracted the voice of the song.
I sang the same night the melody that the girls learned later.
I got it almost immediately and everything was terribly spontaneous.
I remember it galvanized me back then, but sure we needed the Divas.
With my voice she wouldn't have had the same strength.
hvg.hu: On the record and also at the concert it seemed to me that the girls were in the background.
There is no solo (except for a short solo by Judy Jay), they don't have a role alone, they all sing together and they don't sing louder than music, so music doesn't just accompany their song.
They were behind the stage, too.
Is that what you want?
Zs.B.: The fact that they were in the background is due only to technical problems.
On the other hand, what was voluntary was that we did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also says we have to forget our ego a little, forget who comes from where, who goes or, we just have to let those wings, the wings of love, take us away.
I wanted others to feel the euphoric state that we felt when the song was born.
hvg.hu: Which of the songs made you work the most?
Zs.B.: Actually, no one in the music creation process had any more difficult songs when mixing.
For example, with Dorian Gray's Dilemma, or I play a concert piano, or with Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, or the groove didn't want to work for long, and then, little by little, everything set up like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What's your favorite on the new album?
Zs.B.: It changes all the time with the concerts and the fact that I already "dropped" this record.
Right now, they're Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
The perfidious trader risked billions because of his inferiority complex
A concealing fraudster.
His former employee was the French giant Société Générale, owner of the Czech bank Komerční banka.
The bank lost almost five billion euros because of him.
Instead, it seems that Kerviel is only a great player who wanted to match his colleagues, and who, moreover, cannot be regarded as incapable.
Unlike all large bank houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's fragile," his superiors said, who reported him to the police.
However, based on Kerviel's statement from the French media, including Le Monde, his transactions generated a profit of €1.6 billion at the end of last year.
The crisis surpasses the United States
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he says in the statement.
Last summer, he managed to take advantage of the US crisis to earn half a billion euros.
In fact, he felt the opportunity from the beginning of the year.
Information began to emerge in February that so-called sub-prime mortgages, granted to low-income clients or those who had experienced repayment difficulties in the past, would have problems.
But this crisis should not affect the economy as a whole.
Kerviel didn't believe it, and he made a good bet.
Thus, at the end of the year, its profits amounted to €1.6 billion.
"As soon as I won my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel says, adding that he didn't, of course, keep anything for himself. "
In all the interrogation, he confesses to have distorted the reports so as not to be detected.
He managed to fool his superiors, although the Eurex stock exchange began to take an interest in his transactions.
Who is safe has nothing.
Was he afraid of being discovered?
No, I'm not.
"I thought just getting $1.6 billion for the bank was going to satisfy them."
Where does he want to risk so much?
He only got to his post gradually.
He had started working at the Société Générale in 2000 just after completing his studies at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant trader and, in 2005, he became an independent trader with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
"From my first interview in 2005, I knew that I was much less regarded than the others.
In the light of my university curriculum and my professional and personal career, "Kerviel told investigators.
Soon after taking office, he won his first great success.
Thanks to the Allianz actions, it gained half a billion euros by capitalising on the decline of this title during the attacks in Londrès.
And the mechanism was triggered - he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll leave you in peace.
"There was like a snowball effect," he told the police.
But the superiors knew everything, or rather, they knew it.
"As long as I won, they were pretending to close their eyes."
This is when the beginning of the year comes.
He loses a billion euros in one day.
In mid-January, after the weekend, he decided to hide the sum.
On Monday, when he arrives at work, he is no longer employed by the bank.
A few days later, the bank announced that it had lost 5 billion euros because of him.
And how did we find out?
He became a suspect because of his leave of absence.
"Last year, I only took four days off.
A trader who does not take a vacation is a trader who does not want to leave his book to another, "concludes Kerviel.
The Czech Republic has the opportunity to obtain 365 billion
Yesterday, the ministers of the Czech Government signed a total of nine operational programmes with representatives of the European Commission, who could, in the coming years, bring EUR 14 billion (around CZK 365 billion) to the Czech Republic.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can get from Brussels in the years 2007 to 2013.
Nearly DKr 125 billion from seven operational programmes will be allocated to the Czech regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around DKr 100 billion under the Enterprise and Innovation programme.
The transport sector will receive the largest share, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the most important operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the financial resources that Czech Republic can obtain under these projects.
This money will lead to an increase in the budget of the National Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year a sum of 90.8 billion kroons.
The Enterprise and Innovation programme, aimed at SMEs and entrepreneurs, should be used to obtain financial resources to encourage innovation within the company.
Companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies, research in industry, but also for the introduction of new and more effective management methods.
Until now, Czech Republic has been one of the least successful beneficiaries of EU funds among the new members.
The Tribunal confirmed the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former President of Nicaragua
The Court of Appeal of Nicaragua confirmed Thursday the sentence of 20 years in prison for the former president of the country Arnold Alemán, to whom he was sentenced in 2003 for a fraud of 100 million dollars (almost 1.8 billion crowns).
He was later released and lived under house arrest in his hacienda near the capital of Nicaragua.
Whether or not the former head of this Central American state, in office between 1997 and 2002, will be reincarcerated is currently unclear, according to the AP agency.
According to Court of Appeal President Ileana Pérez, everything will now depend on prison officers, either they will let Aleman finish his sentence at home, or they will go back to prison.
Four years ago, the Tribunal proved that Alemán regularly moved government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
They were fictitious companies and the accounts actually belonged to his family members and his closest supporters.
Some of this money went into the funds that Alemán had created to finance his election campaign in 2001.
The budget has been adopted.
That's how it is.
The State budget has been adopted.
How is this budget exceptional?
This is the first budget designed by this government and accepted by the majority government without the support of the opposition.
The one for the current year was passed a year ago thanks to the support of the Czech Socialist Party - ČSSD, since it was Minister Sobotka who prepared it and ČSSD could not afford to refuse it.
Unlike the restless debate before the vote on the declaration of distrust to the government, this time nothing dramatic.
The Chamber of Deputies has adopted this law without any problems, which, although the most influential, is usually neglected.
That's a kind of paradox.
Whether you like it or not, each chapter and article is the beginning and end of any government.
The budget is a constituent part of politics, though hidden behind the power competition between government and opposition.
The latter is more attractive in the media, and that is why it is given more attention in the media.
The arguments of politicians are much more of an interest to the public than to the abrupt figures.
The national budgets of the past socialist governments suffered from three evils that the current budget is not capable of settling at the same time:
The first is the large share granted to the costs of statutory mandates, consisting not only of pensions, but also of social security contributions, adopted last year by the silent "coalition" of ČSSD and KSČM parties.
The second is a deficit economy, as a result of the first evil.
The third obstacle is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of cities and municipalities.
However, it is not the deficit of the state budget that is the greatest risk.
It is public and relatively under control.
The real time bomb is the deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors often issued, in stunned terms, bonds, excessively indebted to their municipalities, in order to obtain, apart from money from taxes, tax duties and bank loans, new sources of investment.
In past years, they managed to repay these debts through the mass sale of shares in distribution systems, particularly energy, obtained from the State in the context of privatizations.
Today, they no longer have that source.
Based solely on official and verifiable facts, it can be seen that:
Our economy, like the rest of the world, has already been going through a phase of growth for several years, and ČSSD is certainly looking forward to it.
It was a unique opportunity for successive party governments to regularize public finances.
Instead, they were surrendering the state more and more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania and Egypt, have managed their affairs in a much more reasonable way than our republic.
It is a monstrous shame that falls primarily on previous governments.
We are among the countries that, on a global scale, are least threatened by poverty.
We therefore do not need massive social programmes which have unfortunately been unnecessarily swollen in recent years.
Although some of the absurd populist spending, approved last year before the elections, has been eliminated, if a shift in the age limit for retirement, as well as a reform of the pension system, is not forthcoming, then any policy will cease to exist in that country and anyone in power will only administer it.
By barely exaggerating, it can be said that the politicians in power will become bureaucrats mechanically distributing the majority of the money imposed between pensions and social benefits.
That is why the current budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the mechanism whereby ordinary costs are pushed back by the costs of mandates.
The projected deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary if previous governments had not dissipated all the money they could.
If we really do not want the policies in power to become mere bureaucrats, we must be patient and give this fragile government coalition, aware that the state can only spend the equivalent of what it can take on taxes and tax duties, the calmness necessary for the preparation of new reform laws.
Only the latter will enable a balanced State budget to be gradually achieved.

Banks want to settle the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the English, Swiss and Canadian central banks have decided to fight the financial market crisis together.
More than a hundred billion dollars will thus be placed on the money markets through auctions.
It will be for banks to sell, through an auction system, the interest rates at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the US Fed will auction $40 billion and, in addition, will provide $24 billion to the European and Swiss Central Banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have decided to take such concerted action to prevent or even reduce the effects of the financial crisis.
"This approach tends to address the major problems of the economy, namely the growing lack of free capital that banks could lend," wrote his report to Bernard Baumohl customers of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group.
"The concerted action of the Central Banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to about 50 percent," Baumohl adds in his report.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are still waiting for billions of more losses.
"The central banks have chosen this approach because they must really understand what can still follow," says ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he adds.
Central banks fear that, if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will lend more to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and plunge the US economy into a recession that could affect global economic growth.
The central banks made this choice after the failure to reduce Londrès' interbank rate, known as LIBOR, used to borrow on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still afraid of mutual borrowing, despite the fact that the U.S., Canadian and English central banks had repeatedly declined their interest rates in the fall.
"This will have the same effect as a further fall in interest rates," said Reuters Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some analysts do not believe that the Central Bank approach will help to stem the crisis, as it does not address the main problem of the fall in the US housing market.
President Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to be particularly harmful to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again spoke on the issue of global warming.
This time, criticism was levelled at the United Nations international conference on climate change ending in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not Green, he stated that the debates of environmentalists were incredible.
According to Klaus, it is not only the structure of the conference, made up of a curious mix of representatives of Governments and non-governmental organizations, that is unacceptable, but also the basic difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and the reality.
"The debate is not structured at all, it is just a rocket of words, ersatz solutions to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed, when presenting his book, that his subject is of great importance to him and that is why he is so committed to this cause.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book also appeared in German translation, since, he said, "I often meet only the caricature of my opinions."
From now on, interested persons can read its positions without being distorted.
Klaus recalled that although he was not a climatologist, he nevertheless felt that he had enough arrangements to write such a book.
He is indeed an academician capable of monitoring and appreciating scientific treaties, he has the practice of statistics and he is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are, according to him, the following: the climate is constantly changing, the changes in the climate are therefore normal, there is not a shared opinion on global warming, the effects of the current changes are neither too great nor too serious, they represent no danger, and, lastly, efforts to influence climate change are unnecessary, ineffective and unacceptably costly.
Especially since he had the experience of a totalitarian regime, he considered it unacceptable to impose invitational opinions on others, which he felt to be a dangerous attack on freedom.
In response to the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable protection of the environment, but against fundamentalist environmentalism that does not take into account the relationship between the costs and the profit they bring."
In Vienna, Klaus had already talked about this two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600 thousand people failed to renew their driving licence in time
Six hundred thousand drivers allowed the deadline to expire and failed to renew their old driving licence, which expires at the end of the year.
We are the last day that people can still ask for renewal, so that the authorities will be able to issue them a new permit before the end of the year.
However, the Department is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers without a valid licence will take the road.
According to the authorities, they have not renewed their driving licence, especially those who no longer wish to drive.
While municipalities are reporting a drop in the number of licence renewal applications, authorities in the capital are overflowing with applications and the number of licence renewal applications has increased this week.
The Town Hall is satisfied with about 2000 customers per day.
There's a half-hour tail about.
In Prague, nearly 140,000 drivers have not yet renewed their driving licences.
It takes 20 days to issue a new permit.
But it is possible to apply for delivery within five days.
In this case, the driver pays a surcharge of five hundred crowns.
Vehicle drivers who fail to carry out the mandatory renewal of the driver's licence by the end of the year and take the road without a valid licence will be liable, as of January, to a fine.
The culprit will be forced to pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the police officer may also deal with the offence by using a friendly approach.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine increases to CZK 2500.
According to old information, was liable to a fine even a person who was not going to travel.
In so doing she could be forced to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry had called on the authorities to moderate and impose fines of up to 1,000 kroons.
According to the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one risks fines in tens of thousands.
The driver's licence is, in his view, a document that people can decide whether they want to have it or not.
It is not like with the ID card that it must be valid without exception.
People who no longer wish to drive should surrender their driving licence.
Just bring it or send it to the corresponding municipality.
Driving licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid at the end of the year.
However, vehicle drivers are also being forced to gradually renew other types of driving licences.
Persons with records from 1994 to 2000 still have three years to complete the renewal.
The validity of driving licences issued in the years 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million other documents.
The Tribunal reduced the penalties of the detectives paced with Berdych
Josef Opava and Petr Kořařík, former police officers accused of connivance with David Berdych's gang, will serve 13 and 10 years respectively in prison.
The Prague High Court thus condemned them definitively by reducing their sentences by one year and two years respectively.
Initially, detectives of the Department for Combating Organized Crime were facing sentences of 14 and 12 years in prison.
It is no longer possible to appeal against today's judgement, only an appeal to the Superior Court is possible.
Although Berdych is also accused in this case, he is currently awaiting only the first instance verdict.
However, he has already received sentences in other trials for more than 16 years in prison.
He can't get any more.
In January, the Tribunal départemental convicted 19 persons for participation in hold-ups, and the Tribunal supérieure now dealt with the appeal interjections of 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have been questioning the charge since the beginning of the investigation, claiming that it was a manipulated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Court of Justice, the members of the police, after an agreement among others with Berdych, transmitted information from police sources to the criminals, covered the various hold-ups and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang paid 30 per cent of the larceny to Opava and Kořařík.
The prosecution refers to the criminal activity of the gang in the years 1999 to 2001.
Essentially armed robberies whose victims have, in most cases, suffered serious damage to their health, but also the abuse of power by a public official and outlawed weaponry.
During the house searches, the police discovered illegally held pistols, shells with a steel core, a laser direct-fire viewfinder or a machine gun.
According to the charges, the gang has enriched itself with tens of millions of crowns.
Apart from about 20 men in this trial, the courts have already found Berdych and a whole range of other people guilty of other robbery.
Other men in the Berdych neighbourhood are still explaining themselves to the court in another trial, some cases have not yet reached the court.
For the time being, the main hearing has avoided Tomáš Přta and Maroš Šulej who are currently in detention in Ireland, where they are awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
The price of substitution for children: 12 million
The lawyer of the affected families Igor Veleba wants to obtain from the hospital of Třebíč a compensation of 12 million crowns plus the costs.
Three million for each mother, two million for fathers and one million for each child.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
That is why the lawyer at the Ondřej Dostál hospital does not agree at all with Veleba's proposal.
"We refuse such a claim, it is very high," Dostál said at the end of the hearing.
"To be able to form an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need the expert report, which the opposing party has commissioned.
We'll check if this one has any explanatory value.
But we continue to believe that the total sum should not exceed hundreds of thousands, "Dostál stressed.
According to him, the amount should be fixed between 100,000 and 200,000 Kč for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, Jablov's family demanded a million crowns for every month she could not raise her biological daughter.
Veleba used the expert report, prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague-Motol, as a supporting document for the compensation negotiations.
According to experts in psychology and psychiatry, parents suffered psychological damage and were subject to stress at different scales and depths.
The stress situation has been better supported by men, although they have been faced with remorse for not preventing the substitution of newborns.
Women, however, remain less serene in the face of the experience of trauma in the current situation and in the face of what is happening at the moment, summed up the contents of the Veleba report.
Veronika and Nikola were replaced by nurses at Třebíč Hospital on 9 December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to Čermák in Přibyslavice and Veronika to Libor Brož and Jarosha Trojanová in Jablozov.
At the end of October, the governor of the region Vysočina Miloš Vystrčil gave each of the families 100,000 crowns for the reimbursement of the expenses caused by the error of the Třebíč hospital managed by the region.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally obliged to take out civil liability insurance.
In the event of default, they must draw on the reserve fund, exceptionally, they may request assistance from the manager.
Up to now, the courts have recognized relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated on the basis of the tables were in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions.
Polívka lost Valašské Království (the Kingdom of Valašsko)
Bolek Polívka lost the dispute over the mark Valašské království (Kingdom of Valašsko).
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, it was he who used the title King of Valašsko for the first time, but the project was set up by the team around Tomáš Harabiš, former collaborator of the actor.
Polívka was not present at today's hearing.
According to his lawyer, the case is probably not over and his client will appeal.
"The dispute concerns the fact that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasitizing the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said Polívka's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, the words Kingdom of Valašsko evoke to everyone precisely this actor and comedy.
Harabiš is of the same opinion.
"There's almost a ten-year job behind us.
The search for money and the development of events, "he said.
According to him, money is the cause of the dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project is successful and that they could benefit from it.
It is they who want to parasite on our work, "he added.
A lucrative business
According to the court, Polívka used for the first time the title valašský král (King of Valašsko) in its television programme.
Actor Radoslav Brzobohatý crowned him king in 1993.
At the time, however, this had no bearing on the plan to create a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš came with the idea of issuing passports of the Valašské Království.
From a humorous action originally, a lucrative business and commercial activity emerged, followed by the creation, by Harabiš, of the company Valašské království.
In 1997 Polívka agreed that his name and signature should be mentioned in the passport and even offered to the holders sales on the price of the visit to his farm and his theatre performances.
Who's gonna sit on the throne?
Today, the judge also mentioned that Harabiš only used the naked idea, published by Polívka in the Manéž show, for commercial purposes.
"The popularity of Boleslav Polívka certainly helped the Valašské království project," said the judge.
She added, however, that the soul of the project was made up of Harabiš and his team, who devoted themselves to the project intensively.
The collaboration between the parties now enemies continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized for Polívka an official coronation in Vsetín.
But from then on, conflicts began to accumulate between Polívka and Harabiš, culminating in the deposition "of King Boleslav the first elected for ever."
The leading role in the kingdom was then, under the inspiration of Harabiš, assumed by singer Jarmila Šuláková as Queen Mother.
Then, in 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Harabiš and his company, which the court today rejected.
What could make the case clear is the intended tournament for the throne and half the princess.
He should get a new king out of it.
He didn't want to betray the details and date yet.
"We don't want to go to work fast.
That would be something like the kings' parade in Slovácko.
The king would be elected for a while.
Even Mr Polívka can of course register, "added Harabiš.
Test of the Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearance of prejudices
Actually, I've never been a big fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its rolling qualities were nothing extraordinary, and the quality of speed change, driving and also manufacturing could in many respects be described as below average.
At present, however, there is its successor on the market, Peugeot 207, which is much better.
All the more so as the combi named SW goes one step further, all I have left is to think better.
When I tested the classic hatchback of the Peugeot 207 I complained for example about the space for the head on the back seats.
While there the complaints are over because the combi bodywork means that even the great devils will be at ease in this regard.
Let's take a quick look.
I'm going to talk very quickly about the inside so I don't repeat myself too much.
This is a fairly successful design, my only comment on the central tunnel that I think is poor.
Now, I would have liked a slightly more inventive design, given that the car looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and the time when we could complain about seats or files too short is over.
Lateral guidance has also improved significantly compared to model 206.
As for space, the increase in the dimensions of the bodywork is noticeable here too.
The combi also sees the lack of space above the mentioned head disappear.
A safe in the safe
The most important thing about this vehicle is its luggage compartment.
I have to assess this as very well accessible (also thanks to the rear swivel ice) and a rather easy stowage.
Blind spaces are equipped with stopping elastics that are an ideal compromise.
It is not bulky and can be extended while being able to hold fairly heavy objects.
But let's stop at the volume.
According to the tables, this makes 428 l in the basic configuration, which is a rather average figure compared to competition.
Apart from Škoda Fabia Combi, the best-selling vehicle in this category in the Czech Republic.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of Mlada Boleslav's product, we see that the Peugeot remains very significantly behind, the difference being 52 liters.
When it comes to leaving abroad or loading a stroller, this figure is almost critical.
But, if I were to highlight the advantages, I would mention the bottom of the body left after the backrest of the back seats perfectly straight, or a very low step.
120 horsepower distributed over four cylinders
The car we tested was equipped with a four-cylinder Otto engine with a volume of 1.6 l and a power of 88 kW.
And actually, that's what a 1.6 should look like that makes a family hatchback work.
It is silent, consumes little and, above all, it grows well.
If I compare it with the equivalent produced by Škoda which often gives the impression of having an exhaust pipe plugged by a mop, then I can only be enthusiastic about it.
Let's go through the tariffs
The price of the vehicle is not affordable by all.
However, we must be aware that we have tested a fairly well equipped car, with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a vehicle with a 1,4 litre Otto engine amounting to 329,900 Kč is still fair.
The vehicle we tested costs from 410 900 Kč, which is already enough.
Premium equipment, also tested, increases the price by 80,000 Kč.
In addition to head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic windscreen wipers, automatic rear window control...
In fact, the vehicle ultimately costs 531,900 Kč.
This is a lot, but try to add the extra equipment to the Fabia price and you will get a very similar figure.
All that remains to be done is to choose the brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not working well
The number of children from Eastern European countries in British schools is increasing, raising concerns among the remaining children about the evolution of local education.
For the time being, the integration of Eastern Europeans faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even see cases where conflicts between immigrants and descendants of the original inhabitants turn into violence.
The case of Northern Kent, where opposition conflicts are beginning to escalate and immigrants of Slovak origin are clearly illustrating the problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe.
The quarrels, the chicane and the fights between the students have been reflected in the relationships between the parents.
The situation went so far that the police arrested in Chatham a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with an iron bar.
The culprit defends herself by claiming that the boy insulted her with racist remarks.
The police also had to intervene in the attack on a Slovak immigrant by two teenage girls.
The girls allegedly made racist remarks to the man and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a young man climbed on the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he answered with apples and pears and then he discovered his butt, "described another unpleasant adventure a mother of Slovak students.
Complaints are made by both parties.
One of the remaining people went so far as to call conflicts with immigrants a struggle for survival.
The cases mentioned above show that the atmosphere in British schools between native inhabitants and immigrants is beginning to be tense.
70 thousand Slovaks who have come to find work are registered in Great Britain.
And about 30,000 Slovak students attend British schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, this is really an island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your leave can happen if you make a good choice.
Golden and white beaches like snow, high waves or a calm sea like a pond.
Palm and all inclusive with servers offering you on the beach pizza, ice cream or intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean Sea, you will not find this list in its entirety, but enriched.
But there is only one island on which you will find much more and it is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful island in the Greater Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba had been the bastion of their invasion of America.
Christopher Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became the repository and trans-shipment of the treasures that the Spaniards had stolen and were transporting to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional was built in the early 1920s.
Lucky Luciano, one of the leaders of the American mob, built it, since everything that was a crime in the USA (especially under prohibition) was admitted and supported in Cuba: drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his clients were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, tall buildings grew and cars, belonging to the cult symbols of the 1950s of the last century, were circulating on the broad boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojímar he had his yacht.
Show business stars and politicians from all over America left their signatures on the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio.
So what about today?
You can leave your autograph on the walls of Havana's Bodeguita.
In the bar of Hotel Nacional, a luxury hotel, you will be mixed up with the cocktail of your choice.
And these cult cars still circulate in Havana, since the jigoulis and the fiats once imported have already for a long time, in a climate so salty and wet, rotten.
Although Havana, especially the oldest part, is noticeably declining, nowhere else in the vicinity is there as many splendid colonial monuments as there are precisely there.
Other places become more beautiful, for example Trinidad.
Since tourism brings the money if necessary, its development has the green light.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varader, on the coast of the Holguín province, and also on small islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a fantasy that is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by those who love small trains.
The cane had returned from the plantations in sugar mills on a narrow track by small steam and motor trains.
Their rolling stock has not been renewed for decades, and this is how small locomotives, whose contemporaries are not only in museums, can be seen on the move.
Where to direct his steps?
The majority of visitors do not miss the most well-known places.
So there is no need to write a lot about Varadero or Havana.
Otherwise remember that in Hemingway's property, already mentioned, there is a museum and that whoever loves this writer should not miss the visit.
One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Víñales valley to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation grows on limestone soil.
Mogotes, calcareous balloons and rocks rise in candlelight from the bottom of the valley, and, with fertile earth caught in their entrails, even its rotten rocks are covered with a very dense plant carpet.
The valley is the place where Cuban tobacco of the highest quality is probably grown.
You can meet the final shape of this product if you visit one of Havana's cigar factories.
Someone may also find it interesting that this is where Major Zeman's Chilean episode was shot.
Trinidad
Old town founded shortly after the Spaniards colonized the island.
It was the market for slaves and sugar that brought him glory and wealth.
Wealth has been embodied in the beauty and showcase-city character of this small city.
Koloniální španělská architektura, výraznė ovlivněná pozdějšími francouzskými osadníky, se za čtyři staletí ffíě, nezměnila.
Trinidad, located between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a remote place that still in the 1950s of the last century, there was no road that would connect this region with the rest of the country.
This isolation allowed him to stay away.
We didn't build anything, and that's why we didn't demolish anything either, everyone just had a roof over their heads.
If you have more time than an afternoon in Trinidad, then it is also worth seeing interesting places in the vicinity, such as Playa Ancón Beach or the Valley of Sugar.
Then, in the evening, it is customary to go to the Casa de la Música, which is animated after sunset and where the music only deafens in the early morning.
Baracoa
Some call this village in the extreme east of Cuba the most beautiful on the island.
This view is certainly already influenced by the path that leads to it.
The two roads leading from Guantánamo must cross high and rugged mountains and cross a landscape almost without marks of human activity.
UNESCO has placed Cuba's eastern patch, thanks to its unspoilt landscape, on the list of world heritage.
The best chocolate is made in the church, there is the cross of Christopher Columbus (in fact, it was born about a hundred years after Columbus's journey) and from the hill where the old castle-fort and the present hotel El Castillo are held, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain massif, the Bay of Sows and the island Isla de Pinos, the Tropicana cabaret, the shrine of the patron saint of Cuba Caridad del Cobre, Santeria, African religions practiced by the descendants of the former slaves, about all this a quantity of pages could be filled.
Only, as they say, it's better to see once.
In Afghanistan, allies are passive, say Americans
The lack of troops and necessary equipment, according to the United States, affects the conduct of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defence Minister Robert Gates, NATO should outline a concrete plan for the years to come.
The mission to Afghanistan is not proceeding as it should, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, representatives of countries that have troops in the southern part of the country.
In addition to the growing opposition on the part of the Taliban movement, the eight states involved are now also discussing future plans and the coordination of allies.
While the United States has called this week through Defence Minister Robert Gates for NATO troops to become more active, Britain has given priority to strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and stepping up development assistance.
"Developments in Afghanistan are perceptible, but military power can only be part of the solution.
The other being to allow the inhabitants to start a new development of the economy and security themselves, "said the British defense minister Des Browne to the BBC channel.
Ninety per cent
Afghan insurgent activity is, according to US military data, the most intense in the last five years.
The number of violent actions has increased by 27 per cent compared to last year, up to 60 per cent in the southern Helmand province.
NATO countries have about 40 thousand troops in Afghanistan, almost a quarter of them in the south.
Yet, according to the United States, the allies have reached their absolute limits in the organization and equipment of the troops.
Specifically, they are requesting additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
"We will have to think seriously about the concrete goals for the coming period, as well as how to achieve them," Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop made similar remarks today.
"I am not happy with what we have on land and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we would need, and that's not enough, "said De Hoop to Reuters Agency at the end of the three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
The past few months have also been a time of conflict between the countries involved in the issue if all the allies are actually doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large representation in Afghanistan.
But they are engaged in areas where violence is minimal, so the combat requirements they are subject to are not as stringent as those in the southern and eastern parts of the country where we operate, "said Gates.
The British tabloid Sun described the German soldiers as lazy this week.
"The Afghan lazy ones discovered: the Germans play, while ours fight," Sun wrote in a document supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper Bild went on to counter-attack by publishing a photo of a British troupe during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will rise to one trillion in 2009
The burden of a State debt in excess of 84,000 kroons is on each Czech.
Total debt rose at the end of September to DKr 842.7 billion.
This year, the government planned to borrow DKr 159.2 billion.
As a result of better-than-expected changes in government budget savings, the Ministry has reduced the projected amount to DKr 152.8 billion.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose towards the end of September to DKr 842.7 billion.
During the nine months of this year it therefore increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
From June onwards, however, it decreased by SEK 13.4 billion.
Today, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on State debt dating back to early October.
Each Czech is responsible for a debt in excess of 84,000 kroons.
Over the past year, the State has owed more than DKr 111 billion.
"For the time being, it seems that with a smaller deficit planned for next year, the border could be crossed by only a trillion crowns in 2009.
Next year, the debt is expected to be between 900 billion and a trillion crowns, "said Patria Finance analyst David Marek for the iHNed.cz server.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikor's forecast is similar: "We could surpass the trillion in 2009.
The precise date will depend on the next budget that is not yet known.
If it appeared that the political situation was changing, that the policies were ready to save more, the date could be postponed to 2010.
But I am not waiting for this change, "he said.
Debts are growing
The state debt consists of the central government's debts and is generated mainly by the accumulation of deficits in the state budget.
The Government's debt is financed by treasury bills, annuity bonds, direct loans or, for example, by loans from the European Investment Bank.
The domestic debt of the State has increased for the time being from NOK 38.5 billion to NOK 719.4 billion.
The external debt of the State has increased this year for the time being from DKr 1.7 billion to DKr 123.3 billion.
The debt of the so-called negotiable State reached at the end of September 803.3 billion kroner and from June it decreased by 13.7 billion kroner.
The average debt liability of the State was 6.5 years.
"The total debt increased annually from the first to the third half of the year by 13 per cent, which is far too high, given the current good health of the economy.
It is interesting that the increase is generated mainly by annuity securities where it reaches 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing, but on the other hand it indicates that there will be something to negotiate when the pension reform comes, "commented Pikora data.
Better than we expected
As a result of the Government's 2007 debt financing and management strategy, the Government planned to borrow DKr 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of September, however, due to better-than-expected changes in government budget savings, the Ministry reduced the projected amount to DKr 152.8 billion.
The sum is essentially constituted by the deficit in the State budget, which will obviously reach SEK 76 billion this year, instead of the originally foreseen SEK 91.3 billion.
Secondly, these are the maximum sources for the Czech Consolidation Agency, namely SEK 13.3 billion, the reserve of SEK 10 billion for the payment of pensions, the financing of State annuities for SEK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank amounting to SEK 1.8 billion.
She was appearing before a court in Khartoum today for naming a teddy bear.
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday night by a Khartoum court to 15 days in prison and to deportation, his lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting students between the ages of 6 and 7 give the name Muhammad to a teddy bear when any representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
She was subject to a penalty of whiplash.
This 54-year-old British teacher at the Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at home and charged with Islam offences and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, following several complaints by parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually dates back to September, when this teacher asks her students, aged 6 / 7, to choose a name for the teddy bear of the class.
"Eight names come out of the mouths of the children, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed," says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in the class, 20 out of 23 children chose Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
The children then made a book for the class with the picture of the bear followed by the legend "My name is Mohamed."
The bear itself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem was simply that of the depiction of the prophet as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in the Sudan, said that he knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, "I just regret that she asked the children to vote for a name," he said, it was only an "innocent mistake."
Opinion shared by many of the teacher's students who describe her as "very attentive to her students" and "who never speaks of religion in class."
Remember that the first name Mohamed is also the middle name most given in Great Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honouring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, a question of interpretation.
They did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday at the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
Kosovo Serbs and Albanians completed a sixth and final discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without having been able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties were unable to reach a status agreement," said European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger at a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was "at stake," his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
"There is no immediate prospect of violence, but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
Termination of mediation on 10 December
The mediators of the troika, which includes the European Union, the United States and Russia, will visit Serbia and Kosovo one last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-speaking province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Kharchenko submit their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The discussions in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiating session since the troika was entrusted with a new mediation by the United Nations last August.
Americans and Europeans consider that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence to Kosovo in the Security Council, insist that negotiations continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," said Botsane-Kharchenko.
Unilateral Declaration of Independence?
After eight years of UN administration of Kosovo, Westerners believe that EU-supervised independence is the only viable solution.
Pristina stands ready to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not decide in its favour.
Belgrade insists on greater autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," announced the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these "last chance negotiations" have been taking place since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future Premier of the province, expressed his regret.
But he added that Belgrade's autonomy plan "belonged to a past that led to murders and deportations."
"Domino Effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic considered that a compromise was still possible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade said in particular that it feared a "domino effect" in a region still weakened by the wars of independence of the 1990s.
"For Serbia," he said, "this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should go exclusively to the Security Council, where its Russian ally had a veto right.
"The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," said Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica.
"These negotiations lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that "the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status," adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of the Albanians would be "in consultation" with the Westerners.
Bush breaks an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on Tuesday in Annapolis, Maryland, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations with a view to finding a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of the two men, Bush promised that he would do anything to help them conclude a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, Palestinians must dismantle "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end its settlement activities, Bush said, reminding both parties of their obligations under the "road map" for peace that they accepted in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas would aim "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including the core issues."
This name covers the three thorny problems at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now the State of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that the forthcoming negotiations be "comprehensive and thorough" and cover all aspects of a settlement, citing "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, settlements, water, security, among others."
In turn, Olmert stood on the rostrum and pledged that the upcoming talks would be "direct and continuous" and that "an effort would be made to complete them in the course of 2008."
Bush set the deadline at the end of 2008 for the implementation of his "vision of two co-existing Palestinian and Israeli states."
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had secured a commitment to that end from Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis was a success for Washington, was at the origin of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that offered Israel peace in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially as it addresses the root causes of the conflict and its central aspects," says Prince Saud in his interview with the Saudi-capitalized Arabic-language daily newspaper.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As in each of these various facts, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the Inspectorate General of the National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 5 p.m., at rue Louise-Michel, in Villiers-le-Bel.
"She was not in surgery but on patrol, and was travelling at 40-50 km / h, without a gyrophare," says a police source.
A green motorcycle of the Kawazaki brand, "not approved, therefore not allowed to travel on the public road" (see below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was circulating "very fast."
"She hit the police car on her left, after a priority refusal on the right," says a police officer.
The blood alcohol check on the vehicle occupants was negative.
The condition of the car (stoned front, starry windshield, torn bumper) reflects the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Given, announced that she had entrusted an investigation for "acts of manslaughter and non-assistance to anyone at risk" to the IGPN, co-seized with the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the IGPN investigation, at this stage, disqualified the responsibility of the police.
According to the magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, heard on Sunday night, confirmed "the police version, that this mini-motorcycle arrived relatively quickly on their left."
Yesterday, a kind of groove, probably caused by the friction of the foothold on the ground, showed that the two vehicles remained entangled while the police car managed to brake.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of the two victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, there was a rumor in Villiers-le-Bel that the police had left the scene very quickly, so they did not lend aid to the two young people.
The IGPN, while remaining cautious, would also rule out "any serious misconduct" with regard to this point.
"This is a more difficult aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation, on which we must be very careful," one police source said.
Liberation met an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows looking precisely at the stage.
"We went down right away, with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to revive them," says this witness.
There was nothing to do. "
He then saw "a completely haggard policeman, who was limping.
Two others tried to revive one of the young people, the fourth spoke on the telephone. "
In the face of the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and apparently the certainty that those present had of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police officers were taken by car by colleagues who arrived at the scene.
According to this witness, the rescue came "about twenty minutes after the police left."
They also performed cardiac massages in vain.
"I will not allow it to be said that the police have not provided assistance to young people.
These young people have been rescued.
The firefighters came in right away.
Everything has been done to try to save them, "stressed the prosecutor.
Tension is on the rise in Pakistan
On Monday, the Pakistani police repressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore in the east of the country, approximately 2,000 lawyers who were protesting against the state of emergency measures were injured by tear-gas grenades used by law enforcement officials, according to witnesses.
They responded by throwing stones, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested.
Scenarios similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and wounded lawyers.
Several were reportedly arrested.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations following a wave of some 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets giving access to the Supreme Court were blocked Monday morning to prevent the gathering.
Other demonstrations were reportedly held in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement received the support of the religious parties grouped together in the powerful alliance Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal whose president "urged the people to send flowers to the judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and detritus to those who took the oath before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promise no longer holds."
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the emergency measure proclaimed on Saturday night.
In the coming days, it was expected to decide on the legality of the presidential re-election of President Musharraf on 6 October, by indirect vote.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was ousted and replaced.
"Everything we see is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the Supreme Court's rulings," the magistrate told the newspaper The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president "no longer stands" after the state of emergency, said Deputy Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to abandon his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
In addition, the Pakistani government denied insistent rumours in the country that President Musharraf was under house arrest by his Deputy Chief of the Armed Forces.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unplanned births.
Even today, more than one in three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, reveals a study conducted by the Institut national d'études demographiques (Ined), forty years after the adoption of the Neuwirth law which liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as misplanned or unplanned births.
The different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterilizer still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, the Ined estimates.
Nevertheless, the liberalization of contraception has led to a better "fertility control," according to the Institute, which notes that the rate of use of the pill among women aged 20 to 44 has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Finally, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Voucher calculated to the nearest month for one in five couples and if possible in the spring, season considered the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It took more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew mates at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a ripped solar panel, essential for the station's scientific activities.
A risky exit that has accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from habitable modules, the speed with which it was imagined, tools "tinkered" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Tuesday when astronauts had unloaded the Harmony module from the Discovery Shuttle, a large cylindrical room that would soon accommodate the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a kind of dock for laboratory modules.
But we have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The crew's second task was to move a 17.5 tonne solar panel power generation module, already present on the ISS, to its final position.
After moving it, the crew began to redeploy the solar panels of the module, which have a wingspan of 76 metres.
And this is where one of the panels, which unfold like accordions, was damaged about a metre by a cable that got stuck.
Deployment was stopped to avoid further damage to the panel.
The astronauts, who were originally required to carry out a control exit from the Discovery Shuttle and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to go caracolar after 30 meters of the remote control arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalker of the Nasa.
Large, resistant, very clever, he has a very developed torso and long arms.
At 46 years of age, this training physician was therefore instructed to "operate" the solar panel "injured."
After accurately inspecting the damage, he severed the fault cable and installed some sort of "splints" on the damaged area.
He was helped by a second "spacewalker" left near the airlock and, from within, by other astronauts including Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, a mini-hockey cane wrapped in insulation to avoid electrocution on solar panels producing several hundred volts, was designed and "tinkered" by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was complete, Scott Parazynski waited until the panel was fully deployed before making an inventory of his tools and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts enjoyed half a day of relaxation before today, seven astronauts returned to the Discovery shuttle for a return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the stock exchange
The EADS action is currently falling sharply on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the Aeronautics and Defence Group announced that it will have to spend between €1.2 and €1.4 billion to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros currently on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group was obliged to review its forecast of operating income for 2007 as a result of the delays caused by the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which conditions the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost of offsetting the delay in the delivery of its military transport aircraft, announced in October, is "between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros, including over 1 billion for Airbus," announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
As a result of these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new operating income targets (EBIT) for 2007 when presenting its quarterly results next Thursday, he adds without further details.
The group also indicated that the estimate of new charges was consistent with the six-month delay.
As a reminder, EADS 'operating income fell by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges related to delays in another program, that of the very large carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of the A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
There will be no suspense on Sunday at the polls: the Russians will choose massively for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming their aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very closed campaign.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin today sends a television message to voters on public channels, which are already recorded but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as the leader of the united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory is going to be overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything go through by receiving foreign ambassadors, merely handing over a new charge against the West accused of interference - its favourite theme during the campaign.
"We know the price of true democracy and wish for honest, transparent and open elections, without hassle," he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, we are far from counting.
She denounces a campaign full of pressure.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziuganov said that "there have never been such dirty elections, even in the Yeltsin era."
After the crackdown on last weekend's protests, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal protest, remains forbidden to visit according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo soveticus"
Behind these non-suspense legislatures there are two much more open questions:
- Who will succeed Putin as president?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to make themselves known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot run for a third consecutive term.
But no successor emerges.
- What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Leader of the parliamentary majority and of the all-powerful united Russia party that would choose the government and the president?
In any case, in both legislative and presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have kept the mentality of homo sovieticus, they do not feel masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent Levada centre.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg goes back a long way: civil society lagged behind in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous community spirit delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin revived the paternalistic state model, perfectly accepted by the population, all the more so since this new paternalism was not followed by terror, but by some economic ease," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians "willingly renounce personal responsibility" which they had briefly shown after the break-up of the USSR.
"What's the point of thinking?"
The phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
And the administrative elite wants to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
In the name of which the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion by 54-year-old professor Tamara Cherednitchenko: "What is the point of thinking?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them? "
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which trace the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerite regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archival documents, stored over 27 km of linear in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were hitherto only available for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his successors.
The eleven States in charge of their management - including Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to researchers and historians.
The process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, and the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow research to be carried out "on the movements of prisoners, the population of the camps and the state of health of forced workers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, were opposed to the public opening up of these nominal documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the supposed homosexuality or mental handicap of some of the victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or arrest warrants drawn up by the Gestapo had been collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding civilians deported or subjected to compulsory labour and, possibly, providing proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees handle tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
"There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at Technische Universität Berlin in 2006.
EU and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath.
Last April, EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission their green light to enter into negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean). Indo-European bilateral trade is already close to €60 billion a year.
The EU is India's largest trading partner and accounts for 18% of its external trade.
The EU is also its largest foreign investor, but India is only the EU's 9th largest trading partner, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade pact will boost both economies enormously" and "India would improve its access to a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," justified Peter Mandelson.
Europe is the first or second market for each of India's top ten products, said the European Commissioner. Asian and European giants trade annually for "€47 billion in goods" and for "€10 billion in services," said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, regretting that bilateral trade has "not yet reached its potential." The EU and India meet Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering £10 billion over five weeks
The Bank of England expressed its concern on Thursday to ease the current return of concerns about credit conditions, and announced an offer of £10 billion at a basic rate of 5.75% over five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
"In order to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its planned reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of a five-week open market operation," she said in a press release.
The bank states that £10 billion (€14 billion) will thus be placed on the market on 6 December at 12.15 p.m. GMT, at the basic rate and until 10 January.
This is the first time that BoE appears to be putting cash on the market at five weeks in an open market operation.
These are normally done at a week's notice.
BoE adds in its press release that it "stands ready to take further steps to maintain interbank lending rates on a day-to-day basis with its base rate.
The day-to-day interbank rate was 5.829 per cent on Wednesday.
The three-month rate was 6.6 per cent, a higher rate since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the money put on the market by the Bank of England had had a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from using it.
According to some rumours, corroborated by the evolution of the price of the pound vis-à-vis the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums put on the market by the European Central Bank, at more advantageous rates and with more assured discretion.
UMP and NC refuse consideration of PS proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and New Centre groups refused on Thursday to discuss the articles of the Socialist draft law on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "niche" (a meeting initiated by a parliamentary group), the text contained some ten measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including the 50% increase in the premium for employment, the restoration of the floating TIPP, a transport cheque or the supervision of rents.
Since UMP and NC had voted against the articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting was adjourned following the general discussion, which had led to some lively exchanges between the majority and opposition at a few hours from Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on purchasing power.
MP leader PS Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent all of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending finance bill that the Assembly will consider next week.
A new festival is emerging
Following numerous rumors about the creation by C3 Presents of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in partnership with the UK producer Melvin Benn's Republic Festival.
"For our company, it is an honour to work with a person who has, no more or less, inspired the current movement of festivals in America," said Charlie Jones of C3 to Billboard.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer camping destination.
The festival is scheduled to take place August 8-10 on a 500-acre private farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts some 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to its portfolio and in 2006, Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Describing Glastonbury as the "most inspiring event" he has ever attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says that his company and Melvin Benn are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
"We chose Philadelphia as a market and worked assiduously with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
"We were in talks with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited by this project.
Unfortunately, we have become bogged down in politics because of the current administration, continues Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we were able to talk with Melvin Benn and we are about to create a superb festival on an exceptional site that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park in Chicago, after standing out in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
Both festivals are held in urban areas.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a country festival, while ours are taking place in urban green spaces," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, the two formulas to give both an impression of a country festival to the European and an urban festival to the American. "
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vineland, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but states that "they are interesting enough to invest in such an event and to host a festival that hopefully will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the capacity for this festival is "very great," like that of 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival at Tennessee.
He said that invitations had been issued to the groups, but that nothing could yet be confirmed when going to press.
"Vineland will be rock-flavoured, but the music will be varied, hoping to attract all sorts of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His C3 partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It's not easy to attract Hollywood movie trays to Montreal when no one but Terminator is opposed to it...
This seduction mission is one of the functions of delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions."
Is it hard to play in the hands of the Governor?
"You have to be careful, it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she will go.
Our role is to offer the ones they will judge best, "he says.
The race at the festivals
For the time being, however, the priority of Denis Turcotte is the promotion of cinema from here.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
It will be from all the festivals in the West Side, whether it is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, the question of presenting Quebec films, showcasing them and ensuring that directors make interviews.
The Dark Age had a beautiful showcase at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is featured in Santa Monica and will be featured at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a year-end rally on the stock market? Experts divided by the sub-prime crisis.
Less than five weeks from the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands hoping for the traditional year-end rally.
However, this year the experts are not as sure as this will happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December on the stock exchange generally has a positive attitude.
However, forecasts based exclusively on statistics should not be made, since, given the current context, uncertainties are likely in the markets, at least in the short term. "
Although they are not in favour of the stock exchange gaining momentum during the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market feeds on the existence of liquidity, ready to invest in view of the lack of guaranteed alternatives, especially fixed income, affected by the flight effect towards quality values in both long periods and short periods."
For this, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behaviour, not free of volatility "especially because we do not know the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates, given the high level of crude oil and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions"
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI's sales in Spain, agrees that this is not a good time to say that there will be a rally.
"It's not the best thing," says the expert.
Ibex, the Spanish stock market index, has lost nearly 4% since 8 November when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative view.
Intermoney analyst Juan Solana believes the Ibex 35 could close the year at 16,000 points thanks to the reorganisation of portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension schemes that occur every year during these dates.
However, the expert nuances that things will be a little different this year since he believes that the rally will take place from the second week of December, after the bridge of the Feast of the Constitution (December 6).
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect the market trend.
For its part, Federico Olucha, an analyst with Inversis Banco, assesses that we are close to technical levels and "that is why we could observe a rebound of the index that could be provoked according to the information coming from the European Union regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analyst hopes that these will be positive.
Analysts agree on the values that will be responsible for leading the Ibex to maximum new cottages.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year the great values are back for him."
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date approaches, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
While Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco assures that the increases will be due to the bank and the industrial sector.
The women builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, if they start there.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we hope that other constructors like Ferrovial and FCC will follow the same path," explains the expert.
Cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology companies will do so as well, although in this case there is not much representation on the Spanish market.
Five times for seven years
For the last seven years, only two occasions the month of December has been a month down.
The genuine year-end rally took place in 2003, during which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the breakthrough of the technological bubble.
This year, when the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of winnings (so far the Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and whether it manages to computer on its year-end rally.
The Banque Populaire will open 200 offices open 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
The Banque Populaire has decided to renovate a large part of its offices.
A total of 200 banks are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a major change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish organisations, since this is the first group that decided to start betting on the uninterrupted opening of its agencies until 8.30 pm, and to open Saturday from 10 am to 8.30 pm.
Another group that has also repeated several times that it would like to increase the schedules of its branches, BBVA, even though it has not yet decided to take the first step.
He is about to conclude an agreement with the unions to close 75% of his agencies on Saturday instead of opening an afternoon, but not to the public.
The results of the People's Bank's experience will be decisive if other bodies are to join this initiative, which coincides with business hours.
It is precisely this objective that the Banque Populaire is seeking.
Attract independent customers who travel in these areas to make their purchases in SMEs and shops on the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to open these 200 branches throughout Spain in about 18 months' time, as it is not about opening new branches but about renovating existing ones.
To this end, the organization will modernize its existing branches in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of customers on different streets.
In this way, the amplification of the schedules is accompanied by a different design from the inside of the branch and a new, more modern design with brighter colours.
The commercial bank manager, Ángel Rivera, assures that this renovation does not involve major investments, but the hiring of staff, since the number of employees will increase from six to eight or nine per agency.
The agencies, which will also have room for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
The Banque Populaire has already tested its initiative in three agencies in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, as Ángel Rivero explains.
The branches of Murillo Brave, O'Donnell and Gran Vía in Madrid are the streets to be chosen, and apparently with success, according to Rivero.
The Banque Populaire currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand of Mundocredit, specialized in the case of immigrants, also with very long hours, which open even on Sundays and public holidays.
In these agencies of PopularMax they will not copy the model of BBVA, where several of its agencies have a wide range of non-financial products for its sale.
"We don't want to compete with our customers," notes Rivero.
For the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles the stock market value of its rival Antena 3 for the first time
We've done it.
With this sentence Paolo Vasile, a Telecinco delegate, expressed yesterday his satisfaction, at the closing of the stock market, when he found that the channel he ran doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
A single aspect tarnished his joy: 'What hurts me is not the fact that we have increased more but that we have decreased less', he said.
However, he stressed that in a low market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished yesterday the day with a 2.54% increase.
This gain has stabilized its loss at 15.66% over the past year.
The stock exchange value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and announced by Vocento (13% more) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which gave in yesterday 1.52% and which has accumulated a fall of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other publicly traded comunication companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million in the case of Prisa (the publisher of Cinco Días) and 1.779 million in the case of Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenne 3 is due to the fact that we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact represents what we are able to do, in the same market, at what price and how we make it profitable in terms of audience '.
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become this year the first television channel to exceed the 1.000 million gross advertising revenues, as assured Giuseppe Tringali, the delegated advisor of Telecinco and Publispaña, the subsidiary that manages the advertising of the group.
In order for this announcement to be real, the television station would have to record an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing for the current fiscal year compared to 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, Antenne 3's net billing increased 1.6% in the first nine months of the fiscal year (up to 734.4 million), while TV's net revenues increased 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that the annalists point to for the best relative evolution of Telecinco on the Stock Exchange is the important pay out that it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarría distributed 100% of the profit between its shareholders.
Vasile ensures that, although it is early to make a decision, this ratio may vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol and in association with Mediaset.
We have the official compromise of giving for minimal 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, to those to whom we have already given securities with the 33% of Endemol '.
According to analysts, the market is currently showing signs of fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco in 2008 to 4% and in 2009 to 7%.
This is due, they explain, to the decline in projected revenue growth from 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and from 5.5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009.
The same company reduced Antenne 3's earnings forecast to 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
1.
Ibersecurities recommends purchasing both values based mainly on its high return on dividends and long-term sustainable potential.
2.
Caja Madrid sees Telecinco better (accumulate) than Antenne 3 (maintain) for 'multiple attractions' and business growth.
3.
JPMorgan: he recommends examining both cases since he had 'similar threats' (a saturated market and a poor economic climate).
Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
Parallel to its parliamentary formality, which ended today with the Congress's vote on amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the Government submitted to a public hearing the regulations that will develop the new law, with the objective of its entry into force before the year ends.
The representatives of the various groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members of Parliament and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulation to ensure investor protection and to regulate in detail the activities of the organizations so that markets would function effectively.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Law, involves the modernisation of the financial markets, as it strengthens investor protection, improves the powers of the leaders of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the various leaders of the European Union.
The new regulations will provide financial consulting services for specialized social reasons as well as for natural or legal persons and create a new type of financial services (ESIS), the financial consulting companies (AFIs), which merge with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it is increasing the number of systems for carrying out transactions on financial instruments, so that multilateral trading systems and order internationalization systems can be added to regulated secondary markets, which compete with existing stock exchange managers.
The Act also requires investment service companies to disclose on the market information on key aspects of its business profile, exposure to risk and forms of risk management, and requires them to keep a record of all transactions they conduct, to facilitate control by the NCVM.
In passing through the Congressional Committee on Economy, several changes have been added, including one that highlights that the debt securities will be considered as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which proved itself with what happened with the high-risk US mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, they took advantage of the transposition of the management took advantage to legally define the functions that graduates in Economics may be 30 years old after in 1977, was approved, the royal decree which defines the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate has incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the Ombudsman, who will work on behalf of a company, who will not require the permission of the CNMV and who will be able to lend its services of marketing products and attracting new customers to different investment companies at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index increased by five tenths in November, up to 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides a balance sheet on price developments in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) by providing data comparable in quality and time to those produced in the United States.
The leading indicator is calculated using the same method as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not yet available at the time of publication.
INE recalled that the information provided by the leading indicator is only indicative, because it does not have to coincide with the final data to be revealed on 14 December.
"The CPI will continue on relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and the Minister of Economy, Pedro Solbes, said that the 4.1% increase in the CPI in November is a "time figure," but at the same time he predicted that the price index will continue on "relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case Solbes has specified in the corridors of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential regarding monetary union continues to be "more or less" the same as in recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government was not facing such a high increase.
"We were hoping for a figure of around 4%," acknowledged the Minister of Economy in relation to the data announced today.
Virgin plans to recover with Northern Rock €42,000 million over three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen to more than 50% to £12,000 million (€16,800 million) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emerging loan with the Bank of England.
At that time he was raising some record deposits above £25,000 million, a figure that is gradually falling in two and a half months because of the mistrust of his clients and despite the 100% guarantee of that money that the Government has offered and that it will maintain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would rename the organization with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the revenues of British banks that will be deposited in the next three years to obtain the remaining £18,000 million until reaching the target of 30,000 million.
The group of magnate Richard Branson, known for his shameful advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its objective.
Northern Rock has named this week the Virgin Association's offer, in which three other companies participate, including its favorite to save it from bankruptcy.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for an alleged urban corruption scheme
The Civil Guard arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (of the Popular Party) because of his alleged relationship with the urban corruption scene discovered this week.
Moreover, one of the secretaries of the municipal council and the chief of police of the municipality were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced last May's Juan Morales, current member of the right, and until then city councillor of the town hall, who, according to the sources of the investigation consulted by the SER channel, could be the 'leader' of this frame.
Officers continue to search municipal and Urbanism Council premises and the possibility of further arrests in the next few hours is not ruled out.
In addition, Juan Morales' lawyer, the main suspect in the urban corruption scene, discovered earlier this week, was charged.
As indicated yesterday by the SER channel to the lawyer of the deputy 'of the People's Party' Juan Morales, he was arrested on leaving Morales's home with important documentation in his possession relating to the frame.
Moreover, according to the sources of the investigation, the subject of the investigation is the alleged receipt of commissions of Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a construction company in Galicia to requalify 200 hectares of land.
At the moment, there are eight detainees.
Bono agreed to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's candidacy for Toledo and to chair the Congress if they win the elections
Former Defence Minister José Bono accepted the offer of the President of the Government and the Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to lead the Spanish Socialist Party's list for Toledo in the forthcoming general elections and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general elections.
So the organizing secretary of the Spanish Socialist Party, José Blanco, and Bono himself announced this during a press conference after the meeting that took place this afternoon at the federal headquarters of the Spanish Socialist Party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive justified the offer made to the former minister because "it is important to count on the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best."
Moreover, he stressed that "yes it seems" that the politician of La Manche will be the candidate of the Socialist group that will preside over the Congress if the Socialists win the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín as President of the Congress, which announced on November 15 its decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his political career in order to devote itself to the fight against climate change within the academic framework.
The former Minister acknowledged that the President of the Government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he abandoned him two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, although citizens already know who will be the economic vice-president if the Spanish Socialist Party wins the elections, his party wanted to announce the president of the Congress in an "act of transparency."
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to transform the House into "a house of respect and not of insult or cry" and make it "more and more like citizens."
"Sometimes it seems lamentably that the only local in Madrid where one cannot speak calmly and calmly is the Congress, the President of the Government in the Senate on some occasions has been interrupted 26 times."
In the same way, he had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his know-how" and he did not want to pretend that he was already in his position so as not to fall, as he pointed out, into what his opponents might consider as "domination."
A climate propaganda
Since the climate change movement is subjecting the sceptics of its predictions as well as those who give priority to other political and social battles to persecution without mercy, it must demonstrate iron consistency.
This is all the more the case for a leader of the movement who is President of the Government like Zapatero and who believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract for the planet."
This approach obliges him to explain why his Government's action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain's being at the head of the European Union in the non-implementation of the Kyoto Protocols.
Who is responsible for the non-execution, in which sectors it has occurred, and why its Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
Moreover, it must explain clearly to the Spaniards what measures it will take to curb climate change.
What businesses will be affected, what habits citizens will have to change, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences this will have.
That is, who will sacrifice himself and pay to save the planet.
But there has been and there will be no explanation.
Precisely because it's about sacrificing and paying.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Coarse, uncomfortable and threatening for the accounts of companies and individuals.
Until the hundredth of the essence suggested by the Spanish Socialist Party seemed to him to be so much dangerous in Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is to say, it is about saving the planet with nothing, only with propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With sentences that have impact, commissions, committees, protocols, new positions.
With these contracts with the planet, this man so useful for electoral campaigns that do not speak, do not denounce and do not demand, enhances meetings and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is only a purely virtual contracting party and does not claim that we are travelling by bicycle or refreshing ourselves with the fan.
Mayor and local police chief in Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption
The Spanish gendarmerie arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and a hotel entrepreneur suspected of possible urban crimes, today informed the sources of the investigation.
The municipal councillor was arrested at his home and was taken to the city hall, where at the moment many agents met, who also presented themselves to the function of municipal councillor of Urbanism and to the municipal company of management of the Industrial Sol and Housing.
These three judgments are in addition to the six judgments made last Monday in the provinces of Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation relating to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to urbanize them so that the Galician company Nuaria can build 4,000 houses, after payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other persons have not been arrested but are charged in the judicial investigation, which Totana's No. 1 Tribunal investigates.
The first six detainees have now passed to judicial disposition.
According to the sources, the previous Totana municipal councillor and currently independent MP of the PP party, Juan Morales, is the subject of the investigation.
In addition, the ex-wife, the owner of a real estate agency currently registered in Totana, was charged, along with the current fiancée of the former municipal councillor, who resides in Murcia.
The director and owner of Groupe Nuaria, the lawyer and contractor of Vigo (Galicia) Manuel N.A., were arrested in Nigrán (Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of Suelo de Inmonuar, agency of Groupe Nuaria, and through which the bribes were allegedly made.
The investigation is the responsibility of the Urban Delinquency Group of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) of the gendarmerie, whose officers, in addition to the arrests, carried out eleven inspections, the majority in enterprises linked to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Thus, only one person was arrested in Totana, in short, the owner of a well-known poultry product business in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
Groupe Nuaria was responsible for the development of the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa."
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana, which has been reclassified, and its project would double the population of the commune, which currently has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group is made up of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which deal with real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the parking lots of Vigo in the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católico; Hogartel, which deals with direct marketing; Preconiza, which focuses on the promotion, sale and installation of building elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with the comment of yesterday published in Finland's most important newspaper (certainly at the top of PISA information above the educational level in the world), the Yemeni Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day it appeared there, curiously, the review of Blackburn's book:
"The content of the Philosophy course called public opinion into question as a result of the tragedy of Jokela's school.
The culprit of the dead, a baccalaureate student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Adviser in charge of Philosophy, Pekka Elo, demanded that teachers take a critical attitude towards Plato on what is written in the pages of the daily newspaper Héligin Sanomat and he affirmed that studying Nietzsche is not indispensable in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in high schools.

A colleague passes the information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of offences on downloads on the Internet:
A. Downloading a song would be an offence punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, theft in a CD store for a value of less than EUR 400 is considered to be a fault only (Article 623.1).
B. Theft in a store for a value of up to €1,000 is already considered a crime, but the penalty is lower than that imposed for downloading (article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is lower than the one imposed for the download (a section 244.1).
D. It is less serious to be involved in a fight than to be involved in the traffic of compact discs.
To participate in a tumultuous fight involves a penalty of three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and trafficking in CDs would involve a penalty of six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Penal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious than downloading a film, according to article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted films without the authors & apos; permission is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the real world then someone is exaggerating.

My attending doctor told me about one of his articles on strange research entitled, "Money produces brain activations, especially if the others receive less."
In other words, the feelings generated by the monthly pay of workers depend on what colleagues earn.
The study was carried out using tomographic magnetic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the neurocognition group at the Life & Brain Institute in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his companion failed."
The researchers observed that when both people assumed that they were receiving the same pay, activation was moderate, but if one of them received the double, activation was greater.
I don't know if that conclusion required so much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing war criminals in the Balkans for eight years since the Prosecutor's Office of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, which is located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bitter taste, because the main perpetrators of the murder of Srebrenica - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims are dead -, former General Ratko Mladic and former leader serbobosnio Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in this list whose documentary by Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach takes its title, 'Carla's list' (2006, not projected exclusively in Spain), with the rhythm of a police thriller, who follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade in New York who is pursuing the fugitives and pressures the governments involved to narrow the circle.
What insurance do I need?
Car insurance, which covers drivers in the face of possible losses, involves a significant expenditure which will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving licence, civil status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of the vehicle, among others.
Having a car is the main thing.
Y es que, escoger el seguro de automóvil adecuado es incluso más difícil que elegir el modelo de vehículo.
And it's that, choosing the right car insurance, is even more difficult than choosing the model of the vehicle.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insurer.
This compromise takes the form of an insurance contract, which establishes that the company receives the value of the premium granted and in return becomes responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a disaster.
The premium is the price of insurance, which takes into account various factors, such as age, sex, length of driving licence, marital status, type of vehicle to be insured or use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices on the basis of statistics, so that the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the rating to be paid.
It is for this reason that people over the age of 25 and women must pay lower premiums, since the statistics show that these people have a lower rate of claims due to their prudence.
Similarly, using censuses, the companies concluded that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will affect the frequency, and thus the likelihood of an accident.
By increasing the frequency the probabilities increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when determining the premium price.
This is why the driver needs to study the situation well in order to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
Here we will present the most significant variables when choosing one or the other type of insurance, so that the insurer, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insurer, offers it a reasonable price.
Young people under 25 years of age face various disadvantages when entering into an insurance contract at an accessible price, as may be the lack of experience in driving and the seniority of the driving licence.
Although the ideal to be well insured is insurance at any risk, other, more economical options exist.
The most forward-looking drivers can opt for risk-free insurance so that they get insurance coverage at any risk but at a more affordable price.
This form of agreement implies that the customer pays part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the loss that the customer pays will be based on the value of the premium, which will be higher plus the amount will be lower," says Luis Noguera, the head of First Europa in Spain, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer provides protection to deal with damage caused to third parties, but by those caused on his own car.
In addition, it would be covered against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age try to be careful and avoid losses as far as possible, since this will affect the bonus, which may reduce the price of insurance in the future.
A rebate is a reduction in the company's basic rate.
On the contrary, a penalty is an increase in the basic tariff.
"Subsidies and sanctions will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase the subsidies, "clarified Noguera.
After the age of 25, it becomes easier for drivers when they enter into a contract with insurance, since the loss rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
It is for this reason that it is preferable to choose all-risk insurance with a franchise.
"Normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience acquired in advance after an accident," says the director of the European company in Spain and adds that the majority of accidents occur during the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the novice' has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is preferable for the client to negotiate insurance at any risk, as long as his or her economic situation permits.
Child marriages are considered by insurers to be the people with the lowest claim rate, because the increases will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be any risk insurance with a deductible (possibly EUR 300), or extended third-party insurance from the third year of life of the vehicle when the insured has a high level of bonus.
"They have more casual driving and greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on more franchises," Judge Luis Noguera.
For pensioners, any-risk insurance with a deductible is preferable (i.e. 150 euros), or extended third-party insurance where the insurer has a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is important, not only because it covers the driver in the face of possible losses, but also because it represents an important expense, it is for this reason that it is essential to study properly the insurance that suits us most according to our personal situation.
The Celtic will try to win a point in Milan to get to the eighth of the finals
The Milan AC and the Celtic Glasgow are measuring themselves next Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to reach their respective goals in closing the Champions League, since it serves the Italians to be first and the Scots to classify themselves.
The Italians scored ten points and they already qualified in the fifth day thanks to a draw in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow has nine points, but he still needs another point to make sure that the Shakhtar Donetsk, who has six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not pass him.
These two D-Group games will be played a week before the sixth day ends, as AC Milan is scheduled to compete in the semifinals of the World Cup of Clubs in Japan on the 13th of this month in search of a spot for the final on December 16.
Thus, this group will remain closed before the draw at the Giuseppe Meazza stadium seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out victorious, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic Glasgow knows that if he wins he would stay first and make a better match in the final eight.
A defeat of Gordon Strachan's team could be enough to rank if the Shakhtar Donetsk does not win, but it will not be able to computer only on this since with nine points the game belongs to the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but who won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
For example, the Milanese will try to poison the Scots' evening, who have good hopes of finishing for the eighth finals for the second time at the Champions League, after being beaten during the last edition by a Kaka goal during the extensions (1-0).
Pending the victory of the 'rossoneri', the triumph would only go to the Shakhtar, in the event that the Celtic loses, in order to be able to continue the league of UEFA champions.
And it is that the Benfica, although last and without the possibility of continuing the European competition, could reach third place with a victory.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of about 20,000 spectators since the band disbanded in 2000.
'Posh Spice '(Victoria Beckham),' Scary Spice '(Melanie Brown),' Baby Spice '(Emma Bunton),' Sporty Spice '(Melanie Chisholm) and' Ginger Spice '(Geri Halliwell) said shortly before starting their concert at GM Place Stadium in Vancouver that the group's meeting was "brilliant."
Around 20,000 people used up the tickets to attend the concert, which was the subject of a video telling the story of the group that was furious at the end of the 1990's.
The meeting and the world tour coincided with the launch of a new album that reproduces their main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which EMI publishes in Spain.
The five members of the Spice Girls went on stage showing the bracelets that 'Posh Spice' 's husband had offered them, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was in the audience that filled the GM Place, even though Victoria had forbidden him a few days earlier.
Before the show started, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British footballer "didn't see our costumes so I'm nervous because I don't know what he's going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice ', who left the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" and which caused the group to dissolve two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a press interview, two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that people's feelings have changed, the feelings for the Spice Girls have changed.
And I thought why not, I'm glad I made a decision, "Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noticed that over time, "things have worked out and we appreciate each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girl last showed up in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV TV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines aircraft.
When they arrived at the airport, a babysitter army was waiting for them.
She has five seven sons.
After the Vancouver concert, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
In Madrid they will exhibit on December 23.
The new gas affair between Russia and Ukraine raises the alarm.
A gas price dispute is closing between Ukraine and Russia, thus increasing the risk of repercussions on oil exports to Europe.
Most Russian gas exports to the European Union (EU) are transported by gas pipelines, and each conduit is scrupulously monitored.
Kiev announced that if Russia increases the cost of fuel, it will increase transit taxes to Russia.
Last year, an altercation between the two caused a decrease in supplies to the EU countries.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes after the Ukrainian government and Gazprom, Russia's gas-supplying monopoly company, tried in vain, to reach an agreement on the cost of Russian gas supplied to Ukraine for the year 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would increase its prices to Ukraine as expected, as it agreed to pay up to 50% more for the supply of gas from neighbouring Turkmenistan for 2008.
Analysts stated that this would entail for Ukraine, a 40% increase in the costs of imports from Gazprom.
"It is essential for us to use all our arguments during the conversations, recalling that we are a country through which most gas flows," announced Ukrainian Minister of Economy, Anatoly Kinkh to the Reuters news agency.
"Fluctuations in gas costs would probably be linked to our discussions about transit taxes (to Western Europe) via Ukraine"
The last major altercation between Moscow and Kiev caused in January 2006, the interruption of Gazprom supplies destined for Ukraine.
This led to a fall in exports to Western Europe, thereby increasing prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of European Union supplies.
Russia has the largest gas stocks, although most of them are still underdeveloped.
As a result, Gazprom completes its own supplies with gas from Turkmenistan and other nations of the former Soviet Union in Central Asia.
The Ministry of Health 'must control its foreign employees'.
The Scottish Ministry of Health needs to improve the controls to be carried out on its non-EU employees to check whether they have criminal precedents, said the Monitoring Committee.
The General Reviewer Robert Black's warning came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was involved in the attack at Glasgow airport in June.
Mr. Black also expressed concern that the Scottish Ministry of Health has no precise data on the number of overseas workers it employs.
Nevertheless, his report highlighted other decisive checks carried out correctly on a sample of employees from five health authorities.
The Auditor General carried out checks on extra-Community staff following the attack on Glasgow airport.
Bilal Addullah, 28 years old, a doctor of Iraqi origin at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after sinking with his jeep in the doors of the main terminal.
He was one of the three doctors who were filmed at the Old Bailey in October, as he was suspected of being involved in various car explosion attempts in the UK.
The Ministry of Health will have to carry out pre-employment checks on overseas staff, to be sure of the validity of their qualifications, experiences, and work permits for the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Ministry of Health uses the Scottish Disclosure to carry out checks on previous criminal cases, the Agency has no right to obtain such information outside Great Britain.
Among the many warnings, the Auditor General's report now states that committees are required to confront the Office of Criminal Review, allowing employers to undertake checks on various countries.
"Although we found that some personnel information has been verified, this is not done every time." the report says.
Mr Black said that the Scottish Ministry of Health carries out most of the pre-employment checks he would do himself, but he also added: "our report highlights aspects where the system can be improved to ensure that adequate information on certain overseas staff is available to health services.
Mr. Peter Terry, President of BMA Scotland stated that it is "extremely unlikely" that pre-employment controls can identify employees who may commit future terrorist acts.
He said "the report suggests that the pre-use checks currently being carried out are working well in the Scottish health system and that it is not certain that these warnings can bring some added value."
The Scottish health authorities reported employing 1161 people from overseas, mostly doctors and nurses.
But the Auditor General has pointed out that these figures certainly need to be revised upwards, partly because of problems with the identification of staff with indefinite contracts, who may or may not choose to stay in our country.
The investigation has shown that the current control procedures of the health authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lothian are entirely adequate.
These checks are carried out on passports, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and system of pre-employment checks for personnel in the health service overseas.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I was excited to do this work following the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport."
She added that the Scottish Government allied with the health committees would carefully consider the warnings set out in the report to be issued next month, and commit to ensuring better implementation of the recently updated pre-employment checks, valid for all employees, including overseas workers.
Joy Division dominates the Oscars.
Control, the bio pick on Joy Division's latest singer, Ian Curts, won 5 awards, including the best film, at the British Independent Film Oscars.

The awards were distributed during the ceremony at the London's Round House.
Control relates the climb to Curtis's success with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, 23 years old.
The film in black and white whose music was made by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order, was shot with a budget of just 3 million Sterling.
But the Dutch photographer, best known for his iconic cover of U2's Joshua Tree album, won two awards, the first as the best director and the second as the best novice director.
The Rock was also awarded the Best Documentary Award for Julien Temple's film on Clash singer Joe Strummer.
The Best Actor Award was presented to Viggo Mortensen for his performance of the driver of a Russian mafia boss in the Londrès-based thriller directed by David Cronenberg, Easter Promises.
Ray Winstone, renowned for his tough character performances, won the Richard Harris Award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old director, having shot films such as Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the sequel of Indiana Jones, The Kingdom of Cristal Skull.
Winstone said he was proud to receive this award named in honour of star Harris, protagonist in Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
Richard Harris and Albert Finney have allowed people like me to have access to the movies, "he said.
"I've been lucky enough to meet Richard Harris twice."
"I was admiring in front of this great actor today, I was extremely honored"
The Oscars of the independent film, better known as the "Bifas" are awarded by a jury composed of directors, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa fans and bosses include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom
Saudi Arabia blocks 208 terrifying plots
Saudi Arabia yesterday revealed that it had arrested 208 militants involved in organizing cells that were waging an imminent attack on an oil site, as well as attacks on clerics and the armed forces.
State television of the world's largest oil exporter, said that one of the missile smugglers cells.
Al Qaeda supporters have staged a campaign against the allied monarchy in the United States since 2003, following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight activists, led by a foreign resident, was planning an attack on an oil site in Orientale Province, said the TV newspaper.
Saudi Arabia quickly set up a group of 35,000 troops to protect the sites, following a failed attack by Al Qaeda in 2006, against the largest oil site in Abqaiq.
The newspaper citing a statement by the Minister of the Interior, said that 18 of the arrested persons belong to a cell headed by a "missile launch expert" who has infiltrated the country.
It is said that the militants were planning the counter-pack of eight missiles in the kingdom.
22 of the detainees appear to have plotted the murder of clergymen and armed forces.
The government has asked the clergymen to do more against the Saudi led in Iraq, to join Al Qaeda militants fighting against the Allied Forces and against the Muslim Shiite government allied to the United States, considered heretic according to the Saudi Sunny line.
Al Qaeda activists believe that in Saudi Arabia, many ecclesiastics have collaborated with the authorities to support the policy of the royal family that dominates the government.
Activists, encouraged by appeals against the pro-western Saudi government, by Osama Bin Laden, leader of Al Qaeda of Saudi origin, targeted foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy supply sites.
Major efforts have been made by the armed forces in the last five months... "said the Minister of the Interior's spokesman on state television.
Among the detainees, there are 16 members of the Medina organized in a "media cell" to promote "Takfiri thought," the ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that supports the use of violence against unfaithful and apostate Muslims.
Of the detainees, 32 are accused of subsidizing the activists.
The climate of Venus could reveal the future of the Earth.
Scientists said yesterday that Venus was certainly a pleasant planet to live on.
Data from the European spacecraft in orbit have shown that the planet is certainly twice as small as the Earth, contrary to what was previously thought.
Venus is the planet closest to Earth.
These two worlds are almost the same size, with similar orbits, although Venus is closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago, Venus might have had conditions similar to those of the Earth, and could even have been habitable.
But the greenhouse effect due to carbon dioxide, the atmospheric erosion due to solar radiation combined with slower rotation, has led Venus to another kind of evolution.
Today the planet is deprived of water, is ravaged by hurricanes and lightning storms and has a temperature surface warm enough to melt lead.
The discoveries of Venus Express, the probe of the European Space Agency, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sad vision of the potential future of the Earth due to catastrophic climate changes.
Professor of the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford, Fred Taylor, one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, said: "We are beginning to understand why Venus' climate is so different from that of the Earth, although the planets themselves are practically similar.
"Our new data allows us to establish a scenario according to which billions of years ago, Venus would have been originally identical to the Earth, perhaps even with a living area."
Enriched uranium sequestered by the police.
A kilo of radioactive material, apparently uranium, was sequestered by the Czechoslovak and Hungarian police yesterday.
One police officer stated that three persons had been arrested and that the equipment was currently being analysed.
He did not confirm that it was uranium, but revealed that the commodity would have a value of $1 million (£480,000).
Still open to anything
Mitt Romney said he was not up to the task of running for president, answering questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates finally agreed to participate in the You Tube debate, during which many ordinary voters registered their questions, submit them to the candidates.
Wednesday evening, November 28, none of the questions asked was as ridiculous as the one from another You Tube debate, when a snowman asked the democrats for their position on global warming.
But this time, the questions and answers have largely reflected the conditions of the Republican party, which is the candidate for the next election.
We don't know which criteria, the CNN producers, who sponsored the debate, chose the clips of You Tube to show the aspiring candidates.
But the first half hour of the debate, the longest one-theme debate, focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strong subjects for Republicans.
CNN asked some electors to call when they heard pleasant things: The board noted increases in approval when candidates spoke coarsely.
The hardest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, leader of the national front, and Mr. Romney, who led the important early elections in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tried to highlight the fact that he was accommodating about illegal immigration during his tenure as mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of employing illegal immigrants at his home.
The two fighters became particularly ferocious when asked if they would be willing to promote "amnesia" (offering illegal immigrants a regular status and the opportunity to become citizens).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California Congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressman, have managed to deepen this topic.
None of them have the opportunity to be elected, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they started fighting immigration before and more incisive than the others.
In general, candidates, at least with regard to immigration, have the same views: more rigid borders, and zero tolerance for illegal immigrants.
This subject, combined with the concerns raised in particular by the case of toxic toys made in China, or other fears towards the outside world, encourages Republicans to forget, or minimize, divisions between the libertarians and the Catholic Conservatives.
But the debate became particularly embarrassing when other issues were raised.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he had previously supported the arms control campaign.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether putting water in the nose should be considered torture.
One speaker asked whether the candidates fully believed in the content of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to dare to declare that the Bible is his favorite book, even if he is not sure to believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another speaker asked whether Jesus would have been in favour of the death penalty.
It was not expected to see Mike Huckabee, - in pole position in Iowa in a recent election, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism - say that the death penalty is painful though necessary.
When one insisted on whether Jesus would have been in favor, he laughed and said that Jesus was too chic to run for office.
The human race remains unnecessarily open to anything.
Mr. Huckabee's return to Iowa coincides with the recent prodigious research on grants conducted by libertarian Ron Paul, and the whistles during Wednesday's debate.
These two are emerging from the nothingness, thanks to the fact that the two protégés of the party cannot agree to decide who is the most known and more traditionalist candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate unified the party early and convincingly through a message of success on American greatness bringing the leaders closer together.
This time, the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
The Pain of the Workers
Gordon Brown discovered a new hole in which to sink; even if he resigned, the situation would not change.
Given the tendency of British scandals, this is not particularly juicy.
No decorations sold, no Parisian hotel bills from politicians, no extra marital foot sucked.
But there is a revelation that a wealthy businessman would have masked his contributions to the current Labour Party, equivalent to more than £650,000 ($1.3m), for four years under false names, which the party would not have declared: A new battle that Gordon Brown would have done well.
Two months ago, the Prime Minister turned back on his election project, insulting the British intelligence stupidly saying that opinion polls did not influence his decision, and that he hoped instead, to offer a compact and effective government.
On the contrary, such as Vince Cable, the brilliant Liberal Democrat leader, said that terrifying Mr. Brown has transformed himself from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The takeover of Northern Rock, a bank in difficulty on the crack edge, demonstrated a flaw in the guidelines and poor judgment in an emergency.
Inadequate proposals to change the tax code have led to a coalition of industrial groups against the government.
The loss of 25 million personal data from the tax authorities, revealed an incredible administrative boom.
A retired trio of generals launched a revolt among the Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: they proclaimed that being defence minister is for them, a part-time job.
At present, the suspicion of suspicious donations from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Secretary General of Labour (and his former head of vigilance), has forced them to resign.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading out.
However, governments can reach a point where it would be impossible to govern.
People don't like politicians, and don't trust them, but usually leave their doubts aside when a new government comes to power.
It seems obvious that a prime minister cannot improve things, or even govern for a long time, when he risks suspension: the public administration no longer works; ministers' offices take stock; the press is looking for bad stories; and the government is becoming defensive and without any goals.
In a sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, he cannot boast of being a beginner.
Although he would like to repudiate Tony Blair, he was still his superior lieutenant.
The problems relating to Northern Rock and tax data, for example, are related to Mr. Brown's decisions when he was British Treasury Chancellor.
And even if he is not directly involved in Blair's misfortunes, such as the long investigation of party funds "cash for members of the House of Lords," voters might think otherwise.
But the difficult situation Mr. Brown is facing is not as tragic as it looks.
The gaffes are not so monstrous as members of the Tories party suggest.
As in Mr. Bean, there are no victims or scams.
And the remedy, though painful, could be to put into practice the Stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown of all time, in favour of a reliable and slightly brutal government.
The new scandal about political donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, a very special character who compares his donations to charity, stated that he did not want any public recognition of his charity.
He may have his opinion, but it's not up to him to decide.
The laws against the anonymity of the big subsidizers of politicians are clear, and they exist for a good reason: The public has the right to know who contributes to the success of those who will govern the country.
Mr. Watt, who stated that he was aware of Mr. Abrahams' programs, without knowing that it was illegal, would therefore have to be questioned, as would Jon Mendlesohn, the head of the grant collection who had referred to questionable donations in October.
But so far Mr. Brown is not involved: there is no evidence that he was aware of these steps, although most of the payments made were made following his arrival in the government in June.
So far the prime minister has done half.
He quickly condemned his party's legislative loophole, but did not draw attention to the fact that the decision-making power is based on something he knows well, using a committee of inquiry on this subject composed of a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons to be learned are not complicated.
And if the law has been violated, it's up to the police.
In addition, there are many other things Mr. Brown needs to do, such as finding a permanent chair for the independent Committee on Public Life Standards, without a leader for six months, and preparing a good reform on the financial side of political parties.
This would force the Labour Party, in a moment of weakness, to collaborate with the Tories, which could lead it to abandon its particular financial relationship with the confederations; in short, a bitter pill for a supporter such as Mr. Brown.
But he should face certain partisan facts.
The Conservative party now has a good advantage for the elections; it has two years to win the voters, and the only way to win is to demonstrate impeccable integrity and strong skills.
Card scavenging.
Would the mortgage crisis contaminate the US credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is normal to see stirred fins, swirling around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is in a critical phase, predators are targeting the U.S. credit card market.
Goldman Sachs analysts believe that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the contagion extends from mortgages to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases in the cost and insolvency rates, which measures unrecoverable or unrecoverable balance sheet shares more than 30 days later.
HSBC announced last month that it took $1.4 billion in credit to the consumer, partly because of the weakness of cardholders.
It's still too early to panic.
The costs and insolvabilities are still moderate.
According to Moody, a tax agency, the third quarter insolvency rate of 3.89% is almost one point lower than its historical average.
The deterioration of rates is partly explained by technical factors.
A change of laws in the United States in 2005 regarding personal bankruptcy caused a sharp fall in bankruptcy records, which in turn caused heavy losses for credit cards; the number of records (and hence insolvency rates) could increase even if borrowing conditions were to worsen.
The industry also announces fixed payment rates, which highlight the amount of monthly debt consumers have to pay.
and confidence in the security of credit card capital is quite strong despite the paralysis of other aspects of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research company, predicted that the issue volume for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection links between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers might prefer to increase their debt now that fair real estate borrowing has disappeared.
But card issuers pay more attention to cash flow than to the value of wealth, and therefore the fall in real estate prices has not necessarily led to a change in the credibility of borrowers.
They could even bring benefits to credit issuers.
Consumer premiums for mortgage payments fall if property costs less than the value of the loan; consequently, credit card debt would become a priority for repaying.
Card issuers are able to respond much faster than mortgages and more flexibly to such crisis conditions, as they can change interest rates or alter credit limits.
This should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid resumption of actions.
"We're not gonna wake up one morning and reassess all the loans," said Gary Perlin, Capital One's manager.
If a financial disaster in the credit card market is unlikely, there is a high risk of a significant decline.
If lower real estate prices and a contraction in the credit market lead America to recession, the industry will certainly have to face a grim future.
Take good care of the dorsal fins..
British bankers plead guilty to the Enron case.
The three British bankers who were due to testify their roles in relation to a fraud committed by Enron's former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, changed their statement, pleading guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew had initially declared themselves innocent of the seven charges of alleged collusive fraud in 2000, committed by Fastow in a secret financial fraud in order to enrich themselves in spite of their employees.
They are expected to appear in court in January.
But during a hearing presided over by U.S. judge Ewing Werlein Jr, they all found themselves guilty of committing fraud.
The three ex-executives of Greenwich NatWest, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland's PLC Group, became famous throughout Great Britain because of the two-year extradition procedures.
In the United States, their case is still a pending issue for this investigation launched following the fall of Enron in 2001.
The charges against them in 2002 made Fastow understand that he was the subject of the government's investigation into the Enron debacle.
The charges against the bankers, dubbed the "Natwest Three" claim to have come to Houston in 2000, to organize a fraudulent scenario with Fastow and his ex-right-arm, Michael Kopper.
NatWest Greenwich invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partner controlled by Fastow, who was the director of many fraudulent scenarios, who helped him to rig bankruptcy proceedings.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank had estimated its interest in the subsidiary to be nil, but in fact the three British companies already know its value.
A company controlled by Kopper bought the interest from the subsidiary bank for £1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 as an interest in this company.
According to the accused, Fastow falsely announced to Enron that the energy company was willing to pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its shares in the subsidiary.
But the truth is, these $20 million went into the pockets of British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the charges, the bankers earned $7.3 while Fastow, Kopper and the others earned $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to his active role in two conspiracies in Enron's debacle.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow faces a six-year incarceration in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is incarcerated for 3 years and a month in a prison in Texarkana.
The three British men were released on bail of $1 million each, forcing them to live in the United States during the trial.
Enron, formerly the seventh largest national company, in bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting rigging, could no longer hide its billions of debt nor even propose its bogus speculations as profitable.
The collapse resulted in thousands of lay-offs, more than $60 billion in lost market value and more than $2 billion in losses to pension plans.
Enron's founder, Kenneth Lay and former president-general Jeffrey Skilling were condemned last year for their involvement in the collapse of society.
Skilling was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison.
The charges against Lay for conspiracy, fraud and other crimes were in vain because of his death due to a heart attack last year.
Not under, not outside Moscow.
The cost of a G550 Gulfstream aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with sufficient fuel range to fly without stop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is $54 million.
But this is only a small change for some Russians.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"Even if no one really needs so many seats because it is more a family-use plane or for the president of a company."
Mr. Firer was present at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Salon, a four-day consumer incentive orgy held in a huge exhibition centre around the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other exhibitors were present with their stands, hoping to arouse the interest of the new rich Russians for their varied products, ranging from mahogany yachts to diamond-filled cars like those of 50 Cent.
Mr. Firer was looking at a bright orange Porsche, exposed next to his stand.
"It's a pretty car, but nothing like our product," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
"Thanks to an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be rolling in black gold, like Dallas"
"We experienced the same thing in the 1890s, when some Americans became so rich and landed in Europe where they were considered materialists," said Marshall Goldman, a senior scholar in the Davis Department of Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudis in the 70s, the Japanese in the 90s, the Russians emerge as the world's largest consumer.
The biggest luxury brands are looking for their place in the Klondike.
This week, in another location in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry allowed Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange their ideas on the strategy to follow for the sale of luxury goods to markets like Russia.
(The conference was organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times.)
Russia has 53 billionaires worth $282 billion, according to the Forbes list listing the richest people.
In addition, two thirds of the rich are made up of 103,000 Russian millionaires who are worth $670 billion overall, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, carried out by economists of the economic and financial research centre.
(The World Bank stated that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the poverty line).
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow, that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a representative of London jeweler Davis Morris.
She participated in the show for the first time in the company of the Russian distributor, Le Groupe Bijoutier de Soho.
"Women are all well prepared and men are worth a fortune."
Walking in the living room on Sunday night, the two real estate agents put on their 31, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26 claim to be like their clients, millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and trying to choose between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Ms. Yumatova, who grabbed her haute couture dress like a red carpet veteran like Joan Rivers.
The salon seems to be primarily aimed at the new rich, the kind of buyers of Russian brands willing to queue in the stoppers to come to a huge warehouse where Cadillac Escalades, platinium canoes, Mövenpick ice cream, personalized billiard tables, Dubai apartments and Gund teddy bears are displayed.
The public could buy the tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"Russians are interested in defining the most expensive and best brands," said Mr. Gijrath, sitting proudly at the Royal Dutch porcelain factory stand Delf, in front of a wall painting of Raimbrant on blue tiles, handmade.
"it is certain that the Russians are more interested in bling bling"
In fact, the vendors have stated here that Russians with old capital (10 to 15 years are too much according to Russian standards) have already moved from brilliant logos to a kind of limited-edition brand that could not be sold at the show.
Despite this, thousands of people, whether millionaires, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, go through the exhibition every day.
And some even buy.
On the first night of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershow, the CEO of King Koil beds, said he sold two sets of silk mattresses, cashmere, and cotton inlaid with gold wire.
During the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, the sales manager of A1 motorcycle, a company that teams cars with state-of-the-art alarm systems, also said he sold a Russian millionaire, the brilliant orange Porsche, for $170,000.
By Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that customizes luxury cars, said he would sell three bracelets-like cars for Rolls-Royce Phantoms at $55,000 each.
He showed a reporter, the wheel of a car designed for the owner of a Russian casino, who wanted it to be inlaid with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
The set of four costs $22,000.
"The Russian millionaire who wants wheels made of ostrich leather, or a photo of his wife made of cubic zirconium, does not necessarily drive with such tires," said Karapetian.
He will certainly keep it in his garage already containing 30 or 40 vehicles "
Although many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the term "Russian millionaire" is not on the agenda, given the rise in real estate prices here.
"If you had bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you would already be a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"there's more than you could think"
Those who are not millionaires can at least feel this emotion when they go to the stand of Alliance Continental, a Russian heritage management company.
The company erected four stands representing the British telephone booths, filled with a mass of counterfeit dollars.
Azad Karryv, the company's marketing director, said that his team printed 500,000 counterfeit tickets for the Millionaire show.
Passengers arrested to launch masses of banknotes, ask their friends to photograph them on their mobile, in the midst of this false wealth or even putting a few million.
"You see, here in Moscow, everyone can feel a millionaire," said Mr. Karyev.
Non-licensed surgeon suspected of homicide in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the bay of Just a Little Healthier and observed an ambulance that had just stopped at the gates of white Cape Cod on West Scott Avenue.
Then came the police patrol.
And then another one.
"Then I saw the medical vehicle stop," Mr. Livingston, a restaurant manager, said on Wednesday.
That's when I realized someone died.
The authorities would then learn that the deceased was a 41-year-old woman, Olga Arroyo, assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Now the investigators are trying to determine if the cause of his death is due to a gesture carried out by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon, who the police have not yet identified, residing at 212 West Scott Avenue.
The authorities have not yet determined the causes of the death of Ms. Arroyo, but they are waiting for the results of the toxicological tests, which, unfortunately, will take time, but which should solve the mysterious death that saddened the top ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been assistant to the police director, Garry F. Mc Carthy, since September 2006, and her voice was well known in various departments.
She was loyal, hard working and tenacious, "McCarthy said about Ms. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday."
"she was like a pit bull"
"she would have done everything to protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was married to Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who worked for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11 years old, and a daughter-in-law.
Eileen Walsj, spokesperson for the Union County Public Prosecutor's Office, Theodore J. Romankow, said the detectives were trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died due to an unauthorized surgery.
"It's a possibility to consider."
"the investigation is continuing."
The authorities said they arrived at her house around 3: 00 p.m.
and found Miss Arroyo on the sofa.
She was declared dead.
A little over a week has passed since, and the authorities did not say much about the investigation or even about the owner of the house identified as Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not confirm whether Ms. Castro was questioned by the authorities.
Investigators are trying to understand if part of the house was used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Melle Castro's house where a faded rose lies in the narrow cemetery in front, and a Dalmatian barked in the back.
A blue can called "Ethyl Vanillin" used as a substitute for vanilla in the kitchen and for perfumes, lay in a hangar, next to a door that leads to the basement.
Two all-terrain bikes hanging on the sides.
McCarthy stated that since she arrived in Newark 25 years ago at the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroyo has been extremely valuable, helping her navigate the new city and abandon her framed political culture.
"She said," you have to pay attention to this, "he said.
"she was there when I came, and still there when I was leaving.
"It was embarrassing."
Everyone hopes that the Federal Reserve will reduce the rates associated with the upsurge in the world stock market.
Shares are blown up on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, after the market hoped that the Federal Reserve would have tried to calm credit conditions, subsequently reducing interest rates promoted by soothing statements by the vice president of the US central bank.
Stock markets are exploding in Londrès, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, # 2 after Ben Bernanke, President of the Federal Reserve, said that those who decide, must be "flexible and pragmatic" in their actions in troubled financial markets.
In an obvious effort to reassure irritable markets in the light of these new credit tensions, Mr. Kohn stated that the recent turbulence has partly "reversed certain improvements in the functioning of the market at the end of September and October.
Should this harsh turbulence persist, it would increase the likelihood of further rigidity in financial conditions for owners and businesses, he said.
These comments appear to investors as a clear signal that the Federal Reserve is ready to inject new capital into US markets, and that further interest rate reductions could stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street with even worse news about the U.S. economy, such as the biggest drop in real estate sales for the month of October.
The impact of this financial turmoil has been accentuated by the announcement by Bear Stearns, an investment bank, that it will lay off 650 people, that is, 4% of its staff, to reduce the costs to compensate for the heavy losses due to the losing bets on real estate loans.
Only 20 posts are planned in Londrès, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average for the Dow Jones increased by 331 points, or 2.55% to 13.289.40, while the largest index, S & P 500, increased by 2.65%.
In Londrès, the FTSE 100 index rose to 165.5 points or 2.7% to 6306.2 adding more than £39 to the value of British companies.
The German Dax index rose by 2.6% and the French CAC40 rose by 2.3%.
Previously, the resurgence of credit difficulties in the markets was highlighted by the strong demand for a monthly tri-fund auction by the European Central Bank, which cut these loans to European commercial banks at a high rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the EDF and the ECB and to inject subsequent funds into London's financial markets, causing credit tensions, has led to the fact that the monthly three-month "Libor" borrowing rates of British banks, have caused their highest growth since last September, at 6.59% following a strong upturn since 12 November.
England is facing a call for judgment against the critics of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopar.
We are faced with two dilemmas, one as difficult as the other.
Who will be drummer # 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopar?
And even more important in a context as broad as the first Test against Sri Lanka, who will make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the breeder president who was here exceptionally to help Peter Moores, head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, make his decision, and because the office of Hugh Morris, the President and CEO of England, is beginning to fill out the application forms to become a national breeder, at least on a part-time basis.
Anyone who fails to win the No. 6 race will be unlucky, but life is often unfair and sport is also unfair.
It is never easy to destroy what allows a man to reach the top of his profession while another will never reach beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck more than for lack of skill.
It is not just at cricket that selection is difficult, because in the end, judgment remains subjective.
Is it the right time to bring out Bopar?
Is that just about Shah?
The same could be proposed in another context, which choose between John Edwards or Banerjee "tubby"?; both, new professionals with good qualifications, should be promoted: but there is only room for one of them.
Who has the right to determine the correct level of a cricketer unless at least one chance is given?
Figures are important in decisions, but also in opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricketer must capture the captain's eye, at the same time he must take the door and a drummer must be lucky to touch the cricketer for a day.
But capturing the eyes of the selectors is much more complicated.
Many did better last season, for example, James Anderson, who seemed certain to play the first test, even though Stephen Harmison declared himself fit and continued to train to serve.
Anderson took 32 first class doors on 33 laps to win a seat.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same average, but both have already lived their moment of glory at the highest level and hope to offer again.
If it's Shah or Bopar playing at the Asgiriyah Stadium, it's just a matter of opinion.
This choice could destroy or build a man's career, but it makes little difference.
Four years ago, in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with five useful doors and 40 laps, but it was Paul Collingwood, who was also struggling to emerge, who managed to become the primordial cricketer of the Test, despite the fact that his double-hundredth score against Australia in Australia could still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan, and Moores, following another discussion after today's session at Asgiriya Stadium, will certainly follow their conservative instincts and promote Shah's greatest experience against the exuberance of the young Bopar.
Both have good arguments.
In favour of Shah, his brilliant and considerable debut at the 88 Test innings in Bombay, 32 cents first class against six for Bopar, who at 22 is seven years younger, and his excellent ranking at the launch.
But Shah did only ten laps in his two innings in May against the Caribbean during the Test to Lord, his Middlesex city, and that, the immediate rejection by the breeders when Vaughan was back in shape, claimed his place for the next game, seems to have afflicted his elves so obvious in Bombay.
Unlike him, the Essex player is full of joy to live.
Nothing scares him on a cricket pitch and he exaggerated when he recently got stuck on a 4x4 during a presentation by Volkswagen, the sponsor of England.
He only reported minor injuries, was shocked, even though the first thing he did was take his Vodafone (sponsor of course) and call Alastair Cook, his partner who was looking at him from afar, to ask him if he had seen this?
Bopar is by far the best drummer, his filming style allows him to do services that suit him, and that he beats with confidence and professionalism.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe this is the real art of selection?
I would be inclined to give Bopar his chance, which does not mean that Shah should not apply if, as tea leaves suggest, he will play this weekend.
The buses bring people back to work, and fight al Qaeda.
The first bus filled with Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, dumping these exiles without money or visa renewals, or others who hope that the city has returned to normality.
Some have returned to fight against activists who have taken them away from their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of Damascus of 800 people transported in convoys of dozens of official government buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who returned by their means.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed several doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came home today because I saw on TV and read in the newspapers what happened in Baghdad and because the city is safer now."
"They say that the Mahdi army no longer commits crimes!" he said, referring to the Shia militia of ecclesiastical activist Moqtada al-Sadr, who forced his men to leave for the moment.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shia teacher from the Sunni-dominated Amariyah area, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visa and because the regime prevented Iraqis from working.
His neighbours from Shia to Amariyah called him to inform him that the United States-assisted militia had driven Al Qaeda out of the west of the capital, and invited him to return.
One of Jordan's newcomers is the leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who had to leave his home north of Baghdad because of a grenade attack after he incited citizens to rebel against Al-Qaeda.
But he had to go home to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had set up an anti-Qaeda militia in Sleikh, and that they needed me and my boys."
"That's why I'm going home today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many say they have been attracted by the growing lull of the capital since American troops arrived, and to the continued formation of well-armed "groups of citizens involved" working with the American military to defend their neighbourhood.
But still others say they were forced to return because of the visa problem and the decadence of the capital of Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in past years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old, father of three children, expressed the suspicion felt by all about the visas for exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, Prime Minister Shia, who reportedly asked the Syrian government to limit in order to force people to return to the country.
More than two and a half million people have reportedly fled the country because of the sectarian squadrons of death.
"We had no problem until al-Maliki came to Syria and urged the government to stop giving Iraqi visas to force them to return to Iraq," said Retired Sunni.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who burned down my house when I left."
The decrease in violence can be explained in part by the fact that the Sunnis have been driven out of Shia areas and vice versa, creating places where tensions are lower.
There is concern that a sudden flow of refugees will once again increase sectarian tensions and bring back fighting.
Little Saar, good training.
The smallest federal state leads in vocational training, and even shines by the international orientation of its higher schools.
It is only in one area that a deficit weighs on the Sarrois, similar to that of the rest of the country.
"I explained yesterday for the 50th time to a non Sarrois, that we are not French" - this is the slogan that the smallest federated state, by self-derision, displays for its 50th anniversary.
At this level, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland training system, which is placed fifth in the training monitor of the German Institute of Economics in Cologne.
Thus, already by tradition, the higher schools cooperate closely with neighbouring countries.
The university was founded in Saarbrücken in 1948 by the French.
To date, students have the opportunity to complete their studies there with a double or even a triple degree.
This is evidenced by the high quota of 15.6 per cent of international students.
The Saarland also leads the children of the country to higher-than-average schools - many of them without a Gymnasium diploma.
"In Saarland, we take advantage of the vocational training system," says Axel Plünnecke, training expert at IW.
More than one in five young people gets their diploma from a vocational school, so the Saarland is more than seven points above the national average.
The possibilities for combining vocational and academic training are also relatively well developed.
In view of the number of inhabitants, the dual course panel is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarrois has forced the higher education schools to carry out a marketing campaign in engineering science.
"After the first PISA studies, we celebrated a large number of reforms in general schools," said a spokesperson from the Ministry of Education.
Thus the government has introduced comparison tests throughout the federal state.
In order for children to start learning earlier, the last year of nursery school is free of charge - a model that in the meantime other states also copy.
Only future comparative studies will be able to show whether students' performance is improving in a sustainable manner.
In PISA studies in 2003, the proportion of at-risk students decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
In total, however, Saar has not improved as much as other states.
The Bavarians are doing better.
And in spite of Sarrois, knowledge of foreign languages is not measured by PISA studies - otherwise you could gain points in this area.
Because the neighbour's language is compulsory in high schools - even if Sarrois are not French.
Chávez sets the watches
In Venezuela, watches will soon be ticking differently than in the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chavez will bring the clock up by half an hour in the South American country.
In the meantime, Chavez became a cartoon in Spain.
As the official newspaper of Venezuela reported, due to a new law, the watches will be set at less than four and a half hours of universal time.
In this way, the South American country obtains a time zone that does not exist in any other state of the world.
The anti-American Chávez justified his position, among other things, by the fact that the United States would have imposed on the world the separation of time zones in full hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (local time) the cessation of relations with the neighbouring country, Colombia, as a result of a hostage affair.
The left-wing nationalist announced that as long as Conservative Alvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia, he would not maintain relations with either the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I cannot do that, because of my dignity alone," Chávez said, hastening a constitutional reform on which the citizens of the oil country will have to vote by referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, it would significantly strengthen its power in the country.
The trigger for this dispute was Uribe's decision to withdraw Chávez's mandate to negotiate the release of hostages with Marxist rebels in Colombia.
Uribe would have "spit in the face" of Venezuela with this decision, had criticized Sunday Chávez.
In Spain also Chávez is in all mouths.
A new mobile phone ringing is furious in the country: "Por qué no te callas" (why don't you shut up) is the phrase that already more than half a million people have downloaded on the internet.
It was pronounced by the Spanish King Juan Carlos, who, at the most recent Ibero-American summit, was upset by the constant arrests of the left populists and who told him to remain silent.
A fall in wages threatens Germany in 2007.
Despite the strong economic situation, real wage losses are forecast to threaten German employees this year.
Experts have cited a variety of reasons for their prognostic pessimism.
According to a calculation by the Hans-Böckler Foundation, employees should expect a real decrease in their payroll in 2007 compared to the previous year.
"The fault lies in the weak development of wages, the increase in the Value Added Tax and the rise in food and energy prices," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macro-Economy and Economic Research, in the newspaper "Bild."
There may also be new charges for unemployment insurance for the employee.
Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" that the projected fall in unemployment insurance of 3.3 percent for the new year was certainly correct and reasonable in the current situation.
However, the National Employment Agency no longer has the right to be embarrassed to ask the Federation for credits or financial aid, as the SPD politician said.
On Tuesday, it was known that the explosion in food and oil prices had pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
Overall, prices increased 3.0 per cent year-over-year.
Venus is the infernal twin of the Earth.
Despite its atmosphere hostile to life, Venus looks more like the Earth than we thought until now: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightning in the atmosphere and wind vortices at the poles, similar to those that appear in winter on Earth.
For almost three decades, scientists have assumed that there is lightning on Venus.
The European probe "Venus Express" has now proved this - it has detected electromagnetic waves at the limit of the atmosphere: lightning on Venus burst at a height of about 56 kilometers of cloud, reports Christopher Russel of the University of California in Los Angeles in the scientific magazine "Nature."
According to the famous cyprine theory, lightning would have made life appear on Earth: the storm would have stimulated reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the corner stone of life.
This is not the case on Venus: "If there was a life, it must have been at a very ancient date in history," explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
There should be little living on the surface of Venus today: the atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, temperatures of 500 degrees sometimes prevail.
"Venus may be Earth's infernal twin, but she remains a twin," Russel said.
Why Venus, which looks so much like the Earth in mass and dimensions, has been struck by such a different evolution, is the fundamental question of the mission ASE.
The departure of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was an important step in Venus research, as no probe had been on its way to explore this planet since the 1990s.
In the opinion of the researchers, the most recent research results that have now been presented in several "Nature" articles do not only highlight the singularity of Venus within the solar system.
They also show that the commonalities with the Earth of our neighbouring planet are more numerous than assumed at first.
Thus, in addition to the wind vortices already known at the North Pole, the researchers found a cloud vortex at the South Pole, which rotates much faster.
The phenomenon recalls the air currents in the terrestrial hemispheres in winter, writes a team of researchers around Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Istituto di Astrofisica Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the Earth and is, with a diameter of 12,100 kilometers, almost as large.
The planet called an evening or morning star rotates around the sun in just 225 days.
However, it rotates much more slowly on itself: a Venetian day lasts 243 earth days.
Although Venus, with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and pressure of 92 bar, hardly recalls the Earth, scientists assume that the two planets were formed under similar conditions.
On both, the water accumulated and remained on Earth in the form of oceans, but lost to space on Venus.
And while carbon dioxide has settled on Earth in the form of carbonate, it constitutes on Venus most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama.
The President of the Federal Republic of Germany Köhler demands the end of the party quarrel over the welcome of the Dalai Lama to the Chancellery.
Indirectly, he criticized the SPDs for the attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler cares about the appearance of Germany and summon the great coalition to close the dispute about the welcome of the Dalai Lama.
"We must not present to the outside world a divided nation on this issue," said Köhler to the Handelsblatt.
At the same time, Köhler showed understanding for Chancellor Angela Merkel's (CDU) welcome to Dalai Lama in September.
"Human rights have universal validity, even if I respect differences between cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knows that Germany should maintain a sensitive balance in foreign policy, stressed the President of the Federal Republic, but defended Merkel against accusations that it would organise a new policy for China.
The German Chancellor has not distanced herself from the traditional policy of a single China.
"China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steimeier (SPD) had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of the Dalai Lama and had been attacked for this outside the ranks of the CDU.
Steinmeier had complained in particular about the CDU's "front-end policy" on foreign policy.
After the Dalai Lama's welcome to the Chancellery, virulent irritations were felt in the German-Chinese relations.
Thus the Chinese government not only cancelled the German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD), but according to Spiegel's information, also froze the so-called strategy dialogue of the foreign ministers of the two countries.
The head of the government of China Wen Jiabao now demands German Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the Dalai Lama's welcome was a mistake.
China refuses to allow European politicians to receive the spiritual leader of Tibet in his official duties, thus supporting Wen Jiabao's Chinese position.
The Dalai Lama's words and actions would show that he is trying to separate Tibet from China and other Tibetan regions, which also includes other current provinces.
Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Street fights with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns against riots like those in France.
Every effort must be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not erupt in the streets through violence, demanded the German Minister of the Interior.
Burning barricades, rifles shooting at the police with hunting rifles: after the serious riots of young people in France, the German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears a similar development in Germany.
We must ensure that a social explosive does not build up in our own homes as well and defuse itself into violence.
We must take this seriously, "he said to the" Neue Presse "published in Hanover.
Not all young people would be able to cope with the rapid changes in social reality.
The Federation, the federal states and the communes were already working hard to reduce the problems, said Schäuble.
This would not only affect the integration of immigrants.
"From integration summits to conferences on Islam, it already shows its first successes."
But it would be too early for an end of warning.
Schäuble points out at the same time that in the German suburbs there are no sociological problems, nor from the point of view of urban planning as in France.
In the northern Paris agglomerations, young people had engaged in serious street battles with the police during the last nights.
In Toulouse too, cars and public buildings burned down.
Greater integration efforts on the part of the German government were required by the President of the Turkish communities in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the riots in France, Kolat warned against the "effects of imitation."
The situation in Germany would certainly not be as explosive as in France.
But there would still be a need for action.
Kolat stresses that the unemployment quota for young people under the age of 25 with an immigrant background would be higher than the average.
Above all, more space should be provided for training.
Kolat insisted: "We must give young people a perspective."
The President of the Turkish communities added, however, that social control in families took place more in Germany than in France.
Many young immigrants also do not want to destroy what their parents have built here.
Kolat exhorted, "But we must still be careful."
Young people should be given "early opportunity to participate in work and training."
Meanwhile, in the Parisian suburb of Villiers-le-Bel, everything remained very quiet during the night.
Police units were in place, a helicopter was flying over the area with spotlights.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as a few burnt cars and garbage cans.
Since the conference, a deployment of approximately 1,000 security forces has ensured calm.
The police will intervene as long as necessary, the Minister of the Interior Michelle Alliot-Marie announced, after a visit to the faubourg.
On Tuesday night, nearly 80 police officers were injured during the riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The following night, the troubles were overflowing in Toulouse.
The riots broke out after a traffic accident in which two young people had lost their lives on Sunday.
According to the early evidence of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the deaths of young people.
In Angela Merkel's empire.
The utopian entry of the Chancellor shows that the coalition has finished with the bottom - and that there is nothing left to expect from her.
Which country does this Chancellor live in?
After his disgraceful intervention in the general debates of the German Parliament, which was chaotic and lacking in content, it must be said: not here - not in the country which should ultimately be governed by it.
The criticism of focusing too much on politics was rejected by Angela Merkel with a harsh and presumptuous sentence.
It's provincial, she said and only showed that she doesn't want to understand what critics want.
In Parliament, it made visible to all how accurate this criticism was.
There was no concrete interest or feeling for the country's problems to be felt.
Instead, Angela presented herself as a cloud: a weightless politician, fleeing into foreign policy and even staying in the near future.
For example, the protection of the climate: in this regard, it welcomes again and again the Heiligendam agreements, but does not say how the climate objectives will be achieved in our country.
Even self-praise - having so little modesty, the leader of the CDU would have refused it again two years ago.
Now she clings to all-made formulas, that growth would affect people.
By this she destroys her image as a pragmatist, which solves problems instead of embellishing the world.
But in the Angela cloud empire, domestic policy problems are a marginal phenomenon.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage workers?
There are a few additional sentences left for this.
In this respect, the number of times she has lapsed when it comes to family allowance is revealing.
Here, Merkel needs three startups to pronounce a half-precise sentence.
She's staggering in unknown terrain, from the moment it becomes concrete.
The Attack Branch
In the Youtube debate of Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney are engaged in a tough offensive battle - and must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already breaking on the first subject.
He reportedly made New York a "safe haven for illegal immigrants," accuses Mitt Romney of his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
The latter, for his part, opposed by heavy reproaches: "I would say that his own house was a haven for illegal immigrants," replied Giuliani and reproached the former governor of Massachusetts for having employed undocumented immigrants.
The candidates rise to the attack: since the Republican base also has no official favorites, the eight presidential candidates use CNN debates primarily to discredit their opponents.
The 30-second amateur films that Internet users have sent via Youtube are hardly more than blowers.
"It was with this kind of isolationism that we let Hitler come to power," said John McCain to his candidate Ron Paul, who was the only one in the round to call for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong lesson from Vietnam's veterans when he refuses to condemn what is known as "Waterboarding," an interrogation method that simulates drowning, as torture.
However, the fact that the important themes of the campaign go in the meantime beyond the war in Iraq and debates on torture can be seen in the reactions of the St. Petersburg common hall in Florida.
Whether conservative values are being praised or future tax increases are being denied, applause flows through the auditorium.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites are once again revealed.
"I made a mistake at that time," Romney contrited and apologized to the base and the television audience for having been a supporter of abortion again in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, passes through a noose when asked about literal interpretations of the Bible.
Musharraf reigned for the first time in plain clothes.
One day after his withdrawal as leader of the armed forces, Pakistani politician Musharraf was invested as president.
So eight years of military domination come to an end.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was invested on Thursday for a new five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace of the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and to act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday he had passed on his post as Chief of the Army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, and had thus responded to international pressure, including that of the United States.
Eight years after taking power by a bloodless coup, the former general now reigns for the first time as head of civil status.
By this withdrawal from the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf had fulfilled the main demand of the opposition and the West.
Another central requirement was the end of the state of emergency that Musharraf had declared on 3 November.
Soon after his inauguration Musharraf will suspend the state of emergency, according to Prosecutor General Malik Muhammad Qayyum, and thus fulfill another requirement of the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, which Musharraf had occupied after the establishment of the state of emergency with lawyers from his ranks, had rejected last week all appeals against the controversial re-election of the Head of State on 6 October.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in the northern tribal region of North Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy, and four others were wounded.
According to the Army spokesman, a bomb exploded in a street near the Afghanistan border.
The fathers of Krauttock are coming back.
The German supergroups of the seventies replay: the three members of the Harmonia group took their console again in a concert in Berlin.
For their return they appeared recordings of their great success "Live 1974."
Already at that time, they were much better known abroad.
The expected sensation then occurs in the form of three gentlemen announced on the evening poster.
Everyone has his little box in front of him, his cable and above all his buttons.
Dieter Moebius, at age 63, sits in the middle in a white shirt like snow.
He is flanked to the left of 57-year-old Michael Rother, in possession of a laptop and a guitar.
On the right, observed by the entire auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, curves on his console.
Everyone contributes to the noise, among other things a Beat.
And sometimes it inadvertently adds to a piece of traditional music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
The fact that the group Harmonia plays again has ensured a few emotions among the lovers of Krauttock.
We have the right to reveal it here: targeted surveys reveal that, of course, the name is valid in the collective memory of pop, but in no case in such a lasting way that this group has been so painfully missing for 32 years.
But why would German not also have the right to celebrate its living legends of the seventies?
Especially since what is deceptively called "Krauttock" has rained ever more in England and America than in the country of origin.
When the music industry awarded the 2003 Echo Prize to the survivors of the Cologne Can group for their work, German pop faces were seen in the room as interrogators.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers also thanked the groups La Düsseldorf and Neu! in the panegyric praise, the astonishment was no longer limited.
Later, during the concerts, Michael Rother jumped on the Red Hot Chili Peppers scene like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and transfiguration in the unknown is the only one.
The memory is therefore already taken by Harmonia, because the trio only existed for two years and during that period the impact power that was felt was much lower than what was subsequently attributed to it by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had already played with artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name of Cluster.
We first played in the cellars below the Berlin scene.
Then in Düsseldorf, for a label subsidized by the church, for financial reasons.
Rother had briefly helped out in Kraftwerk and finally made a name for himself as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
Around 1973, however, Rother followed the musicians of Cluster in exile in the forests of Weserbergland.
There, in an ancient Weser farmhouse, a ruin of the 16th century, they lived as members of communities fleeing the city.
Less ideological than in the community "Kommune I," where Roedelius had the right to be tormented as a nurse.
Rather an artistic existence like Spitzweg.
Saying that there was in the trash a fanion of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein and also a name for art.
Many kept Harmonia away from this.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia," and the next "De Luxe."
For as serene and modest as the music sounded, the group suffered from material misery.
The harvest of dead wood was not alone in the search for oneself.
The "Live 1974" CD that just appeared was recorded at a concert in Griessem in front of a record audience of nearly 50 heads, as well as someone thinks he can remember.
Rother issued at that time the wish to force Harmonia to train from time to time.
This was an immoral requirement for Roedelius and Moebius.
The band announced its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the spheres of esotericism and assured his existence with albums like "Flammende Herzen" (hearts in flames).
Cluster revived in the eighties and has since more success than Harmonia has ever had.
We owe Griessem's live album to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His Grönland label has set itself the goal of maintaining Krauttock as an inherent German contribution to contemporary music.
Neu! had already been excavated on this occasion as the personal work of Roedelius.
Harmonia's physical resurrection took place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
Publicly sponsored, as part of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is there, the British, former punk and author of the pocket book "Krauttock Sampler."
There's also the inventor of the Loveparade, Dr. Motte.
By which the entire margin of fluctuation of Krauttock's influence would be identified with respect to future pop music.
The space left empty by the group will be filled by Harmonia.
Brian Eno's sentence hangs in the room in the middle of the singular sounds: "The only real music, you listen to the future."
There are pictures that show producers with Harmonia in the farm room.
Projections of other black and white pictures of bazaar-wired tools are used to form the legend.
In front, the three veterans are again busy improvising.
But more by sticking microphones to the organ and battery, to draw unheard of sounds to the instruments thanks to the instruments with effects built on themselves.
Today, electronic music resembles electronic music.
The three in great technical thumbnails.
To this very choir of the house will not change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, we cough and whisper under the cloud of sounds, and sing at a nice moment "Aaaaaaaah" with emphasis.
Krauttock has always been a very English concept.
It's never been about rock.
The roots were less sought in blues than in music conservatories (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or in the escape of artistic or social conventions (Cluster).
He who cries "68" is not totally wrong, and Harmonia is no longer being irritated by this from now on.
But what is most self-evident will be covered meticulously on the stage.
Where does the music start and where does it end?
This can hit someone's nerves (?) or give fugacious moments of great joy.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough.
With "The Hunting Party" and "Murderous Peace," two films again address the Balkan war.
But both of them don't convince.
Either the projects are too action-driven and the senseless exchange of fire, or they are too burdensome.
Here, even Richard Gere in "The Hunting Party" can't help.
The good news first is that the war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but it is there, in the most lugubrious hinterland of the Bosnian war, that actor Richard Gere is then found.
We had in the last place lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties, because far too many nice and futile roles in films with feelings for women and far too many press conferences on the theme of Buddhism delighted him with the desire to show himself.
Today Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument to watch "The Hunting Party" - when the hunter becomes the hunted (why do today's films have to be as long and confusing as collective agreements of locomotive drivers?)
He delivers a magnificent representation full of clins of eye: deep down, his character as war reporter Simon Hunt is what Gere could have become, if fate and the film industry were not so benevolent: a man who has had his best moments long behind him, but who, even as a ruined monument to his decline, has nevertheless kept visible remnants of his old charm.
But despite this asset, "The Hunting Party" continues together with the German production "Murder Peace," which also comes out this week, the endless sequel of failed films about the Balkan war.
From "Murderous Peace" one can quickly make the trial: the film speaks of two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt), who save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, in which one of the two still quickly falls in love.
Although it is welcome that the Serbs are not presented here for once as the sole cause of all evils, this film as flat as a telefilm is lost far too fast in action and senseless exchanges of fire.
It remains a kind of "Cobra 11 Alarm" without highway but with a war instead.
On the contrary, we can examine in the perfect example of "The Hunting Party," why basically there was never a real good film about the Balkan war.
The story of the three American war reporters, who conditioned themselves to track the high war criminal "the fox," could perhaps have become, together with another director and another screenwriter (both Richard Shepard), at another time a new "Apocalypse Now."
Because the stories resemble each other in a striking way: two males go into the forest as a small team, to accomplish something that the military cannot do, and for both males, it becomes a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is simply not allowed to be the deserted cynic with a heart, as is presented to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also attribute to her a romantic adventure with a Bosniac who was later murdered.
Then "The Hunting Party" becomes definitely bad, when the reporter, in the last five minutes, by an accelerated process, manages that NATO, the CIA and all the bounty hunters of the world have failed in five years: to catch the war criminal and leave him for just revenge to the Bosnian Muslims.
It is so bad that it should be brought before the Hague International Court of Crimes against Film Logic.
In this case, the film has too deep a human concern.
He wants to denounce that Karadzic and Mladic are still at liberty, and he suspects the Americans and the French (here they must exceptionally agree) not to conduct the hunt quite intensively because of secret political agreements.
But the well-intentioned and the wicked are so similar this time that a famous poem by Brecht comes to mind.
He speaks of a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the poet's work table: "Compassionate, I see the veins of the forehead swollen, clearly: how exhausting it is to be mean."
Movies like "The Hunting Party" have exactly such tumor heads, but they suggest how tired it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of films about the Balkan war.
Recently, it was reported in this newspaper that all Hollywood films about Iraq were big flops.
One can add: there has never been a good film about South Africa before.
This is worth every time: when a star hangs on a crisis home or a minefield, he then comes out something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette, "Jenseits aller Grenzen" with Angelina Jolie or "Blutdiamanten" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
It is possible that all these conflicts are still simply too close in time.
In any case, decades have passed before Hollywood could make a good holocaust film with "Schindler's list."
Some films still need to mature - those that are now worth classical works on Vietnam "The Deer Hunter," "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" were never unanimously celebrated in their time as masterpieces.
But maybe we also know today just too much about the conflicts of the world, where each hecatombe arrives live on two screens at the same time at home,
And this thrills writers for the lack of scruples they need to tell beautiful stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The dictator" have actually become as good also because Lubtisch and Chaplin did not yet know how much the Nazi regime really dominated.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps we should have the sarcastic and distant artistic look of the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Dictionary of Prayer" and the Balkan War, he replied, "It's only because some things never change."
"The big cities will always be horribly dangerous, men will always be murdered in a horrifying way and war will always reign in Yugoslavia."
Von Beust collected the criticism for the cancellation of the Olympiads.
The mayor's setback with Hamburg's candidacy for the Summer Olympics was met in politics and economics with virulent criticism.
Many want to continue fighting for the Games by the water.
But Von Beust calls for realism in the assessment of opportunities.
The Senior Director of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, described a abandonment on Wednesday as "bad for the local economy."
In recent times, no other project had deployed as many motivational forces in the city as the idea of the Olympiads.
"Without this objective, the political-sporting momentum could not have been maintained in the same way."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to bury the project, but to find a new, longer-term starting point, "which takes another modified agenda as a starting point."
Mayor Ole von Beust remained on Wednesday with his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions were unrealistic at least until 2028.
"It is not Hamburg that decides to run for the Olympics, but the German Olympic Sports Federation," Von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the expected decision of the Sports Federation at the beginning of December on Munich's bid for the 2018 Winter Games.
This preference means for us that, in the time that we had planned until 2028, we will have no chance. "
However, the dream does not definitely belong to the past, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regretted Beust's statements.
From this the impression would be given that Hamburg no longer wants to apply for the Olympic Games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to close an opportunity by burying the projects already now," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
An abandonment of the candidacy would also be in contradiction with the statements of the head of the Senate on the occasion of the hosting of the German Federation of Higher Schools of Sport in the Plenary Assembly.
There, Von Beust reportedly described Hamburg's candidacy for the 2015 Universiades as "not a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
The Federation of Higher Schools of Sport had first named Hamburg as the candidate city in the past weeks.
The SPD faction of the mayor criticized the Senate for not using this valuable time in building housing in Hamburg.
"The development of the Petit Grasbrook was denied by the Senate for years because it played the Olympic card and excluded housing construction," said SPD delegates Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD has always called for the Petit Grasbrook to have an integrated plan in the Olympiads and a subsequent use of housing, the CDU would have relied exclusively on the "Event factor."
The candidacy for the 2012 Summer Olympics would have been very enthusiastic in Hamburg.
However, Hamburg had broken against Leipzig.
They're not Warhols' crates.
The one who connects the Swedish concepts with the wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or do you?
At the moment, wooden boxes made in Sweden are throwing shadows on Warhol's list of works.
A large part of the ninety Brillo-Boxes of "Stockholm Type" listed there are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" questioned the authenticity of the Brillo-Boxes of the year 1968 by Andy Warhol a few months ago, the internal research of the Moderna Museet of Stockholm today leads to a disenchanting result: the six "Brillo-Boxes," of which the former director of the Pontus Hulten museum made a gift in 1995 at the Moderna Museet, are copies - as well as a large part of the other hundreds of Brillo-Boxen of "Stockholm Type," circulating on the international art market.
The ancient history is entangled, a disconcerting chain of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964, Warhol created its first "Brillo-Boxes," painted wooden boxes in New York, based on the red-blue-white design of "Brillo" powder soap boxes.
An exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet presented in 1968 - with the agreement of Warhol - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard: These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but had been delivered directly from the Brillo carton factory.
These were not works of art here, but rather their models, exhibition samples.
At the same time, Warhol had given permission in 1968 to have some Brillo wooden boxes produced in Sweden, which were not exposed to the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses of the time speak today of about fifteen wooden boxes that at the time would have entered the history of art and auctions, as the original Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol authorized, with the name "Stockholm Type."
Some of them reached more than $100,000 in auctions.
The problem now is that the legendary director of the Pontus Hultén Museum falsely claimed later that about a hundred wooden boxes had been produced and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol would then have transferred to him.
In truth, the 105 cases of Hulten were produced in Malmö in 1990 only, for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By that date, Warhol had already died three years ago.
Lars Byström, head curator of the Moderna Museet, examined three other Swedish private collections alongside the museum's six Brillo-Boxes, two of which were made in Stockholm in 1968: their laminated panels were first printed and sanded, then applied with a brush of white oil paint.
The texture of the copies that date back to 1990 reveals, on the contrary, that the paint was directly applied without a background layer on the laminated panels, using a roll of paint - and it is not an oil paint, but an acrylic.
"These crates were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official list of Brillo Boxes," says moderna museum director Lars Nittve: "If the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come another decision, the moderna museum will classify the six crates in its collection as copies / exhibition material."
Already in July the Authentication Board announced, of course, that it would investigate the "heavy charges" that will be raised in the case of powdered soap cases.
But since then, we've been awning there with inexorable silence.
The Rebel Soldiers of Manila Abandon
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers are abandoning, the same soldiers who had fallen into a hotel in Manila and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Chief Antonio Trillanes, who accused the President of corruption and electoral fraud, told reporters in the hotel that he could not answer for any bloodshed.
The soldiers loyal to the government had shortly before stormed the hotel with tear gas.
The two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
About half of them were in court on Wednesday due to a failed putsch attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He took advantage of the audience to suddenly eclipse with about 30 sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to be watching them, apparently deserted in his favour and joined his mutiny.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the withdrawal of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The loyal troops in power closed the area around the respectable hotel.
The President convened an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the action of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Trillanes said.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who commanded before the elite unit of the Scouts Rangers, said that other units of the army would soon join the march.
The regime's critics had called for a big demonstration against the President on Wednesday.
His government has been surrounded for months by accusations of corruption.
The financial district of Manila had already been the scene of the attempted mutiny of about 200 army members against Arroyo since 2003.
The insurgency broke almost 24 hours after the army refused to join.
Since 1986 there have already been at least seven attempts at putsch against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a principal shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet has secured more than 20 per cent participation by the telecommunications company Versatel.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as announced by the company on Wednesday.
Only 20.05 per cent of the share capital would be held.
We had previously speculated on a buy-back.
The option would remain open to further increase participation in Versatel.
With this step we seek to accelerate the consolidation of the German market for DSL, United Internet said.
Just before, assumptions had already been made on Wednesday about an entry, after the bank Berenberg increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator from 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
The credit institute would only hold the money for a third part, it is said on the market.
The previous day, United Internet had already acquired a stake of nearly 10 percent in the mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch placed 17.4 million new shares worth €106.4 million on the stock exchange.
United Internet bought 5.15 million for 31.1 million euros.
In addition, the companies have opened negotiations on co-operation in the marketing of DSL and mobile telephony products.
"We're strengthening our partnership," explained a United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies founded the company as an MSP shareholder in order to absorb the competitor Freenet.
For the time being, the two companies want to be satisfied with their ten percent stake in Freenet, and not to make use of their right to endorse an additional 18.49 percent in Freenet, confided United Internet on Thursday.
However, both companies would be open to all options, especially to increase participation in the Freenet SA, it was learned.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership had ended in mid-October.
The poker still difficult to predict on Freenet, which has lasted for months, is part of the consolidation of the German telecoms market.
Freenet had at the end of the third quarter 2.9 million customers bound by a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million DSL customers and full subscriptions.
United Internet Holding and Drillisch held a direct stake in Freenet of 6.01 percent to date.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch would bring about an additional four percent.
The right to purchase the 18.49 per cent of the Vatas investment company had already been decided in August.
