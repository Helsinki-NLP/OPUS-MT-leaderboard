What's going to happen? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor pastry in Prague.
The new CSSD elected representatives at the city hall of the capital will apparently have to overcome a real language barrier in order to understand themselves at the municipal council level with their old and new ODS colleagues.
The daily Actualne.cz "tested" the new members of the municipal council belonging to CSSD, namely whether they know the money that was born in the last few years at the town hall, when it was the partners of the current coalition that were leading in Prague.
The coded vocabulary that Prague's political cream set in motion during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis.
It was with surprise that it was discovered that the new elected officials did not fully understand the known terms.
At least they say so.
"Who's Valdemort."
"I really don't know."
"I am a young man in the politics of Prague," said Lukas Kaucky, the elected member of the culture in the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather."
And as far as the political veteran is concerned, the elected Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the meaning of "golf hole."
"This is the only expression among the ones you propose to me that I use"
Otherwise, I don't use silver.
From the vocabulary, of which the daily Aktualne.cz published the expressions in June of this year before the pre-electoral congress of the ODS, the editor chose 6 examples, primarily those related to the city hall of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the meaning of "Voldemort," "the biggest golf hole in Prague," go to the pastry shop, "" beef nerve, "" betrayal of the capital "and" entanglement. "
Three of the elected officials agreed on the quiz, the fourth - Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an interview but then did not pick up the phone.
The fifth elected Petr Dolinek totally refused the test.
"I am not dealing with these things at all and how the representatives of citizen democracy are entertained: I will not give my opinion."
"I am currently dealing with how we will understand each other in our programs," he responded.
As has already been said, elected Lukas Kaucky would not apparently recognize in the above legend that he is the influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of former Mayor Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the biggest golf hole in Prague."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," Kaucky said, and immediately added, "But I know it from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to buy a language course," he laughs.
Not only the matador Karel Brezina, but also Lukas Plachy, the environmental leader, know that the golf hole is the Blanko tunnel.
The two Social Democrats know who Voldemort really is and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks of the meaning of "going to the pastry shop."
"It's about going to a company, I think," Plachy is ready to guess that it's Janousek's headquarters.
On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws his knowledge rather from newspapers and not from any vocabulary he would use.
According to the candidates for the tests, there is no lexicon of silvery in social democracy.
"I've taken advice with colleagues and it appears that we really don't have something like this."
"We say names to each other sometimes we use abbreviations and symbols," says Peter Hlinsky, President of the Social Democratic Party, who the party members call Hulda.
"I was called Briza at school but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," says Karel Brezina about nicknames.
The daily Actuel.cz tested the name and it works.
The elected Weinert is Papy for the members of the Party or the less friendly Little Old, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by scams during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy."
The nicknames are also the only ones that social democrats admit to use within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky does not like to hear Hulda much, but the daily Akutel.cz has recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
"Doctor of Matrac Law" reportedly recalls that Petr Hulinsky obtained his title as Doctor of Law JUDR.at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to reduce the torture of "witches," published a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, women declared witches have common features.
They are rather part of the old generation, cannot work for health reasons, are free and have no children.
The one that becomes "witch" is isolated so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"Man rarely has that destiny."
"Young women are also not judged to be healthy because they participate in work and give birth to children," says a sister who works in Burkina Faso's West African capital, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government has decided to intervene against this unusual "social measure."
He has published a pamphlet that should help limit witch hunting.
The case has a "hic."
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso don't know how to read," the daily Die Standard warned about the disadvantage of written education.
The accusation of witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, a neighbour of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a 72-year-old woman died after being tortured by three women and a man and then burned with oil that they had sprayed on her.
It was the BBC server that transmitted this information.
The criminals say it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil used for ritual onctions became ignited in contact with the woman.
The oil flamed, it seems, when the team wanted to "drive away the evil spirit" of the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is approved by people of all levels of education.
The daily Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eating human spirits has always been a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso is working to reduce witch hunting, the Gambia is no later than last year when the President himself participated.
"The Gambian President Dzammi, after the death of his aunt, launched a wide-ranging witch hunt which, it seems, would have participated in his death and would have endeavoured by black magic to kill the President as well."
"Shamans from nearby Guinea came to the rescue, brought to the presidential farm in Kanilai, under the protection of police officers and the personal guard of the President, randomly selected men and women from villages in the Gambia," said the organisation "Amnesty International.
At the farm the imprisoned people had to drink a herbal potion with hallucinogenic effects which also caused other effects on the kidneys and intestines.
Two prisoners did not survive.
About a thousand people were released from international pressure.
The tenant of Bakal: The poeles heat up, he signed a higher rent.
An imposing elderly man came out through the customer centre door of RPG Byty's "coal baron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments for rent in the Czech Republic.
He was carrying a file with three new rental contracts for three apartments: his own, that of his daughter and his son who is serving a sentence.
The deregulation has increased the rent for these three people.
Instead of paying 3500 the son will have to pay from next year for a 2 + 1 apartment of second category 4100 crowns.
"And there is no hot water and the heating works with solid fuel," points to the new contract of his son the man who has signing power.
"But I signed anyway," he explains with anger and half resigned.
The citizens' association of BytyOKD.cz apartments, which described the new rental conditions as "immoral and indecent," advises tenants not to sign and wait until 7 December, when a notice will be published explaining the method to be followed to claim.
But man reacts to it with a gesture of his hand.
"One says that, the other says something else" frowning.
The Ostrava region became the laboratory of deregulation.
After the New Year, this is what awaits most apartments in the Czech Republic whose rents do not match the market price.
Aktualne.cz therefore decided to personally visit the "laboratory."
The RPG waiting room on Havirovska Street is one of the four in the Ostrava area and is already full on Tuesday at 9 am.
Right next to the door is a guard of a security company with a device to call the customers.
A special button, "rent 2011," is on the touchscreen.
One pressure and one paper with a number comes out of the device.
You don't have time to read your number "157" that your number is already starting to light up on the big screen under the topit of the waiting room.
In a fraction of a second it's your turn.
After a short moment, an old couple arrives to find out about the rent, but the new rents don't seem to concern the people in the waiting room.
The majority of people have come to solve common problems like everywhere - demand for repairs, insurance events and so on.
In the Ostrava area, people from over 44,000 apartments in the portfolio of RPG have been receiving mail with new lease contracts in their mailbox since about mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes rent increases of 15 to 38 percent.
the special window for new rents has been open to the public since 18 November.
"It's been running for almost a week, so it's still on trial," replied, after a moment of hesitation, the employee behind the counter when the client introduced himself as a journalist.
The derangulation and the former apartments of miners in Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The vice-president of the parliament from the Ostrava region Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats reported this in a fairly sustained manner before the elections and this now fills the local newspapers.
"20 years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change me a plank... n in the wc, relieved himself in the introduction of the mentioned man.
However, it is mostly, according to the employees, retirees who come to be sure that they will receive a discount on the new rent price if they sign now as promised RPG in a special offer.
This is a rebate of half of the rent that other tenants who have signed their new contract before December 15 will receive.
But the "deregulation" window on Havirovaska Street is really not overwhelmed by the questions.
"Of the 360 clients who came yesterday, only 40 to 50 came for rent," says the employee at the counter.
And yet RPG carries both on its website and in the windows individual interviews on rents when necessary.
If both parties do not agree on rent, the decision will be made by an independent tribunal.
"These are not threats but only to inform about the unique and legitimate way to act legally," RPG says on its website.
"Here no one will go to court" thinks one of RPG Byty's employees and the man in the street in front of the customer center makes it right.
"I have 13,000 retirement crowns and I have 5,000 crowns left to eat, I don't have enough to go to court," he says.
The employee suddenly feels uncomfortable.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media asks that no one sign and therefore the people wait," she says.
Rent regulation ends in the Czech Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic necessity.
"And, moreover, the current rents still do not reach the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimes, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, that it is precisely the neglect of the housing fund that makes the tenant angry is the main reason for the rent increase.
However in 5 years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could with the rents invest in the apartments 4 billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hung on the ceiling in front of the upholstered armchairs of the waiting room on the street Havirosvka, however, repeats some information indicated in red.
'The rent increase in 2011 is 15 per cent and concerns no less than 31,200 apartments or more than 90 per cent of RPG apartments. '
"And it will always be at most 7.50 Czech kroner per m ² per month," says the screen.
The 38 per cent increase concerns only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio.
"In these cases, this is an increase of a really very low sum 19.66 Czech kroner to m ²," adds RPG.
Next year the rent will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not lead to a radical but gradual increase over 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money from the rent increase (see graph) is returned to the apartments in the form of heating savings - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the rent increase agreement have priority.
The nursery school is also part of the offices including the architects.
The Avriopoint administrative building of Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch. Design.
No one could have expected it to also house a mini nursery school with everything - color walls, imaginative furniture, toys and finally a miniature playground on the terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch. design employees can go there.
The architectural project company Arch. Design. whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, has imagined its mini nursery business school since the first drafts of the Avriopoint building.
It employed about 90 people, especially the age of children, and it was important that women architects and project managers should be able to return to work quickly.
Along with reduced-time employment contracts, the nursery school is a bonus offered to its employees by the company Arch. Design. as part of its social program.
Manufacturers and architects thus have the opportunity to combine work that takes care of children.
It was the employees of Arch.Design.themselves who conceived this nursery school and with the support of the management they were able to obtain an endowment from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The mini nursery school is financed by the European Social Fund through the operational human resources programme and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding (up to 2.8 million Czech kroons), they were able to buy equipment and equipment and after two years provide qualified staff and start up.
After the use of the funding endowment (two years) the company Arch. Design. has an obligation after 3 years to operate the mini nursery school from its own funds.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and it was Economy rating that helped to apply for the staffing.
Child care is provided by qualified staff, a nurse and a kindergarten teacher take care of children all day long. Children can go to nursery school without age limitation, but they are over three years old for the most part.
As it is a "mini nursery school" there can only be 5 children present at the same time, but during the day there are more who are replacing each other.
The operation of the school is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school without regard to the hierarchical position.
Although individual care and education are provided, the curriculum of the mini-nursery school is comparable to that for pre-school education.
Children are not only playing but also providing quality teaching - from the beginning to preparation for school schools, English is taught.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative toys and games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of small children in society creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents may at any time control their child and do not have the stress of being delayed to pick up the children in a school away from the parents' place of work.
Parents therefore use their working time in the most productive way.
It is not surprising that there is a natural relationship of loyalty between the employee and the employer.
Arch.Design.has thus registered among the companies that offer a bonus of choice for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly to the family and through this program strengthens the marketing of HR.
The bone house still fascinates after 100 years. Take a look in Gaudi's interiors.
The roof resembles the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase with a dinosaur spine and the balconies with open fish gules.
This is the Casa Battlo house in Barcelona by architect Antoni Gaudi.
Due to its organic forms, the house was given the nickname "Bone House" from the premises.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stones, fragments of tiles and mosaics, facade reminiscent of scales and everywhere present of curves, this is all that is ypic for Antoni Gaudi's Art Nouveau.
The front façade of the house unfolds its dream lines, pleasant colours and textures that remind nature and animals.
During a more detailed observation we see the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision.
In the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such a way that the impression of brightness of the colors is strengthened.
The winding and twisting of the shapes also appears in the interiors with the same measure.
Wood is a wave copy of window frames, balustrades, door decorative elements, eyelet and slats.
The Battlo house, which stands in the Eixample district on Passeig de Gracia street at the number 43, was the result of the construction of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortes.
The reconstruction took place for two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another brand new one but quickly accepted Gaudi's idea of an unusual reconstruction and cheaper.
But the idea of Casa Battlo as a multi-dwelling house was not thought by Gaudi alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him.
It was precisely on his project that the decorations for an apartment representing the owner of the building and the use of mosaics for the façade were born.
For the façade also worked other artists and creators.
The joint work for the plans of Casa Battlo started with a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and Guell Park in which there are other works of Gaudi.
The locals nicknamed the house hot just after its finish because of its organic forms "the Bone House."
Others, considering the specific mechanism of opening windows, called it "the house that bails."
It is said that at the top of the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint George the patron of Catalonia.
Other building sculpture elements contain hidden religious motifs.
Gaudi thought for the house a system unique in its central heating time, with ventilation vents and typical chimneys.
Their 45-degree inclination seems odd.
During the creation Gaudi absolutely did not comply with the then construction directives and did not let themselves be obstructed by them.
At the beginning of the construction he obtained from the city the building permit, knowing, of course, that the data put on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years later during the finish the city council was horrified and asked for modifications.
For example, the members of the municipal council were not pleased that the building pillars were encroaching on the public sidewalk.
There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) for permission to rent the two highest floors.
The owner moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and on the third there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented to a jewellery store.
The entire six-storey house is shared by a staircase through which you can access to an independent roof terrace.
All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudi also worked on the modern concept of linking spaces.
The common part can be completely connected by opening the doors of the salons and the high society can communicate comfortably or confine itself to private space for more intimate interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi received besides new facades a non-traditional roof and two more floors.
Gaudi's play with light is also impressive, blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the inner courtyard and with the light wells.
The two-color game gives a maximum of light in all floors of the house.
It was enough simply to bet on the principle that white reflects more than dark which, on the contrary, absorbs the rays of the sun.
Casa Battlo House which was registered in 2005 in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund can be visited by everyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and splendid apartment accessible to the public.
The owners decided to take this step in 2002 on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
They continued the visits because they found it to be a lucrative undertaking and extended the scope of the visits to common spaces and attic including roof terraces.
The entrance ticket to the monument is really cheap and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have 20 percent discount.
The sum is still above the entry price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the residents of the building and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mattress and a spring: women have other criteria than men.
No ostentatious frame, but rather the quality of the bed area, so the mattress and the bed rest give a real basis for a good bed.
They must of course complement each other harmoniously to please a concrete user.
During the choice several things are decisive: weight, height, age, health status as well as the sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and spring are to be placed is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the country house where latex mattresses are not sleeping continuously, they are not suitable because they are slowly "warming up."
They also have a weight higher than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary to return them frequently.
If they also do not have enough ventilation channels in the heart and if they remain on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also form there.
The habit is also decisive in the choice.
Those who spend the light of time abroad where very thick mattresses are frequently used with a softening layer, will hardly feel well on a low and hard surface.
"That's how all the hokeyists coming back from NHL complain that they can't sleep there."
"For their tired shoulders, feet and ribs, they needed mattresses with a swollen layer of lazy foam."
"Such mattresses are also recommended for people suffering from diabetes who have a nervous system disorder which therefore ill assume" information "of the joints and skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That's why a few years ago the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers.
"Today everything works well, Tempur, the Italian Magnifex but also the Czech Tropico, for example, have suitable mattresses.
You don't need to be an NHL guy to enjoy a lazy foam.
This "miracle" simply works.
It optimizes its rigidity and shape according to the heat absorbed or adapts to the heat of your body.
Nothing puts pressure on you and you won't turn around in the night like after a tough game.
You're just sleeping better.
The lazy foam also works as a protection against squirrels.
To choose the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, about 21 / 34 cm.
A man and a woman of a size of 180cm therefore need a bed of 210 / 220 cm.
The minimum width for each one for a double bed should be 90 cm or 180 cm in total.
For single beds, for example singles, it is recommended to take at least 120 / 140 cm.
It's convenient in case of a visit.
'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on your back you should pose your hands comfortably with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Pailors and Decorators who has been dedicated for several years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and teaches it in specialized schools.
For a double bed each needs its own bed bed and mattress, so be careful during the purchase to choose the height of the mattress.
Otherwise you will only have to climb the spring at different heights and this is not feasible on all the bed frames.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, spring mattresses at least 15 cm, so count for the shape and aeration layer at least three cm.
"With touch or sitting on the mattress you should not feel the springs," warns Helena Prokopova.
Each mattress requires a specific type of spring.
The bed-bed, when the mattress and the bed-bed are united as Siamese sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses were very badly ventilated; it should not be washed, which is common today.
And since during the night it is normally sweaty from 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat it is clear that after 5 / 7 years, the mattress begins to remind a large (and clogged) sieve.
For this purpose specialists refuse to make a claim over a life of 25 years for a mattress or a lifetime warranty.
But everything to her but.
And for this, an expert advice from the vendors: for a 120 / 140cm mattress, give up hygiene or washing for the mattress coating, but instead add a protective mattress that you can easily remove and wash.
And even if nowadays it is common to make coatings with zipper for the whole set, that is, after opening one has two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) otherwise the handling for large models (and for one person only) becomes when they are removed a fight between a light weight and a heavy weight on a ring.
Do you have a stiff board in your bed instead of a spring?
Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for visitors for one night only.
However, equip the board (if there are none) with ventilation holes and use the spring mattress with a minimum height of 15cm with bag springs (from Germany Taschenfederken) and a ventilation layer.
A polyurethane mattress must not be part of such a bed.
For single-position slats with 14 / 18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps the combination of latex and coconut) are ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more slats, 28 and above, where the slats are doubled in the lower part of the kidneys and it is thus possible to regulate their rigidity.
For multi-position mattresses it is not necessary to take a spring mattress because it does not respond to the changes in position.
Alongside the adjustment of the stiffness of the slats it is also possible to install what is called a shoulder cradle.
This is a special connection of the slats that allows to pressure or even tilt the slats so that the shoulder of the sleeper "fits well."
For men who have "shoulders as wide as the back," this is really an important thing.
This thing is already envisaged by the mattress manufacturers who for "males" have started to use a softening area at the shoulders.
But they also think of women - they again offer them a softer surface at the hip level.
For the most difficult customer there are wing or platelet springs with what is called a multiforce suspension.
Pressure spreads into more points and spreads the tension.
But of course, be careful, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and air-swollen) on good mattresses and spring, the "plus" disappear.
The basic rule is a simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its tips must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinavians prefer by exmple.
When lying on the side, the pillow must level (with the shoulder cradle of the spring or the area softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses still have something in common with the first ones made from straw and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The trend is also with organic mattresses.
Petrol-based raw materials, from which polyurethane is produced, are replaced by natural oils, such as soya oil.
Almost all known manufacturers use soybeans.
"The Bio qualifier for mattresses means that the heart is made from natural products," explains Petr vasicek of Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used for mattress coatings; one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest or lavender fragrances.
There are differences between men and women.
While the birch plant extract so that the mattress coating absorbs heat and cools the body, "cools" man, the coatings "heats" women.
Red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is therefore warmer for the weaker sex.
The current favorites?
Mattresses made from cold foam (it has more pores with a disturbed cell structure so more breathable than the standard polyurethane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foams gives polyzone mattresses that know precisely where the head, lower back and feet are.
You will pay a quality mattress from 7000 crowns and over.
Those that are characterised by their health parameters have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex reached first place.
It is not easy to save for the mattress and the spring.
It is possible from time to time to have two mattresses in special actions by manufacturers or producers for the price of one.
Like for example Magniflex, which offers Duofreeze mattresses with memory foam sewn to the coating for 11990 crowns.
We can obviously take the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cell structure and a great thickness was started with Tempur material at a "cosmic" rate.
This began as a matter for NASA because astronauts were experiencing enormous load factors at startup.
Tempur grows warm and hardens in the cold.
It therefore adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes an optimal pressure to it.
For this it is ideal against sleeping ill and for an increase of comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses but also for health products, such as special foot cushions that relieve the legs and venous system.
For example, Czech manufacturers use EucathermC or Twinsaver foam or similar foam.
The devices to track people are increasingly being requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
Fear for their child is leading more and more people to think about watching them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search for cars, can also be used to trace the movement of people and to help in certain cases such as that of the little Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently as big as a box of matches but will soon be the size of a watch.
The case of little Anicka moved a large number of people and they began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even if the price is to disturb their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is not an espionage but only another way to reduce the likelihood of another tragedy," says Petr Pilin of the company Macro Weil, which is one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I admit that there may be cases of misuse of such devices, such as putting it in the bag of a person who is not aware, but I have not yet encountered such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons," says Pilin.
According to him, children should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
The child psychologist, Dana Bockova, draws attention that if the child does not want to carry something like this on him, he will get rid of it.
'And even the smaller ones can show great creativity when it comes to getting rid of something on purpose when they don't want to be under control. '
"Mobile phones, which can be cut like these tracking devices, have already brought parents to long expectations," says Bockova.
In her view, the fact that this type of device can help in the event of an attack is highly questionable.
"If it is a prepared abduction, the author will do everything possible to ensure that the child does not have an electronic device to locate it."
"Right now, it's the phone."
"As soon as the tracking devices develop, they (the criminals) will also be looking for them because the sale will be supported by an advertising campaign."
"In such cases criminals will always be ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
She admits, however, that such devices can help in an assault not prepared by a paedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, it is said that having this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of an assault.
"The device may be configured in such a way that it is in regular emission after a specified period of time."
"If the device is destroyed, it remains the last position of the person concerned."
"The more expensive devices also have an inclinometer that immediately signals the position of the person who slipped and finds himself in the elongated position without moving," says Cech.
According to him, so-called smart mobile phones that are equipped with a navigation system, can offer a comparable service after having formatted it with a special prosoftware.
The problem with current tracking systems is that it is either a device similar to those worn in pendants the size of a match box or to the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, this is why tests are currently being conducted to make devices that look like common digital watches.
"This will have the advantage that the possible attacker will not be able to recognize the tracking device."
"Or after some time, he will find out, which will have given the police a little more time," he adds.
Whether the tracking device is developed in the form of a bracelet or pendant, it will always use the same technology as to track cars.
This is a combination of GPS position acquisition systems (commonly used in self-rescue) and a mobile phone function that alerts the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so many detonating cords that it could go around the Czech Republic with it, but it can only last two years.
The army bought for 445 km of cords used for explosives.
Already last year the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km of them.
So the army has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the cords is between two and four years maximum.
The army bought detonating cords from STV Group for 40 million crowns.
The General Staff has given as a reason for the purchase of a huge amount of detonating lines to MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km of them a year.
According to the reserve calculations to be held by the pyrotechnics of the army, which MF DNES has contacted, it appears that even generals, officers with command, secretaries or household staff should have an explosive drill every year.
Alexander Vondra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army are no exception.
Only to argue the army's annual consumption of 60 km of detonating cords.
At this distance is 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were true, the army reserves could support it for 10 years.
If, on the contrary, it would be true that for the basic training of each of the new professionals it is sufficient at most 2 m of detonating ropes, as the experts say, it means that the army with its new purchase has assured - with also the consumption of special units and engineering - reserves for the 225 years mentioned.
Yet the soldiers of the Rapid Intervention Brigade have recently complained to Minister Vondra that they have almost no ammunition for their handguns and that shooting sessions are limited due to the need for money.
We're not talking about the lack of body linens.
"And I don't take my head if they buy so much detonating cords from us."
"And that's their decision and they really know what they're doing."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we as traders are trying to satisfy," says STV Group's commercial director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, argues that hundreds of km of detonating cords will be bought by the army for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, reports only four years of life of detonating cords and pyrotechnicians of the police and army of only two years.
"If they are perfectly stored in the repositories, it can go up to four years," says one of them who does not want his name to be published in view of the criticism of the army.
The life-span period passed, each munition must be tested to see if it remains intact and does not threaten the life of the soldier.
However, these tests are not free and still cost money.
The Department's other argument is a quantity discount for 445 km of detonating rope.
"They cost us 60 percent less than last year's supply of 245 km," says spokesman Pejsek, who interprets the views of the Ministry of Defence buyers.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of detonating cords of police pyrotechnics which neutralize munitions of the Second World War or those after the Soviet army, does not exceed 1500 meters.
And the police always only order the amount of ammunition needed to be used before the end of their lifespan.
This has been established for pyrotechnics' safety reasons and to be able to obtain more flexible and reliable types of detonating cords.
The Ministry of Defence today has major problems in neutralizing tens of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand men was preparing to move on the Rhine.
What awaits in a few years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of kilometers of old detonating cords that it buys today "cheap."
So far I have benefited from the contacts that I have obtained through the competitions.
The franchise sale of his hotel has helped Lukas Pytloun to win the Best Individual Entrepreneur competition.
The winner of last year's Best Individual Entrepreneur competition was Lukas Pytloun, a 28-year-old entrepreneur.
His adventure to success is like a movie.
Lukas Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad, he realized that in Liberec there was a shortage of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From his savings on what he had earned while working abroad and with the help of a bank loan he bought a small building of 5 half demolished apartments.
Knowing that he was still a student in the third year of higher education, it was a courageous action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of accommodation in our region has made me want to do something," says Lucas Pytloun.
He began to rent the first reconstructed apartment to the foreign workers.
He reinvested the profit in the building he converted into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, his entrepreneurial action has allowed him to open in Liberec 4 hostels, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of nearly 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year another of the same quality happened to him.
"We just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our franchise concept and other candidates for the Pytloun hotel franchise came forward," number 1 of last year's entrepreneurs.
"And for the sale of the license for the operation of a large-scale hotel the victory in the Entrepreneur of the Year competition served well," adds Pytloun with gratitude.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me in the streets, often congratulated me and, I must say, it was very pleasant," he recalls.
It recommends participation in this competition to all those who are trying to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He says he's been using his contacts and knowledge up until now that he couldn't have gotten in any other way.
"With those I met through the contest I started to maintain business relations regularly.
According to him, the reputation of success also had an impact on employees.
And he's about 70.
"I especially observe in them the loyalty and pride of being involved in something that has been generally recognized."
"This is not by far the only result of my personal work, but the result of good work by all of us together.
"Only my name is pushed forward," said Lucas Pytloun with modesty.
I wish my successor a better year than the one we had at Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was rightly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the goal of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind you.
The one who came to get the prize in Slovansky dum for the first place in the competition for the Firm of the Year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the company Farmet.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a tool shop in Ceska Skalice into a company with a turnover of 100 million crowns.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me my collaborators as well and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition," said the winner of last year's competition today.
At the beginning of Farmet's history there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered Karel Zdrasky's father to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few comrades in his father's entourage for the manufacture of plastic bathtubs.
Not very long after they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
After 18 years he became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company was known even in the non-specialized public after the success of the contest through the media.
"Not only did our customers start to really get to know the Farmet brand better, but also the foreign partners that started to realize that they were collaborating with a company that got the biggest success in its home country," says Zdarsky.
But the past year has not happened at Farmet only in the euphoria of victory.
The company's valuation was based on the economic results of 2008 and in part 2009.
And in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machinery.
At the height of the crisis, which did not really affect citizens, companies were forced to stop their investment projects and start limiting their purchases of new equipment and technologies.
"We obviously did not escape this situation."
"Turnover fell by 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even lay off," says Zdarsky.
A viable society must know that from time to time unpopular measures must be taken.
But they managed the situation properly and kept results beneficial even if they were lower than they had before the crisis.
However, at Farmet, they continued to invest uncompromising in research and development.
"We built with the endowments a training and research center, strengthened the company's presentation in international trade shows and won the main awards in national exhibitions," says Zdarsky.
Everything suggests that the crisis is behind them.
The numbers of posts go up and with them the number of employees also.
"To the new winner I wish this pleasant feeling of victory but in a calm atmosphere," says Karel Zdarsky.
The investigation that suppresses senseless regulations.
The Absurd of the Year survey is for the fourth time a part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be deleted.
The unglorious winner of this year's Absurd of the Year survey was the obligation to bring documents to the offices that officials can obtain on-line.
More than one third of the 4,000 voters voted for it.
For example, the social affairs administration requested a paper extract from the business register, whereas the official could obtain it in two mouse clicks.
It changes because of the investigation.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer ask for an extract from the Business Register for insurance payment controls," said Jana Buranova, spokesperson for the Czech Social Insurance Administration (CSSZ).
To highlight all the regulations and decrees that companies and entrepreneurs must fill in in the Czech Republic and to remove those that are absurd is the meaning of this contest of the Absurdity of the Year.
This survey is again this year for the fourth time a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske noviny and has even greater popularity.
If last year 3000 voters came forward, at least 4000 this year brought their voices.
And that's not surprising, there are in our country the most diverse legal obligations that only hinder the company, and that, more and more.
"We may be among the documents to fill out for tax returns in the first place in the world," says Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurial activity has become a stated goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving at all.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is 74 th in terms of conditions for the company, 8 more places than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first launched in 2006 and continues each year under the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic absurdities every year from April to the end of September, the last time before the competition is closed.
To report there is the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then, the contest organizer chooses seven candidates for the "anti-price" and lets the public vote during the month of October on the website www.firmaroku.cz / absurdita and on www.ihned.cz.
The Absurdity, which received the largest number of votes, was declared the winner.
Until last year's survey, it was about 100, or more exactly 105 regulations and decrees, that lost their sense of existence.
Comments are sent by contractors but also by trade unions and teachers.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, therefore among the nominees is for example the obligation that highway and fast track maintenance vehicles pay tolls, or that contractors with 20 employees paint two offices and two toilets every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the competition website.
The announcement of the contest, which always begins in early November at the Venceslas Square in Prague, is part of a meeting in which political and public figures regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for Small and Medium Enterprises of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the highlight of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work when the state is putting sticks in the hands of entrepreneurs and for this my objective is to remove, every year, at least three dozen paragraphs that today only complicate the business," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd decriminations is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of entrepreneurs to declare three days before the office for the sole proprietorship at the place where the company is located, the intention to go to an exhibition or a pilgrimage with a stand.
This obligation was abolished with the amendment of the Act on the sole proprietorship.
The second most widely cited obligation in 2007, to report to the Labour Office a 30-day duty trip for a foreign employee, was removed with the so-called Green Card Act.
And it's all okay until the third session of the contest.
The Absurdity of the Year 2009 was the decree for physiotherapists to have a large mirror in their cabinet, a refrigerator and two automatic scales.
This was changed by order of the Ministry of Health last year-the requirement to have a refrigerator was removed.
A new category rewards socially responsible firms.
Ecological, humanitarian, training and sports projects are evaluated.
The novelty of this year's Hospodarske Noviny competition, which has already existed for 5 years, is the category called the Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this competition is to provide reasonable and fair business support.
"We want to support companies that monitor their business's environmental impacts and conduct socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone operator, Vodaphone, who is the guarantor and promoter of this competition, as in the case of the rebel of the year competition.
For this first year of this subcategory of the competition of the firm of the year 2010, organized by the firm Vodaphone, have registered companies that have no successors with a single long-term objective for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich in inspirations and an independent article would be to be edited.
Although the purpose of their business is different from each other, their support and forecasting activity can be seen as the denominator of their efforts.
In one case, this concerns persons with disabilities and the personal or health problems of their employees.
Among the 14 finalists for the whole Czech Republic is not the Pragoese prosoftware company Et Netera which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournaments in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible for the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contributor to the endowment fund that sponsors children with disabilities for the past 17 years.
The old paper factory in Podebrad, which employs more than 70 per cent of its employees, has been awarded the title of Head of the Central Bohemia Region and placed third in the region in the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition.
In Olomouc, MiRyz Soft, a financial company, has won for having introduced flexible working hours and even decreased to 35 hours a week on average, without, proportionally, reducing wages.
The jury also rejected her title because she bought first and foremost from Czech manufacturers, supported a Ditoyan activity in the surrounding area and was concerned about the environment.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible so that our business activity and administration have the least impact on the environment," says Miluse Ryznarova, the company's executive director.
the responsible company IT Enlogit of the Region of Usti also thinks about the health of its employees and has put in place for each laptop an ergonomic chair and keyboard, encourages their work at home and uses the catering services of a local protected factory for its actions.
"We also support the foundation L'homme dans l'ombre that helps the local Roma community," said Ondrej Suchy, the representative of the society.
In the last place, also for its activities, is a cleaning and washing company in the Karlovy Vary region, which participates in the pension insurance of its employees in the form of bonuses above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transportation, increased qualifications and leisure," says Joseph Strapac of the construction company of Bruntal Czasch, winner for Moravia-Silesia region.
All the regional finalists for the Vodaphone Firm of the Year competition, who had completed the questionnaire as an attachment to the registration document and returned it to the organiser before August 15, were automatically registered in the Responsible Company category.
Incomplete or incomplete responses in the questionnaire were withdrawn from the competition by the organiser.
"If the representatives of the competing companies had not answered the questions, they could not participate in the competition of the firm responsible but were not disqualified from the competition" main "the Company of the Year of Vodaphone."
"Independent registration is not possible because it is a sub-category of the Firm of the Year main competition," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
At the Plzen Land Fund, police made arrests during a public competition
In the Land Fund building in Plzen, anti-corruption police have made arrests in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed the local entrepreneur and real estate trader Lubos. G.
The latter had endeavoured to precisely manipulate a public tender for the settlement of an application for restitution in such a way that the proposed land was obtained by a specific candidate.
He had to pay Lubos G. half a million crowns.
"For the time being I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for insider trading in the context of a public tender and concours." said for the newspaper Pravo the chief of the Public Prosecutor's Office of Plzen Antonie Zelena, knowing that it is forbidden to provide more explanations because the investigation is ongoing.
The police released the 46-year-old contractor after 24 hours.
In order to know how it could influence a public competition, one can only speculate in the light of so little official information.
On a question from Pravo, the spokesman for the Land Fund Lubomira Cerna said that the police had actually made an arrest in Plzen at a separate workplace during the public competition.
"It was a client and in no case an employee," she said.
The public competition according to Cerna has as its real name "Call to propose rights for the transfer of land according to the Land Act" and is put in place when several applicants who are beneficiaries of the law come forward.
"These persons propose, in the context of the appeal, a higher value of their rights to restitutions which must be settled before the value of the land is announced."
"According to the proposed rights a ranking of buyers is established and the Land Fund then transfers the land to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Fund's spokesperson.
Lubos G. had, it is clear, the information concerning the persons who had registered to the appeal and since he was also a beneficiary because he had bought a large number of refund rights, he had offered the candidates in the field not to participate in the competition.
And he probably cashed in by withdrawing.
Which would explain why he had so much money in his possession at the time of his arrest.
Lubos G. had contacts well above standards at the FdT (Land Fund).
He was in the case of the former FdT chief Vaclav Sankot, who was prosecuted in criminal proceedings for publishing land for which the decision to set up a construction had already been published.
Lubos G. had obtained, for example, land for the construction of public communications, in concrete place and place where the artery of access to the industrial area of Borske Pole was to be built.
Later he exchanged it with the town hall for a building in the historic center of the city whose value is far higher.
The town hall was forced to accept because otherwise it could jeopardize the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay a supplement of about 100 kroons monthly for housing.
Households will have to pay a supplement from January not only for all types of energy but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and in some places rents will also increase.
From January onwards, families will have to draw up to a hundred crowns monthly more than now.
Electricity increases by 4.6 percent, gas by almost 2 percent more expensive, in some localities you will have to pay up to a tenth more water supply and in many places central heating supplies will also be more expensive.
The increase in electricity is expected to be around 100 kroons more annually than at present.
However, all suppliers have lowered electricity prices in view of the significant development in encouraging the manufacture of renewable energies, including photovoltaic batteries.
Gas increases moderately but of course at a time when people need it most to heat and therefore have the greatest consumption.
So we can also count a hundred more crowns.
Although electricity and gas are increasing throughout the Czech Republic, the change in the price of central heating differs from city to city.
It is mainly the larger municipalities that plan the price increase.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Kraloce will pay from January for central heating almost 50 kroons more per month, families in Liberec will pay more than 1,000 kroons annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague is preparing a 9 per cent increase for water and sanitation if the city increases infrastructure rents.
If rents do not change the pragans will pay an additional 6.8 percent.
The price in Prague will still be among the lowest in comparison with the whole country.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sanitation are increasing by 7.4 per cent.
Rent prices will increase significantly, for example, in the 450 thousand apartments rented from January onwards, i.e. at the end of the regulation.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns in Usti nad Labem almost 2500 apartments, has decided an increase of up to 100 percent.
Those who disagree with the new rent increase will be brought before the courts by the company.
The regulated rents that people pay in nearly 300 thousand apartments could increase next year by 10 percent.
Czech children drink rum and fernet. Beer is no longer fashionable and acts gently.
Fernet, rum, vodka and exceptionally also the best brand of whisky are stolen from parents.
They are drinks that most often bring those who are drunk, who are not yet fifteen years old, into the hands of the doctor.
Children who are treated in hospital for recidivism are not the exception.
This is the result of the experience of doctors who encounter cases similar to admissions by hospital child departments.
"Beers or wines are no longer fashionable because it takes time to get drunk."
"The trend is really strong alcohols," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Head of the Children's Department of Horovice Hospital in Central Bohemia.
"When they manage to chew Dad's bottle in the cabinet, it's sometimes whisky, but it's the fernet and vodka that prevail."
"Vodka has the advantage that they can mix it with fruit juice and thus not feel it," explains the head of the department.
Eva Jurinova, spokesman for the Motol hospital, is also right.
"Usually it's rum or fernet."
"It is now the fashionable alcohol, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was a slivovice that they brought back from the house," Jurinova added.
According to the Head of Department Pelikan, seeing drunken children between the ages of 13 and 14 in hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since last year, he was in Motol where he worked for ten years in pediatrics, where ambulances brought schoolchildren from the surrounding areas completely drunk.
"A young girl was hospitalized four times
"She started her career at 12 when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol in the blood with a mixture with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"She was at Holesovice Exhibition Park at a party."
"What's interesting is that it didn't seem weird to the mother that her daughter was away for 48 hours," said the Director of the Department surprised.
It is the parents' disinterest or their extraordinary tolerance that their offspring engage in drinking that is the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
According to experts, however, there is no talk of dependence, in its strict sense, on children.
"Under the word" alcohol "one hears a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years with all the phenomena that result from it but are not found in children."
"Among those who use acool repeatedly, it is rather a significantly unfavourable socio-family back-ground," explained the Head of Department Pelikan.
According to spokesman Jurinova, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November at the paediatric clinic in Motol.
Only cases with gracious intoxication requiring hospitalization are included in the stastistics.
Children who are drunk after emergency care and are brought home by parents or the police are not counted.
In addition to the cases of children who sit and drink a bottle of alcohol after school, according to Pelikan, there are three seasonal waves with which one can count: the day of the witches, the Saint Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"Either they drink by spite after poor results or instead they celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"Of course I had an admission of 7 drunk children at once on witch's day," said Pelikan.
The drunken child who spent the night in the hospital in detoxification under medical supervision is paradoxically in a better position than the one who returned home and suffers the next day from the "hangover."
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are eliminated by infusion of glucose and nutrients that the body needs.
"They are better off because they have an excellent evening and then a gentle awakening and nothing hurts them."
"They are only amazed at where they are," adds Pelikan, knowing that from time to time it destroys the good mood of patients at least with the note to pay for their care.
Ambulance transport and intensive care hospital facilities can reach tens of thousands of crowns.
"From time to time, I used it as a means of education by counting on these children how much their drunkenness cost and that they could spend the whole summer in seasonal work to pay off a single evening," added Pelikan.
However, according to him, the health insurance companies in their regressive management, which should recover the costs of care from parents, do not deal with cases of drunken children.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands in Spain for the first time.
Two of the five L-159 aircraft, against which the Ministry of Defence exchanged Casa C-295M transport aircraft, took off on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where Casa-EADS aircraft manufacturer is based.
This is the first time that such devices have become the property of someone other than the Czech army.
They have, however, been abroad as part of exercises or demonstration flights.
These are the two-seater versions of the L-159T1 that were previously in service in the Czech army and were in flight status.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat versions of the L-159.
They are currently stationed at Aero Vodochody and the commercial intermediary - Omnipol - took them into account last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of the Vodochody aircraft is for the moment unknown.
'L-159 single-seat aircraft intended for exchange have been taken from long-stocked aircraft without causing additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence. '
"The L-159 T1 twin seats were exchanged in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He noted that the army will not be left without two seats, since the Ministry signed an agreement with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 worth 200 million crowns for the transformation of four unused L-159 single seats into two.
The army took delivery of the first aircraft in July, the second being scheduled for delivery at the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS committed to introducing aircraft into the equipment of some Alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the one that takes the L-159 aircraft into account is EADS and that they will be used for the training of pilots from NATO member countries."
"It is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to achieve this," Pejsek said.
Hospodarske noviny announced some time ago that the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for a Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was endorsed last year by Mirek Topomanek's government.
The Ministry of Defence did not tender and contacted EADS directly.
the defence management argued that the exchange ensures a future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army has purchased 72 aircraft from Aero Vodochody and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft will probably have judicial implications.
the European Commission has, however, lodged a complaint against the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because the aircraft should have been selected in a European-wide tender and in no case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa aircraft, the last one is expected to arrive at Prague Kbely airport in two weeks.
An index longer than the ring finger is a sign of low risk of cancer
Men who have the index finger longer than the ring finger are at a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our findings show that the relative length of the finger serves as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men before age 60," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
In this way, the finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, including by combining with genetic risk or other stressful factors such as familial antecedents, Eeles added.
During the 1994-2009 period she followed with her colleagues in Great Britain more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had the right hand index shorter than the ring finger.
For them as for the 19 percent of those with the same length of fingers, the same probability of prostate cancer was found.
For those who had the index longer than the ring finger, however, the risk fell to 33 percent, for men before age 60 the risk decreased to 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned - formed during the prenatal period - shows in particular different levels of sexual hormones to which the child is exposed in the uterus.
Unless testosterone corresponds to a longer index.
Previous research had shown that testosterone is exactly what helps the development of prostate cancer.
Professor Vacla Paces, a renowned Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, told CTK that he is aware of this study but that he does not seem to believe that the relationship between finger length and cancer is "fully demonstrated."
The Czech Republic is under snow, motorways D1 and D5 are closed.
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is this Thursday morning covered by snow.
On roads and sidewalks, most of the time there is compact snow, the excavators have worked all night in many places.
The D5 motorway is closed in the morning between the 89th and the 93rd kilometre in the direction of Rozvadov due to several truck and car accidents and the D1 auway in Brno in the direction of Prague suffers the same fate.
The Dispatcher of the Central Automobile Club (UAMK) told the news
In the 91st kilometer a truck was injured, in the 93rd two trucks hit each other, the accident caused injuries.
Several cars were also found in the ditch.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway at the 185th kilometer towards Prague.
Two trucks hit it.
Drivers should leave just after Brno in the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and then enter the 182nd kilometer in Kyvalka.
A multi-kilometre line of cars was formed at this location.
Also on the D11 motorway, there is an accident and, this, just on arrival in Prague.
In Prague, there is a layer of snow several centimeters thick, thermometers indicate - 7 degrees Celsius.
For example, lines of cars are being created in Prosek, Sterboholska Street is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are lagging behind, for example, on the line between Charles Square (Karlove Namesti) and Peace Square (Namesti Miru).
At eight o'clock in the morning the Prague crisis staff had yet to meet.
There are also problems with the railways and the airport.
The Czech Railways have already had to suppress 7 rapids because of the snow.
Lines such as Prague to Kralupy or Prague to Beroun have problems
Travellers should monitor the current situation.
Ruzyne airport has been closed since Wednesday 11: 00 am in the night until 5: 00 am.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already rolling but with increased vigilance.
On the road to Vyskov, three side roads are impassable, on the road to Brno there begins to be snow gusts in places and on the road to Blansko the chains are obligatory to pass some lines of communication in the places above.
The Vyskov region was one of the most affected places.
Until now the axes are closed: Rusinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and also Saratice-Milesovice
To clean them it may be necessary to send snow throwers and snow cutters.
So far, we can't estimate when they're rolling.
On the road to Hodonin caution is necessary in the region of the White Carpathians.
On roads that are, with regard to the protection of nature, maintained only by the spraying of inert products, there is still a layer of 5 centimetres of snow warning TKC.
In the Czech Republic, it fell between two and 10 centimetres of snow; it fell the most in northern Bohemia, often with up to 18 centimetres of snow.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, it fell to 15 centimetres of snow.
The snow is gradually disappearing in the Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "smart weapon"
The US army has sent a new "smart" weapon to Afghanistan, known only as XM-25.
The generals believe that this new automatic rifle will have an influence on the conflict there with the Taliban and "will change the game" for their benefit.
The new weapon is like a super accurate cannon.
Its projectiles are laser guided with a precision of a few meters.
The special 25 mm calibre ammunition developed for this rifle and containing a highly shattering explosive, actually works like small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed in such a way that it will explode in contact with the target and at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
It can therefore be used against an enemy hiding behind an obstacle, wall or ditch.
It is also not protected from above and when a deadly rain of steel splinters falls upon it, it can also put it out of combat.
According to Richard Audette, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier uses it essentially in such a way that he finds the target, sends him a laser beam that determines the distance, thus obtaining a precise point of view, according to which he corrects his site's aim and presses on the relaxation.
"Let's say you aimed at 543 meters."
"When you pull the trigger, the weapon loads and pulls at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus 1, 2, 3 meters," said Audette.
400 jobs relocated
Fujitsu Group is relocating its Bad Homburg subsidiary to Frankfurt.
Next year in July, 400 employees will transfer to Astro Park their workplace, which is currently located at the Mareinbader Square office building in the Bad Homburg area.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is moving its branch from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant who specializes in computer manufacturing and maintenance said on Wednesday, next year in July, 400 men and women's workplace, located so far in Marienbader Square in the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, a huge office complex located on Lyoner Straße Street in the Niederrad District of Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesperson explained that in the medium term, the group is expected to bring together another 100 jobs still scattered throughout the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive and Astro Park's open-space offices are better suited to the way employees work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just tenant.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said: "Frankfurt-Niederrad is a prime location with a remarkable infrastructure for us."
He claims that the connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company inside the region yesterday elicited the joy of the winners and caused the disappointment of the losers.
The Head of Economic Affairs of the Municipality of Frankfurt, Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "global actor" had been conquered.
It is an "extraordinary profession of faith relative to the place of implantation."
Fujitsu is suitable for the city and its location is an important boost for Niederrad.
The Mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (the Greens), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
Management informed the municipality of this intention at an early stage.
"It goes without saying that we have offered our help to this company," said Mr Korwisi.
However, friendly relationships could not have changed the computer manufacturer's difficulties with the owner of the Marienbader Square building.
Ultimately, the economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now a question of preventing such an exceptional place from remaining unoccupied for a long time.
"I hope the owner and lessor of the building will be cooperative."
Ten years ago, the building of Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, used so far by Fujitsu and the nearby "small vertical," as well as the rest of the buildings of Place Marienbad, were part of the controversial construction project of the spa.
The result of a joint project between the municipality and a private project developer, a new entrance to the city was created between the station and the Town Hall. This was a source of criticism, not only because of the impressive layout of the areas that used to be used partly for parking, but also because of the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment rating and consulting company, Feri, the computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and Fujitsu, a computer manufacturer at the time still associated with Siemens, moved into the buildings.
In 2006, the German group in Frankfurt specialized Immobilien-Chancen bought the buildings occupied by Fujitsu together with the Morgan Stanley real estate fund. A year later, these buildings were sold to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA based in Madrid.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu Group is considered to be the third largest supplier of computer products in the world.
For example, it makes computers and servers available to businesses and also provides the essential service.
Its branch in the Rhine-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu certainly has far more employees in Munich.
The branch, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to settle in Frankfurt-Niederrad. The other subsidiaries present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this, 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park building.
This 20-year-old complex, whose name recalls its star-shaped plan, houses, among other things, the headquarters of the Confederation of the Electronic and Electrotechnical Industry.
Amazon Expulsion of Server - Threats to Mr. Assange
Wikileaks is experiencing increasing difficulties.
The Amazon Internet Service Provider has evicted the website specialized in revealing confidential documents from its servers.
This attitude may hide the political pressures that have been sustained after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, is apparently staying in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is being attacked with ever greater force.
The group of cyber activists "Wikileaks" no longer has access to its server hosted until now in America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is wanted by Interpol, probably stays in Britain, according to news reports published by newspapers.
"Wikileaks excluded from Amazon server."
"Freedom of expression in the country of freedom," said cyber-activists at the origin of the revelations via the social Twitter network on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the cyber company, Amazon, had deleted Wikileaks' documents from its servers.
Following the publication of the secret diplomatic notes, cyber activists used the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to reach the greatest number of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks continues his revelations: "Wonderful, our dollars are now spent on caring for people in Europe."
When freedom of expression is a problem in Amazon, "they should stop selling books."
The CNN television channel, citing Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon banned Wikileaks from using its servers after the investigation by Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators.
The chairman of the Senate Commission for the Protection of the Territory had threatened the Amazon site to orchestrate a boycott against him, reported the British newspaper, "The Guardian."
"I would have liked Amazon to have taken this action earlier in light of Wikileaks' previous classified information publications," the senator said.
At the same time, Mr Liebermann called on other countries to refuse the use of servers by the platform.
"Wikileaks is acting in an illegal, monstrous and unscrupulous manner, putting our national security at risk and endangering life all over the world," according to an independent senator's statement.
"No company aware of its responsibilities, whether American or foreign, should assist Wikileaks in disseminating the content of stolen documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, who is wanted by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected of rape, is on the list of persons wanted by Interpol.
According to the London newspaper "The Independent," the 39-year-old Australian lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist has consistently described Sweden's prosecution as intrigues orchestrated by his critics.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson told London that threats have been made against the site.
"Calls have even been made for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange fears especially for his safety, said Hrafnsson.
This is also why the founder of Wikileaks continues to hide.
Hrafnsson clearly reacted to the statements made in North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, demanded that those responsible for Wikileaks' revelations be prosecuted and executed for treason.
In Canada, advisor to the Head of Government Mr. Stephen Harper stated on television, obviously ironically, that Mr. Assange should "be killed" and that Mr. Obama could "use a Drone."
Meanwhile, there was a controversy between the White House and Mr. Assange.
Robert Gibbs, spokesman for US President Barack Obama, described as "ridiculous and absurd" the fact that Mr. assange demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hilary Clinton if he was responsible for the order given to diplomats, and most recently disclosed, to engage in espionage activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to deal with the opinion of an individual who owns a website," Gibbs says.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than the assertions of a website."
The US government is now completely testing the protection of its databases.
According to a White House communiqué, Mr. Russell Travers, Deputy Director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed as the head of the Anti-Leakage Unit.
Mr Travers is responsible for putting in place "the necessary structural reforms" made necessary after the disclosure of diplomatic cables by Wikileaks.
The White House also has the will to verify the means by which the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
In addition, the US government has announced that it wants to deal with the safety of dissidents and activists if they are ever threatened by the Wikileaks revelations.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," said the spokesman for the State Department, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, ice sweeteners are prepared for the best seasons of the year.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from all over the world.
By the way, where did all the ice come from?
Glacier and the ice machine.
The glacier, in German the somewhat obsolete ice confectioner, makes the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice-making art.
The ice turbine removes the ice cream from the refrigerated window using a spatula, disposes of it in the waffle and then starts selling it.
To find out, you don't need to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But anyone who wants to know more about ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The sorbeteer manufacturer founded the ice university in 2003 to ensure that the ice creams from its machines meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day initiation course for future glaciers was very successful and attracted visitors from around the world.
There are also special courses on chocolate ice for several days, as well as practical sessions in the private ice shop.
In the midst of the quarantining crisis, a number of people dream of a new career, others simply risk realizing their ardent desire on smooth ice.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil through Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, a professor of art education from California, is passionate about the Slow Food movement. He wants to offer a quality European product in the country of Industrial Ice in the future.
Anke de Berlin is a consultant in business management and after a few years she wants to draw some singular conclusions from this difficult job for the nerves.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil would like to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian maid came because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice.
It is decisive not only the good flavor, but also the silky flexibility and the good consistency.
However, Luciano does not forget during the formation the cherry on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, from the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still retains a huge dose of romanticism."
The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixer that heats everything to 85 degrees thanks to an electronic program, and then immediately cools to four degrees.
He then opens a tap installed on the machine: a pasteurized base white cream, the foundation of all kinds of milk ice cream, comes out of it.
The trainer is immediately asked: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer?
How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of experimentation?
Mr Luciano warned against being misled by the spirit of time.
Those who speak only of ice "made from natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers: most often a natural product, such as guar seed flour obtained from guar bean.
It is obviously possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only it must be sold within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer will find nothing but ice pellets.
Some modifications of the base mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that one acquires in the fruit or confectionery department of the supermarket.
In addition, there is powder and pasta.
"the suppliers will all try to give you dozens of flavoured ingredients."
"However, you should just try."
Either in fruit sorbet recipes with sugar and fresh fruit.
Either in ice cream made from the white base mass which, by adding eggs to it, becomes a yellow cream and, when cocoa powder is added to it, forms the basis of all possible chocolate desserts.
Now, all participants in the course must move on to the use of ice machines.
Luciano invites them from time to time to make four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, moka and hazelnut with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
Different kinds of fruit ice are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree: from the point of view of taste, this is not absolutely better.
Hazelnut ice does not necessarily contain the taste of the nut, when it consists largely of hazelnuts.
Kiwi ice, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
"Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of ice," says Luciano.
The manufacture of ice cream is a calculation exercise: if you use fishing puree with a lot of sugar, the amount of sugar must be reduced in the basic recipe.
A sugar supplement is required for lemon ice cream.
Luciano presents an apparatus with which he determines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (the winemakers use it to measure the degree of Oechsle in grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make calculations easier.
The manufacture of ice no longer requires as much physical intervention as it used to.
It is not only the machine of automatic manufacture of the basic mass that helps.
There is also an apparatus in which the ice mixture available is simultaneously beaten to make it unctuous and reduced to negative temperatures.
Despite all the automation, minor breakdowns are not excluded.
Brazilian Gustavo shoves fruit puree from head to toe and, as a result, splashes his fellow students when control of the colossal mixing bowl eludes him.
Master Luciano is of the opinion that "such an incident is likely to occur during each course: it is only a matter of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to some sources, the industry that is experimenting with the cultivation of genetically modified plants has drowned the European Food Safety Authority.
This accusation is now made by the Testbiotech Expert Group, which is considered an independent institute for assessing the consequences of biotechnology.
"This sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we are well informed," said Mr. Christoph Then, Director of Testbiotech, in Munich on Wednesday.
There are reports that the chairman of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efsa experts are under contract with the Ilsi pressure group.
The latter is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestlé and Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has been instrumental in developing Efsa test requirements for genetically modified plants and is therefore clearly in a conflict of interest situation, according to Mr. Then's criticisms.
The requirements drawn up correspond verbatim, in paragraphs, to the positions taken by the Ilsi pressure group and thus bear the mark of the industry which, in the end, would be controlled by the authorities installed in Parma, Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has denounced a conflict of interest.
A senior Efsa official recently joined the Swiss agri-food group Syngenta unconditionally or without a transitional period. In doing so, she changed sides.
Not long ago, even Central German Radio (Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk, MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union's supervisory authority and the industrial lobby, which aroused suspicions from both the German Federal Environment Agency and MEPs.
However, the Efsa does not accept the existence of any conflict of interest.
An opinion indicates that all reliable data, including industry data, are being used as long as they are of good professional quality.
Experts working on behalf of Efsa are not prohibited from contacting this sector of activity.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he works for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) based in the United States.
It is seen as a neutral forum for science, industry and policy experts to assess the risks of biotechnology without being at the expense of a lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr Then disapprove of the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any animal feeding tests and that the impact of these plants on the environment has not been tested.
"We want to know what, for example, the impact of genetically modified maize causes in the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test only the isolated proteins and not the entire genetically modified plant, which does not allow reliable results to be obtained.
"If we don't look for the risks, then how can we find them?" Then wonders in an accusing tone.
That is also the view of Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
She has been conducting research in the field of genetics since 1994 and is currently working at the Zurich Polytechnic School.
In this region, as in the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry sector is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
For this reason, there are hardly any researchers who are not linked to companies.
In the view of companies, critical studies would not be published.
Ms. Hilbeck stated that "industry controls safety research."
The stone trace
Uli Gsell acquired some 400 kilos.
On Monday afternoon, she was in front of Stuttgart Station with her tube on her back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
History is known: By September, excavators had come and started to demolish much of the north wing.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: Several thousand people demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of Stuttgart Central Station into an underground station that will cost billions.
A large part of the wing was in ruins when the demonstrations led to the closure of the construction works.
Broken in 6000, 7,000 pieces.
The Muschelkalk (the cobble limestone) of Crailsheim, a tender and coarse pavement badly built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor residing in Ostfildern.
He got a few fragments of it.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He declared with enthusiasm: "a modest and cheap rock, simple and earthly."
He claims that by cutting it in the saw, he smelled the smell of cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he'll do with that fragment yet.
The rocks have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The traces of Stuttgart's stones lead to a former French army ammunition depot in a forest near Tubingue, where Manuel Rongen built his empire of stones.
This 44-year-old man is trading old stones.
He bought all the stones from the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were crushed or disappeared in the dump," he says in his office in a hut, which was once a guard post.
He says he was insulted and threatened when the newspapers reported in September that he had purchased the rest of the north wing from the demolition company.
But he negotiated for entire days with the opponents of the S21 project.
And he explained to them that he could do nothing to oppose the demolition.
And if it happens, then the most reasonable thing would be to continue using the stones.
About 200 opponents of the S21 project subsequently took one of the stone parallelepiped weighing an average of 80 kilos, the value of which is between 6.50 and 14 Euros.
Some keep it as a souvenir while also hoping to be able to return it during a reconstruction.
Rongen had acquired 500 tons, 25 full loads of a truck.
About half is still in the forest, the rest having been sold for a long time.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, Individuals.
They came from everywhere and took away everything that could enter the trunk and the trailers.
These Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into "Mäuerle" or the limitations of grass beds.
"By the way, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"had not been that political component."
He enters his all-terrain car, walks around his vast empire of 20 hectares.
He studied law and later began studying biology before becoming a computer scientist and eventually a carrier.
And a stone lover.
He's storing 40,000 tons.
He's gathering treasure all over Germany.
He claims that he is the greatest merchant of ancient stones.
He's reflexing.
Sand stones carved with art are laid on the snow.
"In the past, they were part of the Marienbrücke bridge in Dresden."
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, he says enthusiastically.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the path that goes up through the forest.
He shows a heap of finger: red sand stone, before, part of Karlsruhe station.
And so on.
"Nice travertine."
The parallelepiped was once part of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travertine from the prefecture of police, the reddish granite from the cathedral of St. Blasian, the tuf from the hospital of Heilbronn.
What work, what efforts, what sweat!
When Mr. Rongen thinks that the stones were once hand-carved and moved with simple hoists and carts drawn by oxen, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a heritage were destroyed."
He didn't get rich, even less rich.
But today this carrier employs 14 people. In addition, stone cutters, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glass blower and a gardener have settled in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's rewarding," says the waste recycler.
Next time, he has to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save, too.
Talent Struggle to Capture High Potential
The counter is very busy.
16 students rush to buy salmon buns, tomato sauce and white mangers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the car manufacturer Volkswagen invited the design and mechanical engineering students to a workshop.
As part of a kind of idea contest, they need to talk business about the car of the future with VW designers, and by the way, know the company Volkswagen.
Today, many companies do not hesitate to go to the competition in hand to find better brains and to engage, like Volkswagen, in a multifaceted cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most talented graduates as far as possible in the amphitheatre before they reach the labour market and are courted by others.
And since universities do not publish statements about the performance of their students, we try to identify exceptional talents in the context of practical projects and to retain them.
On the second day of the workshop held at the technical university of Brauschweig the automotive group amades the talents.
A young lady from the staff department shares pens, candy and cards with the Volkswagen logo.
She talks about the schedule of professional internships and student jobs for young talent; she shows them the paths to get to the group compound.
Nico Selle of the Braunschweig Technical University is responsible for the project with Volkswagen.
For him, there are mutual benefits for both parties: "Students come into contact with this industrial sector and gain experience."
"As for the Volkswagen group, it can know the students, take a closer look at the serious candidates and appreciate those who come into play as a collaborator."
According to Mr. saddle, such cooperation is unusual.
What is new is the offensive with which we seek to attract students.
"In the past, the focus was on the professional project," says Mr. Selle.
The struggle to conquer the new graduates will become much harder.
In goods in the sectors, companies can no longer recruit their employees by sorting out a number of candidates.
But they have to boast of their reliability and above all, they have to sell the highly skilled workforce.
It is mainly graduates from engineering fields who are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the German engineering association VDI, more than 40,000 engineering posts remained vacant in October.
And according to the VDI forecasts, the vacuum for engineering positions will grow further.
Roman Dykta goes on talent hunting for KPMG, an audit, accounting and consulting firm.
It organises expensive events aimed at recruiting talent, such as the KPMG-Race cruise race, a kind of paper rally where competitors have to find their way with GPS coordinates.
The company will send eight promising students next year to travel the United States in this way.
Participants may also visit KPMG's subsidiaries and know the company.
The person who has to take part decides in advance after two selection procedures.
Only the cream of the many candidates will fly to the United States.
According to Mr. Dykta, the means used to search for high potential in universities are becoming increasingly important.
"We want to emerge from the lot thanks to the cruise race."
"For us, a simple cruise was too little."
For the talent hunter Mr. Dykta, the count seems to be there.
"Until now, we have been in contact with all those who took part in a similar action last year."
"Some of them are in the process of completing their studies and wish to address their requests to our company soon," he says.
Apart from the direct amidst of the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises do so in a very traditional way by participating in trade fairs where they engage in the hunting of brains.
"We try to reach graduates by participating in trade shows."
"For example, at the solar technology fair," says Ms. Sitha Stübe, Director of Human Resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels.
This Bonn-based company employs about 1500 people in Germany.
Ms. Stübe was aware of the issue of succession.
At present, 35 posts are placed in competition on the company's website.
"At the moment, it is very difficult to fill vacancies."
"It's expensive and takes a lot of time," he says.
Another way to make contact is through university professors.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the University of Fribourg.
"Teachers indicate that the student has the opportunity to do professional internships or write his or her final study project at home."
Heavy advertising campaigns are being announced among solar specialists.
This is why the company tries to advertise by highlighting other qualities: personalized atmosphere, flat hierarchy and easy communication.
"Often a large group cannot do this," says Stübe, Chief of Staff.
Money has long since ceased to play the main role in job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for promotion are other determining factors.
According to a study conducted by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany's top 100 employers.
The Institute is an annual honour painting for German employers.
To this end, he asks employees about their level of satisfaction with their work and its context, while looking at the framework conditions of employees.
Chief of Staff Ms. Stübe hopes that this placement will enhance the image of the company among job seekers.
"I think candidates rely mostly on external evaluations for a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German Academy DEBA (Deutscher Employment Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies that wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr Kriegler, this means, above all, taking internal measures.
"The best way for an employer to be attractive is to go through their own employees," he says.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the employer's brand within its own workforce.
"satisfied collaborators form the best messengers."
When employees are treated well and they identify with the company, they advertise to their friends and acquaintances by themselves.
"It's like playing in an orchestra," says Mr. Kriegler.
Obama puts a stop to new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Florida, southeastern United States, in the years to come.
The Washington government has issued a ban An equivalent ban and thus definitively nullifies its original plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar made this announcement on Wednesday.
It is the explosion in April of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform that led to this strict ban, which must remain in force for at least the next five years.
Faced with this 11-person accident and leading to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and this industry, had indicated his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents of this solution want to reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign countries for oil supplies.
The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in golf is not, to date, definitively resolved.
The British oil group, which faces several billion claims for compensation, is at the centre of the charges.
A commission of inquiry set up by Obama is due to present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar lifted the drilling freeze after the platform explosion.
As a result of this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With stricter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster.
The competent supervisory authority, which has discredited itself after many accusations of corruption, is currently undergoing in-depth reform.
At the same time, Obama announced that they would eliminate the lucrative tax niches of gas and oil groups.
The players in this sector are now publicly warning against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be significantly lower than it has been so far.
"The government's objective is to halt the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a current survey in the sector carried out by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
Moreover, the American Enery Alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects have been postponed until further notice, to the detriment of growth.
The Ogoni country is dry
The water flowing through the rivers is oiled brown with a similar odour to that in the gas station: As a result of a leak, billions of litres of crude oil have destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live by theft, corruption and oil refining.
Celestine Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't be exhausted," the environmental activist told journalists to calm them: "You still have enough oil mud in front of the water lens."
The 37-year-old Nigerien tried to photograph a young man who was immersed in muddy water to the chest, as well as the fat drag that surrounds him: This scene seems almost beautiful in the glow of water in the color of the rainbow.
It cannot be seen that the basement is full of brown crude oil.
Esther Badom says on the Bodo-Jetty River that she used to collect shrimp in whole buckets here.
But in the meantime the calm waters have completely dried up.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil flowed out of a pipeline that exploded in the huge swamp.
Fishermen living in the nearby small town of Bodo must now row for six hours to reach the fish waters: The Ogoni country located in the heart of the Niger Delta is considered one of the most polluted regions in the world.
The extent of the ravages is obvious when the mangrove marshes are traversed by streams.
Instead of clear water, the motor boat splits a crackish brown water. Anyone who dips his hand takes it off all covered with oil.
The roots of mangrove pups emerge from the soil like licorice sticks. Isolated palm trees sadly let their palm hang.
Bird clouds are sought in vain, as is usually the case in wetlands: As soon as the outboard engine stops, a whimsical silence descends on this paradise of old, which looks like a service station by the smell it emits.
"What is happening here is a war on the environment," says Mr. Celestine Akpobari with a sad look: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger to health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where the Ogoni live has been besieged for decades: More than 60 years ago, the first European explorers entered the area; the first resistance was organized in the 1980s by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This one was later executed. In 1993, Shell had to interrupt its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Even today, the company is forbidden to return to the Ogoni country: While more than 2 million barrels of black gold are pumped daily thanks to more than 5000 drilling wells and 7000 kilometres of oil pipelines throughout the Delta region, three times as large as Switzerland, the oil fields of the Ogoni country are unexploited, because the situation there is too unstable for this oil group.
Every few hundred metres stand in the water of steel trestles as strange sculptures: The heads of drill holes are very affectionately referred to as "Christmas trees."
They are up to 50 years old, most of them are eaten by corrosion to the mark.
Akpobari believes that a drilling head of this nature breaks from time to time in pieces, as a constant flow of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres of oil have spilled into the ecosystem in 50 years: Each year, the amount of oil equivalent to that that that went into the sea during the accident of the super-oil "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago off Alaska, one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
Who should bear responsibility for persistent environmental pollution? The answer to this question divides the actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and siphoning of pipelines are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution. Environmentalists, for their part, regard drilling head explosions and perforated pipelines as the main causes.
In 2008, American researcher Richard Steiner criticized Shell for applying essentially less stringent safety standards in Nigeria than anywhere else in the world: Only the failure rate of pipelines is "much higher than it is."
Some forms emerge from the mangroves in a place that, seen from afar, resembles an abandoned workshop, full of cambouis and installed in the open air: They are completely naked and covered with cambouis to the neck.
A fire sparkles under one of the many barrels that sometimes connect to the pipes, sometimes scattered without any reason on the site must be spotted: a small underground refinery.
Crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours, says Michael, the team leader.
First, gasoline enters a container through pipes, then, at the end of the line, kerosene drops fall and diesel is finally obtained.
For example, Michael and his four collaborators produce four 300-litre diesel drums every day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira," about $22.
Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-producing country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
Illegal refiners can sell at a cheaper price than the ridiculously low price of just 40 euro cents per litre of Diesel: because they buy their raw material free of charge.
This is offered by the "protectors" who pierce the pipeline network throughout the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country loses at least 16 million litres of crude oil in this way throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a very insignificant small part of the raw material temporarily stored is illegally purified: Organized crime networks, which also include high-ranking politicians and military personnel, charge the lion's share in tankers and challenge it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers that the debate on whether to attribute the environmental disaster or rather subversive activities to the population or to the laxist mode of production is purely academic.
"If oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if the foundations of fishermen's lives were not so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, no illegal theft and refineries."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni relations especially with Shell have deteriorated to such an extent that it was only a matter of withdrawal from the group. "Perhaps operators of other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will prove to be better."
So Michael gets nervous.
"It's high time you got out," says the robust oil worker.
"Soldiers may appear at any time."
If the illegal refiners are surprised by the special units of the armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at most they will offer them bribes.
Even the soldiers mainly from the north of the country intend to take advantage of the raw material like all Nigerians.
"From any point of view, this damn thing has dropped our country down," regrets Akpori.
Investigators discover construction defects in A380 reactors
The A380 obviously suffers from a major safety problem.
In examining an aircraft that made an emergency landing, investigators discovered a possible construction defect that could lead to "catastrophic reactor failure."
The Qantas airline now wants to file a complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the passengers of the Airbus belonging to the Quantas company had been visibly more fortunate so far: In the course of its investigation, the Australian air safety authority found that the reactors of some A380 aircraft presented a serious safety problem, and warned against a possible lack of construction.
This potential failure could have serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the oil pipeline, it is indicated in a position statement published on Thursday by the ATSB administration.
It could have led to a "catastrophic reactor failure."
This applies to reactors manufactured Rolls-Royce and equipped with 20 A380 series aircraft.
The Quantas Airbus, which had to land urgently on 4 November in Singapore, is one of them.
The Australian airline has now instituted legal proceedings against the English reactor manufacturer.
She filed a legal complaint with an Australian federal court based in Sydney, which gives her the opportunity to take further legal action against the company.
Quantas' director, Alan Joyce, stated that his company would claim damages for the incident that occurred in early November.
Parts were detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the engine fire.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the ignition of oil that causes the damage.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators have announced that further safety tests will be conducted on superjumbos that are also equipped with the reactors in question.
The safety recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said ASTB spokesperson Martin Dolan.
The safety issue is considered to be sufficiently important to inform all parties concerned.
After the emergency landing of his aircraft, Quantas had stopped its entire A380 fleet on the ground for a week.
Singapore Airlines temporarily immobilized three of its eleven A380.
Lufthansa replaced the A380 reactor as a precautionary measure.
The double-deck aircraft is the largest airliner in the world.
Snowfall all over the country causes chaos in transport
Germany all covered in white: In one night, snow fell on almost the whole country.
Chaos reign on all roads, trains and planes are immobilized.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter makes Germany scream: By freezing temperatures, almost the entire republic is covered with snow on Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
To the north and east, snow cover reaches 15 centimetres in places.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and on many roads.
On the National A7 in Flensburg, the winter service staff worked permanently, but they were unable to overcome the snow that was constantly accumulating.
In addition, violent gusts swept the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Bureau of Maritime Navigation and Hydrography (DSH) expects tidal waves to occur on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels up to 1.2 m above normal.
Snow piles on highways and federal roads have caused serious problems in Saxony.
That's why the bad weather alert station Meteomedia has announced the purple alert level has been announced in Saxon Switzerland: in fact, it's the highest level.
In some places, 30 centimetres of fresh snow fell and the strong and cool winds dispersed.
Several trucks and cars were stuck there at night.
Even in Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities have announced serious disturbances on the roads.
On Highway A2, snow and wind caused traffic to stop and caused traffic plugs.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and A9 motorways.
According to Deutscher Bahn, serious disturbances in rail traffic occurred in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are: snow on railways, fallen trees on railways, catenary trees or destroyed needles.
In Saxony, the inter-regional transport Leipzig-Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Sallfeld, Thuringia, an ICE train to Munich had to interrupt its journey.
Fire brigades and paramedics had to supply the 165 passengers on the train with blankets, food and drinks.
Snow winds swept the roads.
The snowfall resulted in numerous flight cancellations at major airports in Germany.
According to a spokesman for the standard and flight information, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A spokesman for Fraport reports that 40 flights have already been cancelled in Frankfurt on the Main.
The winter service provides a permanent service.
It is true that there are no longer any more passengers trapped at the airport, despite the fact that only 400 beds are available at the airport.
Accidents occurred on Wednesday afternoon on many roads.
In the evening in Ostholstein, a truck driver lost his life during a collision with a train at a crossing.
The train driver was slightly injured.
Due to the snow layers on the roads, a similar accident occurred not far from Nuremberg: even here, a truck was caught at a crossing because the vehicle was immobilized there.
The driver lost his life.
Four passengers were injured on the train, which is why the road from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed until morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died when her car hit a slippery pavement in Aschaffenburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: The snow will always be soft and powdery, but it will swirl in case of slight gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea will be afflicted by strong and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, up to less than 15 degrees in places.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers.
The deutsche Bank seeks to separate itself from its emblem: According to news reports, this financial institution is looking for buyers for its two office buildings located at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
This building could cost up to 500 million Euro.
The Deutsche Bank has just improved the group's headquarters: The twin towers in the Business District have been modernised; in the meantime, the bankers have had to return to their former place of duty.
From now on, the financial group is clearly seeking to recover the costs of renovations and is looking for a buyer for its two buildings, as the newspaper "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesperson.
The spokesperson did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
He said "we check whether it is more interesting to occupy the buildings ourselves or to sell them, and to hire them again at a later date."
For example, Germany's largest financial institution has already given up its seat shortly thereafter.
It was only in mid-2007 that the bank acquired the twin towers for an amount of EUR 272 million from the equity holders and subsequently rehabilitated them.
Energy optimisation transformations have, according to some indications, engulfed around EUR 200 million.
A sale would obviously bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to information provided by the newspaper, experts in this sector estimate the value of the towers, which have since been renamed "Green Towers," at about 500 million Euros.
According to the spokesperson, it is not currently known whether the buildings will again be sold to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of people mourn the miners who died.
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people had a thought for buried miners who were declared dead as a result of several explosions in a mine.
It was not yet possible to trace the bodies because the security situation of the affected well continues to be precarious.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 minors between the ages of 17 and 62 had been buried underground.
A probe had been introduced into the affected well, but no evidence of survivors had been found.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and the subsequent explosions, no rescue team was able to descend to the mine for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration had considered that the minors had no chance of surviving.
Until now the bodies could not be traced.
Today, parents and friends organized a party in memory of the dead.
Thousands of people had gathered under a bright sun in Greymouth, south of New Zealand Island.
They observed two minutes of silence.
In memory of the 29 buried miners, 29 tables were installed on which the names, helmets and lamps could be seen.
Photos and personal effects, including clothing and surfboards, also had their place there.
The flags were mast in front of all public buildings in the country.
New Zealand's Prime Minister John Key told the commemorative celebration participants that New Zealand has nurtured the hope that the miners will rise to the surface.
"But they never came home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the graves, stated that he could not resign himself to accepting the death of his son until he saw his remains.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the commemorative celebration.
Minors of South African and British origin also buried during the first explosion on 19 November.
Relief workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
Police Prefect Gary Knowles told reporters that when the explosive gas masses are moved, the hot temperatures inside the mine begin to drop.
Go to hell, warrior!
Is the film Splatter an artificial film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the boundaries of the ancient genre with his film, "Walhalla Rising," epic of the fighter.
What audience did the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner; he frees himself from his executioner and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. This seems ideal for young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When he is in a bad mood, he rips the intestines of his enemies without waiting for them to be killed.
On the other hand, until the end of the film, the monk does not say any word about his real name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, at the detour of one or two sentences a few appalling cries of agony.
Otherwise, we say nothing and celebrate in the incredibly beautiful mountain landscape of Scotland, which is the setting of the Viking universe about a thousand years ago.
It would be ideal plus mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and excellent voyellings.
When a film targets more than one target group, it is a pity that they are mutually exclusive.
Since the publication of "Pusher," director Winding Refn has been regarded as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantino's trilogy of a fierce and stylistic drug dealer, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the dominant current or introduce a little less brutality to the art and essay cinema.
Most art cinema fans must experience horror at the brain that spreads all around and the intestines.
Movies of action die of boredom, when the monk embarks, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship destined for Jerusalem; they are drowned for an eternity by calm and haze before the crew arrives in America and continues to silence.
It is not surprising then that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributors in Germany and that they only exist in DVD format.
It is mainly because of the magnificent images of misery that have earned some attention, but also because the image of a thrilling film, from time to time, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance.
It is not about dialogues in this film, nor a coherent action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into a film.
The spectator can't escape.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly cuts his throat with icy images and a shiny soundtrack, but above all with an elusive hatred that springs from the hearts of the characters.
Only a young blond boy, who stands faithfully beside the blind, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger.
More than anything, the blind hero whose motives are never known, but who returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and temporarily allies by turning into a warrior, may be sent from the devil himself.
It represents rotting, but perhaps also, just for those who are, anyway, rotten.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that can be hated or admired, with the aim of annoyance, enthusiasm and astonishment.
A traumatic experience.
Mysterious earth works
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new indications of a nuclear programme developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take a position on this subject, let alone to submit itself to the Agency's controls.
On the night of 5-6 September 2007, around midnight, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic-shaped building on Syrian territory.
It is located on the bank of the Euphrates; the largest town nearby is 30 kilometres away: it is Dair as-Sur.
Its name appears in the IAEA documents, because there is talk of the reactor Syria has built with the help of North Korea in stone parallelepiped, hidden in a valley marked by the absence of electric power.
According to a briefing by the United States intelligence services, the CIA, dated late April 2008, said that the current reactor, known as the neighbouring locality, el-Kibar, was well suited to producing plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
On the other hand, this technique has been valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video with blurred satellite images.
Through computer-assisted animation, it indicated the likely location of each reactor component prior to the destruction of the plant, which represents a miniature copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
In addition, she presented the photos showing the nearby building, or even the interior of it.
It appears that the reactor was about to be commissioned, but it was not yet equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the Israeli bombardment, little more information is available than at the time, and even, over time, the mystery is getting thicker and thicker.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to this attack, the CIA was certain that Syria had built a reactor at el-Kibar, but had no clues that Syria was developing "an active nuclear weapons program."
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be more cautious about this and speak only of a "presumed reactor," even if they consider the presentation of the CIA to be "plausible."
They lack tangible evidence, as well as at the IAEA.
When asked about how he made sure he was dealing with a nuclear reactor, a senior United Nations diplomat gave only a laconic answer in the summer saying that the IAEA had "sufficient documents to ask questions."
The Syrian people certainly precipitated the removal of the rubble from the "unused military building" and proceeded to a methodical flattening of the land.
However, in June 2008, a team of IAEA experts led by former Chief Inspector Oli Heinonen, discovered at el-Kibar traces of uranium produced by men.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images from commercial providers through one Member State showing the moment that followed the attack. It appears that the latter are more eloquent than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because the anonymous sponsor, perhaps Israel, acquired them exclusively.
It is therefore impossible for the IAEA to establish their authenticity objectively.
Syria has always assured us that it has never carried out a secret atomic program and that it has not built a reactor.
Damascus claims that the uranium found on the site comes from the weapons used by Israel.
However, the IAEA rejected this argument after the analysis of the particles and described it as implausible.
Since then, damas has refused any discussion about this, as well as about satellite images.
Moreover, Syria does not allow controllers to carry out a second inspection on the site of el-Kibar and refuses access to the rubble of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps a stubborn silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Prime Minister in office at the time of the attack, recently said: "We will never comment on this."
For example, the investigation into this case has been stalled since June 2008 without a result and "is increasingly becoming a serious problem of credibility for the Agency," as acknowledged by a senior Western diplomat serving at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna, which is ultimately a serious violation of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty.
The IAEA considers that progress requires clarification of the existence of the other three facilities that must be "functionally related" to the alleged reactor.
So far, inspectors have not indicated which facilities they are dealing with here, or what their function is or what they are suspected of containing.
According to information published by the newspaper "Süddeutsche Zeitung," they are known within the IAEA respectively as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah also by the names of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington, D.C., has identified these localities and discovered on satellite images a complex near Masyaf that would most likely be one of the suspect objects.
It is possible that it is located in or directly adjacent to a military base, which is exactly why Syria refuses access to IAEA inspectors from all three sites.
In Vienna, it is claimed that the Syrians fear that the inspection group would in fact be spies sent on behalf of the United States by the IAEA to spy on military installations.
In fact, it is intelligence provided by US secret agents that attracts the attention of nuclear inspectors.
The IAEA has information, including satellite photos, indicating that vehicles have made shuttles between the three sites and the stone parallelepiped in order to transport substances.
A high-ranking Western diplomat said in Vienna that at least one of the facilities could "be used for fuel production."
It would have "no indication of sensitive activities," such as uranium enrichment and reprocessing; processes that are indispensable for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor certainly works with unenriched uranium.
Nevertheless, there are plausible hypotheses to the rigour concerning the following fundamental questions: where should uranium have come from and where would the plutonium needed to make the bomb have been separated later?
It is not known whether the rubble, which could hide valuable traces, has been stored at all three sites.
Once the hundreds of trucks loaded with dirt have disappeared, no one will have information about where the rubble will be stored.
For the IAEA, it is unlikely that Syria had the salt mine at al-Tibni, located only a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, examined in 1998 to see if it could be suitable for the storage of radioactive waste.
In recent analysis of satellite photographs taken for the famous Jane's Intelligence Review magazine, former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley established a link between these and the reactor in question.
Satellite photographs, however, show that Syria has begun earthworks at the three suspect sites and moved huge containers when IAEA began to demand access to those sites.
It may be a coincidence, but it has not helped to rule out suspicions.
He said in the diplomatic community that the IAEA had spent several months drawing up a plan for the inspections to be carried out there, which was intended to enable Syria to preserve possible military secrets; only the time invested showed how much interest the inspectors had in the matter.
Meanwhile, Damascus has also ignored this proposal.
A year ago, if Western diplomats in Vienna had not reported the destruction of the reactor, the urgency would not be reported for this case, says, for example, Glyn Davies, the US ambassador who has been talking for a few months about what is known as special inspections, one of the most powerful means at the disposal of the Atomic Agency to implement its controls.
The IAEA Director, Mr. Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option to which I am open in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a huge risk that this will happen: on the one hand, it will require a majority in the IAEA Board of Governors, and many of the 35 countries represented in it have no desire to see the situation escalate.
on the other hand, like this diplomat who gives to think: "Would it serve, if in the end they find nothing"
Love in times of war
It's been going bad since Angelina Jolie made her summer debut as a director.
She wrote the script herself: it's a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin.
Nothing more is known about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort.
A persistent rumor indicates that the Muslim woman fell in love with her Serbian executioner during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosniak women's federations immediately protested, and in response, some shooting sequences planned for Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at the last minute.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue in Bosnia.
According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war sent correspondence to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and she demanded to meet the actress. Jolie herself is a goodwill ambassador of UNHCR.
She is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered these women to meet them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," says Hasecic.
There have been no love stories in concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says quite a lot about her attitude towards the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic's organization subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the status of Goodwill Ambassador to Angelina Jolie.
But, by the way, what kind of scenario did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had received copies of its script, had granted permission to shoot in Sarajevo after a few hesitations, but it was unclear why it had not subsequently come despite that permission.
The young author herself assures that she does not pursue political objectives with her film, that by making a lot of effort she has become aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of the war and give all the parties involved the opportunity to express themselves.
However, it remains vague about the content.
Thus a second synopsis of the film circulates on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meets again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to the Serbian concentration camp where the man works as a guard.
Still, this is a big difference with the version "a rape victim falls in love with her executioner."
That Jolie's movie started long before the war, of course.
The pressure on her, thus expressed Jolie, is "unjust and based on misinformation."
From now on, only Hollywood fanatics can give him peace: By illegally putting this scenario on the Net, like many others before.
Let's get out of here!
Tonight, everything's fine with the Irish again.
No sign of dismay.
This is why the local team overdominates visitors from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans scream with joy in the background of loud music, they stumble with their feet.
Cork's Baileyu-Pub in southern Ireland vibrates because players throw and manage to drop table tennis balls at a distance of three meters in beer cups of the opposing team.
This bizarre show is called "beer-pong." The winner takes 500 Euros plus a plane ticket to attend in January in Las Vegas at the world beer-pong championship.
Cian Tanner is a quiet individual; this subtle drinking game and the computer specialist reserved, these two behaviours really don't go well together.
Yet, despite this, the 26-year-old seeks to have fun, to turn away from the fierce question, which will lead to the future.
The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not included in his plans. In January, he will lead job interviews in New Zealand.
"I feel a strange feeling, however," he says.
"The home country is so far away and I don't have a job."
Finally: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland, "in less than two, she got her desired job as an event project manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man smiling.
Because of the bleak prospects in the country, two of Tanner's three sisters have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, and his brother Colin is now a computer consultant in London.
Young people leave: The situation of most families living on the island is similar to that of tanners.
Experts from the Institute for Economic and Social Research indicate that 100,000 Irish will soon leave their country.
They even foresee 200,000 emigrants by 2015.
This is a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million people.
If these forecasts are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish enjoyed a great deal of comfort, grief has now taken its place.
However, the economic crisis is particularly affecting well-trained young Irish people, who have so far had only moments of happiness.
Job loss and social deprivation seemed absurd in the years of economic boom.
Everyone had a job, there's excess money.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten people under the age of 30 are unemployed.
The Irish Times published extensively the letters of readers written by young emigrants, who complained: "In Ireland, everything is drifting away."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but whoever has the possibilities, goes away and our country thus a whole generation."
"The last one to leave turns off the light."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a darker future because the government is just throwing powder in the eye and offering young people no prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old student.
She sees how her comrades cling from one practicum to another without pay.
She says that her biggest concern is to emigrate herself in four years.
"It's a sad and depressing thought."
However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo" fair, which offers full support on the theme "working abroad."
"But working abroad is an extraordinary opportunity for new people in the profession to take the first steps in the professional hierarchy," says the manager.
Its website shows photos of surfers in Australia and snowsurfers in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not a struggle, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure.
For the past six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it means to be based elsewhere.
As there was nothing left to do in Ireland for this 29-year-old engineer, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction sector and Germany.
A fashion house just came out of the ground in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to work on other Hanover or Berlin projects.
In the meantime, O'Donovan rarely visits his home country, as he participates in an additional workstation, so that he can complete the repayment of the credit he has contracted to build his home in the home country.
"The situation is already a little crazy," he says, crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I'm making money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I hardly live anymore."
He bursts out of an embarrassed laughter when crossing the cold rooms.
The small house is located in a residential area with well-groomed front gardens, expensive cars of major brands are parked on the access roads.
Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister for 380,000 Euros, 100 percent of which was financed by the credit.
"These were moments of madness, without a doubt, the money was easy," he says.
Is he afraid to see everything fall apart because of the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, restores hot tea and says: "I have no children to care for and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The building engineer doesn't like the lamentations he's often heard lately.
"No one should suffer from hunger, our situation is still not as dramatic as what we once experienced here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while isn't the worst thing to do, maybe that's what made us feel Irish first.
He then laughs and talks about his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis.
"He was back after spending seven years there and in Ireland life simply continued."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Leave the future and find out how life goes elsewhere.
In his list, he already has a few years of work in London. That's why life must not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend.
But there is still one thing that worries him in the last few days: the celebration to be held on the occasion of his 27th anniversary in Dublin.
He's afraid she can turn into a farewell party.
"Only, not a lot of emotions," he said, drinking a long sip of beer.
"A good-bye, it still seems worrying."
"Let's call it a good-bye night, all relaxed, bringing together some friends, with some drinks and some games."
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as does support for private enterprise.
Crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarómetro survey in 18 countries published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it follows the changes in attitude in the region.
Two interrelated elements emerge from this year's survey, conducted in September and early October.
The first is the rather sunny mood of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries around the Pacific of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6 per cent per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also increased in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a sharp fall in output last year.
But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Table 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way their country's democracy worked in practice; this is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase of 25% in 2001 (Figure 3).
Some 34 per cent said they had confidence in their country's parliament and 45 per cent in their government, the same as last year in both cases; but up sharply from 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent respectively).
Ten years ago, economic problems in Latin America undermined support for democracy.
While this held well during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries in America have suffered only a short recession and benefited from a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and decreased again this year to 32 per cent.)
But the mood varies considerably from country to country (see Chart 4).
Brazil's good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, translate into a widely shared sense of progress
This is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession has been more severe and violent crimes have worsened.
It was only for the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole cited crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their country (see Table 5).
About 31% say they or one of their loved ones have been the victims of a crime in the past year; however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: about 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, compared with 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
Some 58 per cent believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, compared to 47 per cent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela agree (and 80% support the private company); although their left-wing president, Hugo Chavez, executes many private companies.
Brazil is the largest leader in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down 11% since last year)
But the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and most of Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A dirty vote
No one expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was much worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the affected country and plunged into fear.
Polling boxes and a new ballot were presented, ballot papers were scattered in the gutters, polling stations were ransacked and intimidation was carried out.
The polling stations opened late in the evening.
Many Hatians, including many who were displaced as a result of the January earthquake, were wandering around to find where to vote.
Some of them ended up giving up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several alleged favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded throughout the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the senior official in Haiti of the United Nations, regards the event as "a fairly good election in many respects."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that they "did not believe that these irregularities, however serious they may be, necessarily invalidated the process."
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second round is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
But there may be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or no visible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second turn.
With a raging cholera epidemic, and more than 1 million earthquake survivors still living in tents, there was concern that participation would be.
In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from voting because of the disorganization.
Nearly 250,000 identity cards, needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election.
The issue is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in Haiti's reconstruction.
And so, clearly, Haitians do it themselves.
The tip of the feet towards the centre
The weeks after suddenly becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, President of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved her approval rate by 20 points to over 50%; this is her highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Mrs Fernández, who is obviously in mourning, whether or not she would abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain confused.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, was used to developing budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend the extra income at will.
Mrs Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (where a parliamentarian struck one of his peers in the face and others accused the government of corruption), Congress does not have to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
At present, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the President with more flexibility to spend at will.
The economy is overheating widely: it is likely to grow by almost 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1%, but many private estimates and union wage claims see this figure close to 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction a priority, rather than inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, harassed the private sector and purged INDEC, the statistical office, which falsified official inflation statistics.
Can Mrs Fernández now moderate these policies?
It called for talks between private companies and trade union leaders.
And his officials say they want to limit next year's salary increases to 18%.
The economy has been stimulated by high world prices of Argentina's agricultural exports.
But inflation has eroded the boost to growth following a sharp devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs Fernández is showing signs of wanting to re-establish Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the debtors who had refused a forced prior debt restructuring for which Argentina had not settled its maturities in 2001.
Now Ms Fernández seems to be eating towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners have always insisted that this would not involve IMF surveillance, as is customary.
But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of the Economy, announced that the Fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer price index, which looks like a prelude to the consolidation of INDEC.
It is not clear whether Mrs Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term of office, now that her husband is no longer with her.
If she does, she needs to win middle-class support, among which kirchnerism is very much advocated.
When the Argentinians returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her turned back.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether to repudiate, without any noise, many of her husband's policies.
A half-hooray for China
Taiwanese voters are moving towards a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
On November 27, more than 7.5 million electors, or 70% of eligible voters, elected mayors and municipal councillors in five urban districts, as part of what is considered a general assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a substitute for feelings in relation to the continent, having forged innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, in the biggest reorganization of relations with China itself since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but just right.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) won three of the five mayors, he failed to win the majority of votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has moved towards full independence in Taiwan, has won nearly 50% of all votes for the 45% KMT.
If it had been a presidential election, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's voting share has dropped by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP attracted voters, even with the KMT, to municipal councils.
The event revealed most of the main topics of the Taiwanese elections, including taped country trucks and mass rally flags with girls dancing in minimal dress.
A mandatory mysterious assassination attempt was also carried out.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, conducted an election tour for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
A man from the crowd shot the young M. Lien, purely through his face, injuring him and killing a passer-by.
Oddly enough, it was not determined whether the shooter wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or resolve a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the PDP leader, the murder had an impact on the election by directing suspicion to the DPP and turning voters to the KMT.
Maybe the biggest winner of the election was China.
It was striking how absent the question of the mainland itself was.
Instead, the candidates played with the plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
Thus, the KMT tends to avoid parading its ties with the Beijing government.
But this time, the DPP also refrained from stirring up anti-Chinese sentiment.
This is a response to a new awareness that Chinese companies are essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, demanded confirmation as to whether his policy on China was acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
It can be expected that the Beijing government will continue to provide trade facilities, in line with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China has not wasted time sending a negotiator to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would also like to see political integration; but let us begin with the beginning.
It is better to wait for this after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself anyway.
Two years ago, he was in trouble: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, had been sent to prison on charges of corruption.
President from 2000 to 2008, he was a provocator for explicit independence.
But a new generation of moderates has emerged under Tsai's leadership and the PDP is doing everything possible to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai was greeted as a DPP presidential candidate, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr. Chen.
Their party is doing its best to show that he too can engage with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a panel of experts to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided that their discussions could take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party presented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be exasperated by this change.
In a statement published from his cell, he stated that the PDP candidates would have achieved better results if they had insisted that Taiwan was a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, it will be difficult for the DPP to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT has to do a self-introspection.
Mr. Ma's assessments were weak; despite staggering economic growth, KMT candidates did not want to campaign with him.
Its unpopularity appears to be largely due to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman said that his cabinet and local branches would be redesigned.
The good results of the PDP suggest that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent editorialist, "the point of no return has already passed."
Grammy Awards Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "Best New Artist"
Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read it.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bass player and singer hand-picked by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, scored one of the Grammy Awards surprises this year with a large-scale nomination in the "Best New Artist" category.
Considering that Spalding has been a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the nomination remains somewhat mysterious, but it is consistent with the Grammy Awards rules that an artist must not release more than three albums before recording; this "establishes the public identity of this artist."
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward and, given his slightly engaging vocal style, his skilful hand of pop and funk and his Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least one dotted line in Spalding compared to Norah Jones' amazing success in 2003, the closest equivalent for the Grammy Awards voters taking into account jazz productions in this category in recent years.
Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honoured Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, a ride on a thrill invigorating recording that was one of the primordial favorites last year.
Among these Iyer, "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboarder John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favourite and frequent guest at HBO's "Treme," was honoured in the contemporary jazz category, which is also strongly inclined towards a certain fusion with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
Secret Society of the savage Darcy James Argue, familiar with steampunk, won some well-deserved recognition in the big ensemble category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz Billy Childs Ensemble and the eternal adventurer Dave Holland whose October's live album "Pathways" was a fine example of this bass player's democratic hand as a group leader.
Grammy Awards Nominated: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey lead in Classical Categories
The classic nominations for the annual 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of landscapes of musicians and composers from around the world.
At the top of the nominations are Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five "yes"; and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an electric orchestral work, with three "yes."
Among the nominees with links to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles," a work commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra that opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Los Angeles-based composer's Madolin Concerto, Avner Dorman, is also competing for an award.
Classical appointments are divided into 13 categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo recordings.
A category for the classic producer of the year features five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are the Bruckner Symphonies No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the art of the Castrati" featuring various artists; and the "Requiem" of Verdi of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are "Lulu" by Berg of the Royal Opera House Orchestra, "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Adolf Hasse of Ars Lyrica Houston; "L'Amour de Loin" by Kaija Saariaho of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Rodion Shchedrin of the Orchestra and the Choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and "Ivanhoé" by Arthur Sullivan of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Composers who are in place for the Grammy Awards for contemporary composition include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wanderer Enchanted."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had its premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, directed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The work of about 30 minutes is nicknamed "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovski, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for his instrumental solo performance with an orchestra.
The Los Angeles composer said that he wrote the 15-minute work especially for the performer at the mandolin Avi Avital, who played the concerto with the Metropolis Ensemble, sitting in New York.
"I wrote it using sounds from the Middle East and a large number of North African ranges and rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
85-year-old conductor Pierre Boulez received an appointment in the orchestra performance category for directing the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Among the instrumental soloists who received an appointment were pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs, violinist Julia Fischer and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year, there are only vocalist-soloist nominees: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonová, Vicica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic blends, the soprano Jessye Norman received an appointment for her recording "Racines: ma vie, ma chanson"
The Temecula Mosque project won the approval of the Planning Commission.
A mosque project in Temecula received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often passionate.
Critics attacked the project by claiming that it promoted both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But the commissioners ruled on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local laws and that it would be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support him: Christians, Jews, Baha'is, you mention it," said Hadi Nael, President of the Temecula Valley Islamic Centre, speaking Thursday morning.
"I am proud of it, as an American citizen."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he added.
"They just have very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The session began at 6 p.m. and lasted until almost midnight with, most of the time, people speaking in favour of or against the centre, at approximately evenly distributed speaking time, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one speaker wrote.
"This is another planet of monkeys with Miss Liberty dead in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic centres have also provoked protests in other parts of the country, including Ground Zero, the site of the attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush denounced violence in the Temecula Valley.
Her congregation of 135 families co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse she rented on a property shared with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24.943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture would consist of two minarets and would rise to 43 feet high.
It would occupy a site of 4.32 hectares on the Nicolas road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still appeal against this project to the municipal council.
An arsenic-tolerant microbe raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the field to find new life forms on Earth and perhaps beyond.
Although researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
"This organization has a dual capacity."
"It can be developed either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"This is why it is very special, even though it is far from being a truly" foreign "form of life," commented Paul Davies C. W. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report in the Thursday's online edition of Science.
Six major elements have long been considered essential to life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But researchers have discovered that the bacterium, discovered in Mono Lake, California, is able to continue to develop after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
"One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar D. of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
Discovery is important in the search for life beyond the Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what life looks like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the finding, generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could disclose the discovery of an alien life.
That was not the case.
The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to operate biochemistry and that the" standard "set of elements, which we consider absolutely necessary for life, might not be fixed," commented Charles Cockell, professor at the Institute of Planetary and Spacious Scientific Research, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a fortuitous discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Institute of Astrology, who led the study, chose Lake Mono because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to substitute for one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behaviour is really similar to that of phosphorus."
"As a result, it is difficult for organizations to distinguish these elements separately."
"But arsenic is different enough that it doesn't work exactly like phosphorus; it enters inside and, in a way, gums the work of our biochemical machine," Anbar explained.
Researchers collected the bacterium known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing levels of arsenic to which it was able to adapt and grow.
The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or on the moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, Assistant Professor of Microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus was not new; but nothing has ever shown that it could work.
Arsenic was more common at the beginning of the Earth's existence, she says; for example, researchers hypothesized that early life forms could have used it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not just the way life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health.
The last two stolen exhibition dogs were found in Compton.
The other two exhibition dogs out of four stolen from outside a motel in Bellflower were found, and the sheriffs of Los Angeles County anonced it on Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two akitas and two Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the Chevrolet Express van in which they had spent the night outside a Bellflower motel 6, announced the authorities.
Two of the dogs were picked up on Wednesday afternoon and the other two were found at the end of the evening on Wednesday, said Steve Whitmore, spokesperson for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that dogs are fine," says Whitmore.
"They're in good shape."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, in which area and under what circumstances they were discovered.
"An investigation is under way."
"We don't want to say it," Whitmore said.
"We follow orders."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be reached to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were reunited Wednesday afternoon with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey.
Sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were safe and sound, the authorities announced.
But Bunny and Peter, the corgis that Rickard and Peek had planned to show at regional competitions this week, on behalf of the owners of the Japanese dogs, were reported missing until their discovery on Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend as part of the national champion "AKC / Eukanuba" of Long Beach, where they planned to present Trace.
The other dogs were expected to compete in other events scheduled in the days leading up to the exhibition "AKC / Eukanuba," Peek told the Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops of the canine exhibition tour of almost a month of the couple.
Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked the motel.
They often stay in the motels and park their van outside, right next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell burrow and a Breton epagneul - who stayed with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgis, with thicker fur, in the van where it would be cooler.
They opened the windows a little, so the dogs could have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van stolen at 6: 00 on Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, equipped with an implanted microchip to identify them.
It is not clear whether a reward was awarded on Thursday.
The lion is ready to blush again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting only for the final green light of the court
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal bankruptcy judge in New York officially praised Thursday the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors according to which about $5 billion of debt would be cleared; paving the way for the entertainment enterprise, having 86 years of existence, to focus its efforts on the production and distribution of films and television programs.
With Thursday's decision that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no legal obstacles remain before MGM to recover under the supervision of the founders of Entertainment Spyglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the general directors of what will be a lightened studio.
Staff will be reduced to about 320 out of 400 at the start.
MGM will not really emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase concludes a $500 million credit facility to fund new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently being distributed under licence by the investment bank, which itself faces $75 million, and is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The process of restructuring the studio began in May 2009 when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was engaged to advise management on how to place its finances as it could not afford to pay interest of $300 million per year.
In August, Executive Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and an expert in recovery known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to resolve MGM's financial difficulties and satisfy the more than 140 creditors in the studio took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed, at the end of 2009, to put the company on sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders, none of whom were willing to pay the $2 billion more that the creditors were looking for.
In the spring of this year, everything had to be done again when the MGM team had started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal disagreement and debate, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially emerged from bankruptcy in the following weeks, the Moelis and Cooper companies received several million-dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper's businesses, which have raised $375,000 per month for their corporate management services, will receive a $4 million "success bonus."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to restart the production of MGM, which released only one film this year, and set up an annual list of seven or eight films that would be released starting in 2012.
They also intend to co-fund two films based on the "Hobbit," with Warner Bros
The studio must enter into a separate loan between $265,000,000 and $275 million to finance its share in these two films, which are to be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who holds about 18% of MGM's debt, attempted to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the main shareholder.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Tech Toys to keep your gift budget in balance
Although the main candidate for this year's most wonderful toy is the IPAD, followed, perhaps, by Microsoft's video game system, Kinect, both can make a major breach in your gift budget.
Consider that, for the price of an iPad, you can buy five BMX bikes at $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 classic bead jump strings, or about 48 Play-Doh boxes.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
Recently, I visited three national toy vendors - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It is clear that Moore's Law has evolved, this year's technological toy is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price if not a little less, compared to last year.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys associated with websites, two of the best known of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery toys are on the rise, as are rechargeable battery toys.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise specified.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13 for 3 years and more) are stuffed toys the size of an Indian pig that sing a note when you squeeze them on their belly.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second one allows you to compose a song.
If you buy several, they'll sing in harmony.
Attention: once you start pressing, you can't stop.
To combine singing with dancing, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
Drawing on last year's Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays games in turn like Simon Says and can do lunar dance thanks to its innovative articulated feet with wheel lock.
The children who tried the toy use Mickey as a dance instructor while their parents complain about a lack of volume control.
If you're a kid from the '80s, you'll remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
It is back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and over), with a backpack filled with questionnaire game cards designed to turn a ride into a car session with a self-correction and valve cabinet.
If you are suspicious when your child is holding your smartphone, here are three autonomous alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo ($60 for 3 to 8 year olds) is the cheapest and easiest to use, with a qwerty keyboard, although the games do not educate as effectively as the Explorer Leapster ($70 for 3 to 12 year olds), it is the first major revision of the Leapster range, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for 3 to 7 year olds) uses an iTunes-like system to offer games and e-books and has an SD card entry to display family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and older) is a set of five blocks barely larger than a match box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by placing blocks online before time runs out, it's ideal for an impromptu spelling contest.
Increasingly, toys have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toy stores, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online Penguin Club pet, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2 "Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6 to 12) which includes a piece marked with a hidden code.
When you buy the code online, your child receives enough credit from Club Penguin for two items of choice.
These can be roller skates or Puffle toy pets.
Slightly bigger than the hair at the end of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest button cell microrobots.
The false beast moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone pastes in random directions.
It's fun to do a maze of blocks to see if she can find her way through.
It is also strong.
Ours resisted a fall from the kitchen table and even a momentary passage through our dog's mouth.
Bringing a milder side to the maintenance of law and order in China
Tang Shenbin was surveying a place in the city as an urban sergeant in training by severely inspecting his nerve charges, issuing low-voice orders with a military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan - prominent law and order officials in China, afraid and despised for their arbitrary repression and their inclination to violence - to convey a certain impression to a group of spectators.
"Stand straight!"
"Be piercing!"
Show them, he said, "What do pretty girls look like?"
Four girls who had barely spent adolescence in white gloves, dressed in identical olive jackets and trousers, were stuck in your guard.
Four pairs of black heel shoes, aligned to the rule.
Four neat hats perfectly perched at the top of hair tied by a striped knot in blue and white.
"Personally, I think they look medium," said Mr. Tang, with disdain.
"The models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city demanded that all new recruits have a graduate degree.
Guangdong province traded the grey-green uniforms for a so-called more engaging blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced them with the strong way:: in 2009, a report reported that 50 officers had surrounded an uncontrollable snack cart by throwing black eyes, firmly for half an hour, until the colporter packed his belongings and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen to carry out a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district has completed its urban street police with 13 women, specially chosen for their appearance, galbo and young age.
The idea is to give the degrossed police a softer, more feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson may have trouble getting a look at this underground urban brigade of China
And because of that, the critics will say.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce municipal orders by imposing fines or other administrative sanctions.
But the Chinese media depict news from a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei province beat to death an observer after he used his mobile phone to film them dispersing a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors, stolen and posted, describes how to effectively defeat offenders without bloodshed.
This year in Shanghai, a watermelon peddler was abandoned with a brain injury after a fight with five officers.
A violent video game, available by online download, shows Chinese inspectors trained to assault street vendors.
"Chengguan scored the government," lamented last year China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth controversy about tactics.
The newspaper called for a "real complete clean-up."
Skeptics say the approach is far from complete.
After the district made an announcement in October to find eight new female recruits, an editorial, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether women had real jobs or were just a tourist entertainment.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district announcement required women candidates between the ages of 18 and 22 to have a beautiful figure and "the five facial traits in the right order."
They must be larger than the average size of 1.6 metres or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches.
Retirement at age 26 is compulsory.
The officers stated that the work was physically too painful for women over 25 years of age.
"It's their image that's important," said a district officer at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they are appropriate; they are size, weight, facial traits, etc."
Then comes temperament and "inner qualities."
The Chengguan women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "In addition to being vases, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district management office of the city, does not agree with this description.
But he noted that height requirements were the standard in many Chinese job offers for both sexes.
This is the case with the demand for the order of the facial traits.
That it means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese.
It is true that disabled or disfigured persons must not apply.
"We can't let a person who can do business or a hunchback come and serve here," says Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good picture."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old and has cheeks pommelated with a finely curved mouth.
She does not consider the development of her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a disillusioned look.
Xu Yang, his 21-year-old dimple colleague, says, "Our job is to present the image of the city."
They did not object to their mandate being limited, they said, because they had greater career ambitions than simply chasing vendors into the alleyways where they were supposed to limit their activities.
Every morning, the team faces a dozen street vendors who move quickly on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many tofu breads or bowls as possible before fleeing.
"Master Wang, you must leave."
"We've already told you several times!," Xu said as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning her noodle bike-cart.
Officers describe their duties as monotonous rather than arduous.
"It's about the same thing every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing after work.
"Great routine."
One reason is that female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the seller's property.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male superiors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public displays of animosity against bureaucracy that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rebelled after the spread of false rumours that Chengguan agents had killed a salesman.
In one night, more than a dozen Chengguan police and agents were injured, 14 government vehicles were overthrown or set on fire.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the placid Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The agents confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike was shouting scandal.
A 15-minute arm of iron followed before the sinister face of the police raided their way with elbows towards their vehicle and left at full speed with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator attached to the men's team, stayed behind, his white badge turned over to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators - men aged 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not trained to maintain a waxed image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Li said in a neutral tone.
"Most of the time, the audience starts."
Prosecutors will not charge Senator Ensign
Department of Justice prosecutors dropped criminal charges against Senator John Ensign, arising from a case related to an assistant in an old campaign and his efforts to get lobbying work for the wife's husband, announced on Wednesday the Senator's lawyers.
The decision puts an end to the most serious legal threat faced by Mr. Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered a possible Republican candidate for the 2012 presidential election until the scandal surrounding his case made the national headlines last year and undermined his career.
Mr. Ensign's office stated that he was "very happy" with the decision, the result of a one-year investigation.
The Senator could still be subject to disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers stated that the Department of Justice had "informed that Senator Ensign was no longer under investigation and that he did not intend to maintain any charges against him in this case."
The Department of Justice has refrained from commenting on this matter.
The announcement came as a kind of surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice that there was significant evidence that Mr. Ensign had conspired to violate a federal criminal prohibition on lobbying.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first released in the New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to obtain lucrative lobbying work to gain the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the Senator's case with her.
Ms. Hampton once served as a treasurer in an Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign contacted a number of political funders to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton had recently been a collaborator of Mr. Ensign, he was barred for one year by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole.
The ethics experts argued that the unusual agreement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends prior to the case, appears to be in contradiction with the so-called lobby door ban.
According to the evidence that was made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate and a substantial violation of the law of the revolving door," said Stanley Brand, a Washington-based lawyer who specializes in defending clients of a government investigation.
Although the department's judge refused to explain the reasoning that led to the decision in Ensign, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed to be wary of political prosecutions after a number of high-level setbacks in its Public Integrity Section, including the decisions taken last year to drop the prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens accused of failing to prosecute.
Federal prosecutors are clearly afraid to take up arms, said Melanie Sloan, the Director General for Citizens' Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defence group that received several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
"This basically says high-ranking government officials can now assume the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr. Ensign's senior counsel, stated in an interview that he had received a telephone call on Monday from a Department of Justice prosecutor and a follow-up the following day, telling him that the Department was not looking for charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's team of lawyers had cooperated with the prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated on Wednesday in a statement, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made to the prosecution.
"I'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice, except to say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to drop an investigation following an independent complaint by the ethics group, arguing that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Ensign's parents in Hampton violated federal election law.
The Election Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was anything but a gift.
NV Energy, a prominent Nevada company that has long supported the Senator, is a company for which Mr. Ensign helped Hampton find lobbying work.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that, after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, contacted Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "hammering" the Ministry of the Interior on a matter in dispute.
Mr. Ensign also attended a lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and asked the Transportation Secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby.
When news of the case surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned from his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for several months, Mr. Ensign stated two weeks ago that he intended to run for a third term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokesperson, Jennifer Cooper, stated that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and terminate its investigation.
Senator Ensign looks forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada, she says.
Cheshire's call to Twitter
Half a dozen of them were tapping away in the rows of the courtroom.
They sent horrifying testimonials every minute via Twitter.
In the end, the defense said that there were over 140,000 messages about the rape trial and the children attached to their bed in a house that was set on fire.
Thursday, the largely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was found guilty of the murder of three members of the Cheshire family in Connecticut, is expected to culminate in an official end to the death penalty imposed by the judge, which was passed by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already filed evidence in court that sketches appeal arguments that could occupy the courts for years.
What is provocative is that the intense reports on the trial - as well as the widespread and widespread use by Twitter journalists - created a "circus atmosphere," a saturation so widespread and instantaneous with inflammatory details that the jury was badly influenced by public passions.
The request could lead the appellate judges to debate whether new technologies require new rules in courtrooms.
"I have experienced this during this trial; I think there is a real danger that the introduction of new technologies into courtrooms is undermining human rights to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer.
The trial judge, Jon C. Bleue of the Superior Court of State, laconically rejected the claims in last week's judgement, claiming that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury was motivated by passion.
But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue.
Appeal courts have recognized for decades that media coverage of well-known cases can raise questions about the fairness of a trial.
In a landmark judgment of 1966, the United States Supreme Court quashed the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in his decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at trial" because of the media.
The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and the film "The fugitive."
Some lawyers have stated that the appellate courts seized to review Mr. Hayes's conviction half a century later may be curious given the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage courtroom communications, unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in large trials, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that it was arbitrarily applied.
Professor Donohue stated that some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms could allow for fairer trials.
The case of Twitter is only one of many described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, which can be discussed for years; this delays execution.
Defence counsel also allege, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered harm when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them macabre photos of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers argue that they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge unfairly expelled one of the juror, who had been criticized before the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure on a verdict by making the unusual decision to have the jury deliberate in a weekend.
The jurors were not sequestered.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that it was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for the office of governor and the Senate of the United States.
They maintained that the computer media were constantly stirring the flames of the emotion of the case.
"The daily hustle of media tweets, cameras and journalists outside the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "looked nothing like what had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even on a national scale."
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the assertion that snapshots were more inflammatory than press releases delivered more slowly was a Luddist view that would impoverish the Court's policy of media coverage of future trials.
However, some lawyers stated that courts of appeal were often drawn to arguments that social and technological changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this claim.
In their case, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision that reversed Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the media coverage of the trial and stated that they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media.
"This case," they wrote, "represents that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can civility bring the cleavages closer together?
After a campaign marked by invective and negativity, a minimum of civility broke out in Washington this week.
Is this a forerunner sign of genuine forward bipartite cooperation or an illusory moment before the rapid return to partisan struggle in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and Congress leaders did not produce any breakthrough on the major issues that need to be addressed during the "lame duck" session.
But obviously, there was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two sides as well as the recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than another episode where each side wanted to score points.
The public meeting on Wednesday of the president's deficit committee was just as civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created mutual respect that transcends the ideological divide, but still divides the membership.
It is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
The two parties are now in a period of trial and trial with a view to obtaining signs of cooperation and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed partisan war.
That is why Tuesday's meeting and subsequent comments from participants revealed a minimum of requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too profound to suggest a rapid change in the climate that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxation, expenditure, health care or rights, both sides remain miles away.
Yet the November election had moderated Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official, now alongside the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections arouse partisan passions and then they fade away.
That's good. "
On certain issues, notably those on the agenda of the "lame duck" session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush's tax cuts will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of that.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of them permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, a compromise could be reached on the extension of unemployment benefits, if only because the Republicans could not afford to give the impression that they were in favour of tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment benefits to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is more optimism about a possible agreement on the issues raised during the session on "lame duck," with the ratification of the New START Pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on the most pressing issues of the "blade duck" session will not necessarily lead to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress meets in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is likely, if not inevitable.
"Once the things that have to be done will be done, psychology in the short term will return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed his widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to genuine cooperation.
"I consider most of what happens between today and 2012 as a pre-show or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this are closely related to the composition of the new Republican majority in the House and to the voters present at the tea that contributed to its creation.
However, Republican leaders are aware of the dangers if they go too far, they know that they must try to live up to their promises to reduce public spending and repeal the new health care law.
These partisan positions are already clear in the initial reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing expenditure.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their view, have imposed the deficit issue on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to issue their plan as an official recommendation, and they have had difficulty reaching that number.
The greatest resistance remains among the elected members of the group, suggesting that there is little reason or willingness to compromise on tax matters, at least today.
Galston plans two phases in the fighting between the White House and the Congressional Republicans.
The first will come next year in the form of partisan confrontations, as the Republicans challenge Obama in terms of budget, taxes and health care; then be followed by a period of greater bipartite cooperation.
What would be the cause of the change?
Public opinion.
There is ample evidence that, despite the partisan spirit of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want both parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to a stalemate, as in 1995, then both parties will carefully observe the reaction of the public.
Whoever is judged to be in loss will have to change course and find compromises.
But that would be an optimistic view.
The partisan spirit and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than there was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as a mere prelude to a more consistent election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civility displayed this week could be appreciated by many Americans.
But much more effort will be needed on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
Disclosed U.S. documents describe Moscow as a haven of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of a "Kleptocracy" and brings some of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, reported the US Embassy in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Security Service are carrying out huge rackets that help explain the high cost of life in Moscow, he said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical power" - takes its share as money moves up the ladder.
The memorandum, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its website.
The note is based on sources whose names have been expurged.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and he is largely held responsible for corruption.
He was dismissed in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there have since been few traces of clean-up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who owns a leading construction company, have always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several libel suits on these accusations.
In September, he told a Russian television station, when he was questioned about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's to throw away, it's anything."
The Russians believe, by an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to polls.
But it is unusual to find the information contained in an embassy report; and it is unheard of to conceive that it would be for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
The direct link between the Moscow city government and crime led some people to call it "dysfunctional" and to claim that the government functioned more like a kleptocracy than a government, "according to the Embassy's note.
"The criminal elements enjoy a" krysha "(term used in the criminal world / the mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the entire bureaucracy of the Moscow city government.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The FSB, the MVD and the militias are on the second level."
"Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill a gap in certain areas where the city does not provide certain services."
The report indicates that the FSB is raising money from larger companies and that the police are targeting small businesses.
One source, he said, "explained that business owners in Moscow understood that it was better to obtain the protection of the MVD and FSB (rather than organized crime groups) because they not only have more weapons, more means and more power than criminal groups but are also protected by law."
"This is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer so high."
The note points out that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself may be uneven; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly have their business shut down under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but has admitted that little progress has been made.
The Embassy's note transmits reports of men bringing suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on bureaucrats," said Gueorgui Satarov, director of Moscow's think tank Indem, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of a political class because it does not exist in Russia."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
According to the Indem, the costs of corruption in Russia as a whole would amount to over $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked at least at best corrupt).
The disclosure of the note from the US Embassy, which was made only yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, will certainly stir up discontent within the Russian government; although Luzhkov may be blamed, to some extent, for Moscow's failures, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Putin hypothesized that WikiLeaks' documents could be a fabrication and reacted with anger to the remarks that US diplomats had disclosed by calling him Batman and bringing Medvedev closer to Robin.
"The problem is that it is about our interaction, an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he says.
"But to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, as you know, in opposition to ethics."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to face the past
In a poorly lit classroom with low-quality decepted concrete walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School referred to the man who had built it, the last Khmer Rouge chief, Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Known as "the butcher" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Khmer Rouge, this commander remains popular in this isolated stronghold of former Khmer Rouge in northwest Cambodia where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-standing loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to face publicly the people who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that, for the first time, teaches Khmer Rouge history to the children of its former soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly led by the United Nations, handed down its first sentence concerning a former Khmer Rouge member, sentencing the former leader of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture centre, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch," to 35 years in prison.
In the face of these developments, anxiety has increased among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Anlong Veng, complicating reconciliation efforts and their willingness to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodia Documentation Centre, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, approximately 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the United Pol Pot government in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
There, they launched an uprising that lasted until the last of the movements arrived in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the western mountains of Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a suite in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect the government, culminating in the capitulations of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Hangrek.
He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending trial.
Without their benefactors, most Khmer Rouge veterans have fallen into black poverty, common to the rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic of the movement.
Although some elite Khmer Rouge officers have held their positions as local leaders in exchange for laying down arms, they are unskilled farmers of low rank and file.
"These people benefited from very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are imbibed with the Utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raised in a context where doing business is a foreign concept."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Your Mok feeds everyone."
But now life is difficult because we have to support ourselves. "
The current Khmer Rouge Court has also caused concern here.
The court should, at the beginning of next year, start the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court's mandate is to try the senior leaders and the main perpetrators of the crimes, but it did not say whether it continued beyond these four cases.
It would take more to calm Anlong Veng's fears.
The latest media speculation turned to Im Chaem, 64 years old, former district chief in Banteay Meanchey province under the rule of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodia Documentation Centre that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers were reportedly killed.
Recently, during a torrid evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the field near his wooden house on pilotis, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the dried grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past within the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said, she would refuse to go.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said.
"If there is more prosecution, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court prosecuted several suspects; although experts and historians dispute this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is all Cambodia needs to do to move forward, says Yuk Chhang, from the documentation center.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is to reconnect broken pieces," he says.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The centre produced the first government-approved manual on the Khmer Rouge, "A 75-page history of Democratic Kampuchea."
He distributed it in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the ties of the city to the regime.
19-year-old Touch Valeak, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new manual helped students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he came home with the book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he says.
"They are suspicious because they don't know exactly how many people the court will pursue."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, said Sok Leang.
But the public forums, the manual and the court are starting to have an impact, he said.
Yet the Khmer Rouge keep a powerful lure here.
In the heights of the mountains of Hangrek, a path, invaded by weeds and sprinkled with plastic bags, leads to a black soot rectangle, covered with a rusty sheet roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Noom Sothea, 31 years old, a roadside mobile phone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a great spirit; and many inhabitants go there to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later that day she planned to walk to the last resting place in Pol Pot where she would leave a bouquet of ripe bananas in the hope of bringing luck.
Belarus agrees to renounce its military-grade uranium stock
The government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will abandon its stockpile of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is part of a surprise victory of President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear materials worldwide
The agreement was disclosed in a joint communiqué issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the margins of a security summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring.
But American officials told the Washington Post that some classified operations have been carried out with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of military grade uranium from a research centre in Belarus.
This paved the way for an agreement on Wednesday to eliminate the remainder of the matter by about £500, according to a staff member who referred to the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit, held at the initiative of Obama, where Belarus was excluded.
Apparently, it has been beneficial to obtain an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I'm really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
"This proves to me that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a nuclear security advocacy group.
Clinton described the agreement as "a very significant and important step" by Belarus.
Obama pledged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world in the next four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko said that the nation would never give up its uranium.
"We kept highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially military grade uranium and low enriched uranium," said Lukashenko.
"It's our product... we're not gonna make dirty bombs, and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We're just going to use it for research, that's all."
Belarus moved closer to the United States a few months ago; however, by showing interest in reaching an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, said officials.
It was loaded on a special train that travelled over 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and disposed of, said officials.
The second operation was completed on Monday and was conducted by air, according to officials.
The US government has spent $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Belarus's research facilities with low enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons.
"Careful coordination and organization have been put in place to build confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a head of the Department of Energy specializing in Global Threat Reduction.
According to estimates from the James Martin Nonproliferation Study Center, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of military grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of kilos of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus is seeking to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint declaration.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential renewal.
"While welcoming progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains essential for improving bilateral relations; and essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she said.
The government did not object to CIA flights
The government did not object to CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners to Guantanamo across Spanish territory, according to a telegram from the US ambassador to Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the daily El País, adding that the first vice-president of the Government of that time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had requested that the Spanish Executive be informed in order to "prove that they exercised adequate vigilance on foreign planes crossing Spain."
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in practices contrary to human rights, a meeting was held between former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "surprised the Government of Zapatero out of the game" and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the theft of intelligence over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed," says Aguirre in a cable.
The holder of the Ministry of External Affairs of that time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, told the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this case the lowest possible profile, even if, as it was in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence."
In turn, in January 2007, Prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that he was not going to block the judge's initiative to request the de-classification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after speaking with the prosecutor.
The United States has nevertheless shown its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the declassified information of CNI o of the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to manipulate the case discreetly between governments," regrets Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a luncheon between the US Ambassador and the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are madly jealous of his independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his collaborators "to avoid comments of a flaming rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expressed concern for the PP's action in this matter.
"Despite its overall pro-American orientation, our experience suggests that PP will certainly take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the United States Government," she points out.
The parricide that passed to confession complained in a network of the "indulgence" of being a mother
The girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror to the Galician."
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname she used as soon as she was little, she communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two from Noia, the village of La Coruña from which she originated.
The messages date back to 2008.
To hear them, one must know his sentimental life, which ABC builds with the help of his parents' testimonies.
The 30-year-old Galician girl had initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
Their relationship lasted a year.
Shortly after they split up, we knew she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him do the DNA test.
We discovered another new boyfriend shortly after that.
The elected member was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighbouring municipality.
With him, she lived together for a long time.
Caesar had lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But according to the content of his communications, we hear that their idyll broke up, they split up.
In March of 2008 she was alone in Minorca and wrote: "Alberto is very strange and offended for the fact that I came to work there."
"When I told him, it seemed a good thing to him, but of course he now realizes what it means to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants."
And then she's talking about a mobile message she just got: "I want you to come home this month or give me an address to send you the child."
Ella complains, "If she doesn't like it, let him leave the kid with my mother, and I'll take her when I get home," she says.
In May, she talks about the return to her village: "This week I am leaving, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to report to a work station so as not to lose it."
She explains that if everything went well, she would have taken her eldest with her.
"He will remain with the correct person, that is, with me, and I will never leave him in my life with another person if that person is not my mother," dubious intention, taking into account their bad relations.
In July, there's another post.
When she hits him, it is assumed that the child, who had arrived at the island on the 1st of that month, and had allegedly been murdered on the 10th, died.
"Caesar is happy on one side, but he is not happy on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and this place he likes a little, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
She's talking about a trip to Mallorca.
"There will be [the child] in a few hours of summer and so I save a little money from the babysitter."
On the 17th, greetings and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
"Alberto says he sent you some videos to the e-mail, you know, whenever he wants, he finds me, shit."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to the summer hours to learn Catalan.
On Víctor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the Internet she has messages in blogs dedicated to animation and manga.
She had one of her own in the MySpace universe, now blocked, where her name was "Muki the prison liberator."
"Terror with the Galician (epigrapher)."
The last man who lived with her, vigil, declared his regret to feel guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything had gone so that she hadn't told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica entered Palma Provincial Prison yesterday from the Minorca Judicial Detention Centre.
Ex officio lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she does not remember how the facts happened, "nor did she intend to harm the minor."
Before she confessed to drowning Caesar in the bathtub and putting his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor have asked for a psychiatric test.
Members of the People's Party would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats
With the results of the 18-N, the PP could be decisive in the munitions of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the large increase in votes and deputies recorded in the last autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already targeted the generals because, even if there is progress or not, the prospects are more than positive, because the number of votes this formation obtains in these comices normally doubles that it receives in the Catalan.
For example, the Catalan people obtained 610,473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomics they obtained 316,222 votes.
Last Sunday, the PPC received 384,091 votes.
If we maintain this upward trend, desired by a diversion of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, the analysts of this formation calculated the fact that, if there were general elections, the CPP could increase from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while CiU would also gain four (it now has 10) and PSC would lose neither more nor less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
These scales would find that the Catalan place is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to the popular analysis, ERC would lose a Member of Parliament - he has three now - while ICV would keep a Member of Parliament or win one.
But if the electoral agenda continues, the next meeting would take place in May of 2011 for municipal committees, where the people can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relay at the head of the General Council of Barcelona, one of the administrations that manipulates the higher budget - 661 million euros for 2011-.
Both the nationalists and the popular agree that PSC could lose the mayors of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would also not get the majority of the opportunity to use their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Taking into account the republican debacle, it would not be fantasy that this formation loses its representation in the city hall of Barcelona - it is necessary to obtain the 5% of the votes -.
The PP has increased its voting number in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the fall in the capital of Tarragona, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP recorded only a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, whose mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they found themselves several times.
Popular people have also made progress in other important facilities such as Badalona, Castelldefels and Reus.
The PP is now present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in a maximum number of localities.
Catalan cell facilitated thousands of passports in Al Qaeda
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, Thailand, there were three.
The seven Pakistani and Nigerians detained by agents of the General Information Commission of the Barcelona Police Force formed a jihadist cell which, led from Thailand, facilitated passports to various Al Qaeda groups, including "Tigers for the Liberation of Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar e Taiba" (Let), the last of which was the perpetrator of the Bombay attacks that killed 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" "was" debilitated "Al Qaeda's apparatus of falsification at the international level and" therefore its operational capacity. "
Investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years that it was active in Catalonia, was able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, or they were falsified and then distributed to groups that were integrating the Al Qaeda criminal galaxy so that its "fighters" could cross European and other Western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is the only one that the jihadist network held operative in Europe, which is why in the investigations involved, apart from the Thai services, other European police units, which is why in the territory of the European Union there could be similar blows in the following days to that recorded on Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (detention of the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade), another was carried out in Thailand, with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
They were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the conditions marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front."
That is, the documents had to be in the name of young men between the ages of 25 and 45, with a validity of several years and without stamped visas.
Investigators point out that so far no details have been found that connect detainees in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, even though the perpetrator of the attack, "Laskar e Taiba," was one of the receiving groups of passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it must be recalled that a few days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia a few thousand dollars were sent through a transfer agency that were "invested" in order to buy mobile cards that were used after by the integrants of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
The police seized extensive documentation.
PP asks Mas to suspend tax complicity
PPC leader Alicia Sánchez-Camacho had the opportunity yesterday to personally explain to Artur Mas his conditions to support his inauguration as president of the Generalitat, identical to those exhibited during the campaign, which consists in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philo-sovereign adventures as is the economic complicity that the nationalist leader wishes to address at half of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people arrived at the meeting with Artur Mas with the security that gives the fact to have obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, a more than enough number to be loved, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the formations that the opposition will exercise abstain in the vote of the nomination.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress during the general elections, but, for the moment, the conversations that Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made in Catalan key.
And as far as the President of the PP is concerned, in order to support an investiture "we should eliminate all the sovereign and independence speeches," and the economic complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader wishes to submit even to the referendum.
The two leaders have in common their bet to make the political apparatus of a very exaggerated autonomy administration and the elimination of the tax applied to successions and donations.
Details of the Mas investiture negotiations will be handled by PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who has promised a hard opposition -, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to the "lack of measures"
The owners of the Olot center do not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse killed more than 11 elderly people
The officials of the Geriatrics La Caritat d'Olot (Girona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the harm caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for whom he was responsible in the meantime.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, presented himself accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "La Caritat's desire would be to be able to charge the person responsible" for the dead but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civilian officials."
And apart from the social discredit that the entity may suffer for failing to detect in time the criminal activities of the night nurse, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of a substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' parents already calculate.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that from that day on he continued to kill.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former geriatric patients - care he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, given the age and pathologies of the patients, formality took place by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what happened at any time."
Counsel for La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indication of imprudence on the part of any other person who is the accused."
The person already named "The Angel of Death" confessed the day before yesterday 11 murders and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29 August 2009 and a month and a half later he killed a second grandmother.
In this case he caused her death by injecting a sober dose of insulin, unlike the first crime he had committed with a mix of sedative pastilles.
The director of La Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control the access of the staff of the centre to medicines.
Insulin injections and sedative cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analyses will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he sought a less cruel death for his first victims or instead he burned them inside by washing them as he already confessed that he did with the three women he killed in the interval 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the nurse at night, nor the number of murders admitted, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number being greater and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they declare that they will remain at the disposal of justice to clarify the scope of the facts.
ECB threat
Investors reacted abruptly yesterday to Trichet's threat that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
Peripheral differentials have closed to strength and European banks have suffered more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has barely recorded an increase, which is a worrying signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market which in the same way as it collapses, it recovers, but motivated by fences of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and the remaining ones.
Bundesbank required the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited weekly access.
After the Irish crisis, it is hoped that the current liquidity measures will be extended "at least until March" and that the quarterly unrestricted auction will be maintained at the end of the quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We hope that we will continue with the bond purchase programme and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will overthrow the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, may God help us!
As well as during their May meeting in which they said that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and they collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka Monday and Wednesday he said that he had already bought a lot, causing another collapse on the market.
Yesterday the one-year auction in Portugal was very poor.
The Treasury issued only 500 million at 5.28% compared to 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Even so, the types in Portugal have dropped 30 basis points throughout the curve, and clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland the figures for the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures represent 10.000 million in the short term and 15.000 potential and they have a delay until February to obtain private capital or they will be nationalised.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are insurmountable in the Assistance Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
Nevertheless, next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it does not yet have sufficient support, therefore Ireland remains in a place of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel moderated the tone of her speech in order to ease the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a union and that we all interpret the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest the hymn of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday the plan of measures that the Council of Ministers will approve on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to reactivate employment sound to investors like the four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double Trichet and ZP effect explains the fact that the Spanish stock exchange received 4.5%, the double that the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain was rapid and radical and we are enjoying the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect, therefore we hope that it resolves with strong demand and helps dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Assistance Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40,000 million available liquidity, triple that of March, to very expensive types and they cut off access to markets sine die.
Nevertheless, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's wife, "apart from being, it appears."
Courage, we can get through this!
President of Eulen to challenge the council of Vega Sicilia requested by his sons
The storm does not cease in the open conflict within the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, founder of the group, will contest, because he considers him "null and void," the judicial council of El Enebro the next 16, requested by five of his seven sons in which they will try to assert their majority and seize the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José grant their legal battery for the new chapter of their dispute for the control of one part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding company of business services for the companies does not seem to be willing to cede in his dispute to be present in the management bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was excluded by five of his seven sons who named themselves directors in the shareholders' meeting of January 18 this year whose challenge is registered in the Registry of Commerce and Corporations.
The judicial council of El Enebro for the next 16, convened by the Magistrate Commercial Number 2 in Madrid, has again opened the box of thunder within the Álvarez family.
The use of the judge to determine the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convening of the assembly.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is described by David Álvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants his five sons to try, through a procedural argument, by clearly defrauding the Law and abusing the law, to validate and correct the radically null assembly on January 18," according to his official spokespersons.
This argument will be the basis for, once the assembly is held, to be challenged, considering that the assembly is "null and void as of right."
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully that the magistrate convenes an assembly in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, the sons of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
Nevertheless, the founder of the service group asks for usufruct on 51% of the capital, according to familiar protocols.
This case is the substantive issue that the judge must decide after the hearing on the challenge application for which there is not yet a date reported.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret Siemens weapon
Software creates improvements on real-time cars.
As soon as Red Bull entered the Formula One world in 2004, his history in this select universe of speed was marked by surprise and success.
In a first moment, no one took into account the options of a new stable that had just arrived, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they all bet on the triumph of Ferrari by Fernando Alonso.
Without lowering the champion's skill as a pilot, the German Sebastien Vette, nor the Renault engine's ability to drive his car, in the Formula One world we are talking about the legend of the "secret weapon" that the multinational company Siemens put in the hands of Red Bull to transform him into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with goals far away from the high motorist competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument has been used to create assembly chains for manufacturing plants all over the world, power stations, high precision instruments.
The objective is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable defects and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that the use of this computer instrument in its Formula 1 plant allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes, changes and improvements detected during races and trials.
Russwurm explains that the 1992 stables had an average of 10 technicians in their teams who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season.
In Red Bull's team, 180 young professionals of high quality are working today, who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project any kind of modifications to the cars.
Siemens' manager explained that PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of Red Bull's cars except the engine, which is the exclusive responsibility of Renault.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety features are modified.
Changes can be made from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced high-tech laser and autoclave production systems.
As the only limitation of this madness of technological development there is the $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as a limit each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech plant to create and produce its cars in a locality 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are restricted.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret."
The staff for this assignment consists of 580 people, including two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull's Formula One hero, no doubt, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Between the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and the notoriety zero.
The plant's technology manager, Steve Nevey, says five years ago it could be said that R & D advances in racing cars accounted for 50% of the victories and the drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85% of the success, while the pilots bring 15% of the added value.
Nevey admits that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, because "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will install in two years 20 clean stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened its first exclusive store in Barcelona in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
It will be the first in the network of 20 shops between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will account for this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers like PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP Spain's vice-president, Helena Herrero, gave an example of the redesigned store located on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, property of Pont Reyes, with which she has been collaborating for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to establish 200 branded outlets in Europe in 2013, which includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first opened were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, with Barcelona as the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible stores, even though she confessed that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HM personal systems assured that the philosophy for the establishment of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and deals with the design of exclusive store furniture (with products that can be touched in an interactive way), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of school staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it is a franchise system and pointed out that the exclusive network of shops claims "to improve the service offered to customers and SMEs in the purchase, assistance, post-sale and even packaging."
The Barcelona store includes a space with a world-class pioneering pilot program that solves the potential problems of HP's computer equipment as a warranty.
An online service connects with a technical center located in Maastricht (Holland).
"So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take even two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, as the big companies have already contracted technical assistance services," said Helena Herrero yesterday.
Sabadell bets on 'steal' a million customers to its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, the managing director of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks 2011 will be a tough year for the banking sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liability war.
Despite this, it predicts a collapse in interest margins, which will be partially offset by increases in commissions and credit prices.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million individual customers, his task to accomplish.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit for the next three years and thus be able to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new three-year master plan in 2011.
The objective, apart from surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public subsidies, is to gain a market rating through the capture of a million new individual customers - 700,000 if one deduces those who can get out of the bank - its great task to accomplish, because until now this bank had spoiled more SMEs and companies than the particular customer.
This year he has collected 250,000 individual customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market rating to individuals is 3.5%, while to companies it exceeds 10%.
Another basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the productivity bet, or what is the same thing, austerity, with cost reduction as an objective, whose provocations will be explained by the bank when it presents the results of the exercise.
Few banks now dare to set targets and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all plans in the global banking sector.
Sabadell, in fact, will finalize this year its Optima master plan, established four years ago, even though initially the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its extension for one more exercise.
The main objective of the project will be the clients who let the savings crates escape.
During a breakfast organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental" year.
The executive, in fact, believes that the recovery from the crisis in Spain "will be slow."
Moreover, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs," which is fundamental to the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And even if he thinks that the liability war - which penalizes margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that banks and funds pay for its issues to obtain liquidity is already moving at the price of credit to compensate for the fall in margins.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a factor of pressure on credit."
"We didn't tighten the tap, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and increase the price of differentials - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November -.
He also admitted that the banking sector's trend now "is to increase commissions," but "there is a competitive framework."
Sabadell's master plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of carrying out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "larger dimensions will be sought."
"Everything will move next year," he said.
He claims that capital requirements "increase dramatically" and some Spanish financial entity could enter the red numbers.
He mentioned that FROB could replace the market in the collection of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After having assured that Sabadell can survive the time closure of the markets, he diminished the importance of the fact that some banks already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He pointed out that it was not possible to issue, but contrary to what had happened in June, short-term financing could be obtained through rest, thus reducing the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second wave of mergers among the caisses
The Director-General of ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of a new wave of savings fund mergers and reiterated the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When the Spanish savings fund merger process began, there were several entities that assured that they were not going to participate in this first phase and that they were reserving for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director General of the Spanish Confederation of Caisses d'Epargne (ECSC), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility of producing this new wave of operations.
"I think that most of the mergers have been carried out, it cannot be said that the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group is a second phase, they are adjustments."
"Most have been completed completely; instead of 17, it is possible to go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been carried out under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in this operation too," stressed the leader.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is being carried out "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied with the way it is being carried out within the deadlines set in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphasized.
"The change from 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million of assets to 17 with 75,500 million is an unparalleled process in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be compliant with Basel," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there is a rather unhappy set of opinions on the slowness of the process" which demonstrate "a lack of serosity and sense," because "what the Bank of Spain is doing is to remind that the deadline must be respected before the end of the year."
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all Europe and "probably" in the world and attributed to those who question it a "lack of knowledge."
The leader mentioned that given the current economic situation, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and savings funds, a system that has begun a process of concentration "very important" and "goes as fast as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector had been well off from the stress tests that ECB had carried out in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has opted to remain in the euro, but it has laid down the conditions for the whole Union.
The tensions in the markets have led to a lofty government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has announced new methods of adjustment, which vary from tax reductions for SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or abolition of the 426 euros of assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of Lotteries of the State.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, joins with Chancellor Angela Merkel's criticism of her responsibility to detach the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
It should be noted that Merkel's position is not an error in his communicative policy.
On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future should be, which shocks that of maintaining the old traditions of most of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible exits from the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and the south would abandon the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems science fiction, with a very favourable current of opinion, almost 50% of the population.
The third, a new conception of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries that transgress them, possible suspensions of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and it has been defined for a long time, so now there is no room for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought should be done (fiscal rigour plans and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, were doing.
The second blow by the Central European country was when Merkel difficult to prolong the decision to save Greece.
From that moment on it was the subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel once again expressed a clear position, calling for the reform of the Union's treaties in order to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear a share of the cost.
This position was interpreted as anti-European, as it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although somewhat watered down, has been approved and, in the following months, we should be attending the process of reform of the Union which makes these measures possible from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not expect to cross.
And she tells us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which we may not agree too much, from that date on the old functioning of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which countries that break the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to declare themselves in cessation of payments and, in this case, the private sector will also bear a share of the costs.
Germany points out that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated.
The bet is clear.
And it would be wrong not to hear it.
It is not just a question of extending the government deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we're being asked is much harder.
And what he absolutely must not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will bring greater tranquillity to us.
And let us know how to seize the opportunity we were given, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero also heard him in this form and his double declaration (the reforms promised after the past meeting on Saturday with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of the new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticism, we have opened the way to the thesis that we must put order at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considering, we cannot exclude the possibility of abandoning a monetary zone that is too crowded with countries that are not serious.
And in that case, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
The tricks similar to that of Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrate ingenuity but not the will to escape punishment.
The expulsion in principle by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the 23 November match against Ajax in the Champions League gave a lot of ink on the anti-sporting character of such behaviour and whether the two players should be sanctioned by the UEFA.
As we know, a few minutes before finishing the game (which their team was already winning clearly), the two players deliberately lost time when they made mistakes to determine the referee to show them the second yellow card.
So, since Real Madrid will eventually be the leader of its group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the barrage against Auxerre and will be able to pass without cartons in the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA discipline committee has sanctioned the team coach, José Mourinho and various economic sums to the players involved with two games.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances like this or similar is not a new practice, if not more common in the football world.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate in the related case owes to the fact that this had as protagonist a team of Real Madrid's entity (which in its hymn displays nobility and honor and which on past occasions has fined its players for similar acts) and to the orchestrated dramatization, apparently, by Mourinho, which adds one more episode to its dilated history of Histrionic and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate asks whether this type of behaviour, which is not expressly prohibited by the regulation, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions commit a fraud of law; for, in fact, they are actions respectful of the sporting regulation, but seem to evade its meaning.
The question is to examine the type of harm they cause to the sportsmanship.
One of the assets that includes sportsmanship is the physical integrity of opposing players, an aspect that with these actions has not been put in danger, that is, there has been no violent play.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with the correct game is to prevent the offending players team from taking unfair advantage of the opposing team, which is not the case either.
However, the paradoxical fact of the action of Real Madrid players is that it does not accommodate what is normally characterized as cheating or fraud of the law, because its violation of the rules was not carried out in secret in order to try to avoid punishment, but their action precisely tried to be as obvious as possible in order to receive the penalisation of the arbitrator.
They were waiting and they willingly accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of benefit that offenders obtain from the intentional misconduct examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that we do not put the rival at a disadvantage and we do not get an advantage in the same match either, because obviously the result of the action presupposes leaving their own team with fewer players.
And it's not a useful strategy for the next game either, because the club couldn't count on these players.
Of course the advantage is that the players will start the next phase of the Champions League without boxes that could threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indetermination, because the team could be eliminated suddenly and apart from that, with this action the players complete a penalty match and move on to the second cycle of cartons, in which the suspension due to the accumulation of cartons occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
So, climbing the ladder, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
In the end, these actions are not contrary to the sporting spirit, which is still part of the strategic decision-making that promotes the maximum profit of what the rules allow.
In our case, the players did not operate to avoid the application of the sanction (it would indeed be a clear case of fraud of the law), m otherwise they chose rather the moment in which they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision without defeating the penalty or fleeing that penalty.
Even though the boundary between the genius and the fraud of the law is diffuse, on this occasion I think we have had a clear case of genius.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises because of two factors: because there were two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the director was transmitted to provoke them.
The harm caused to the principles of sport by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to receive Christmas dinners for groups in NCBs
The dictatorship of the calendar is concentrating this year an avalanche of reservations for days 16 and 17.
There is a proliferation of self-funded celebrations by employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
Like turon and lottery, when December arrives also dinner groups before Christmas that continue to be the oxygen balloon for restaurants and entertainment in Barcelona, but that because of the crisis have led to an offensive price adjusted to be able to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, coincide the businessmen and associations of the sector interviewed.
To complete the complicated accounting, this year's calendar (as New Year's Eve falls on Friday) concentrated requests in the week of December 13, resulting so far in an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (the 17th and 17th) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult times, there are many companies that have eliminated group dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain tradition, many employees organize them by paying for their own pockets.
Any is the situation, they all ask for battle prices, confirms the president of Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the employers, now, does not dare to predict how the holidays will be this month.
"People think a lot before they book."
"They want to go out, but they pay a lot of attention to the prices," he says.
The case will go well "for those who give quality at good price and with good service," he adds, and recalls that customers tend to lower a step with the crisis, so that the tranche around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey of various establishments in the centre, there was a collapse of requests for the night of the 17th.
The Soteras Group says that there is a genuine boom of requests for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than 30 euros, to which they responded by adapting their menus to the economic situation, with complete formulas of 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has assumed more advance reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We did everything we could to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes of 19.95 to 30 euros," they say.
AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 premises, remains optimistic after detecting a boom in invoicing since the second semester and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group mention that the 18th will also be a hyper-active day at the level of groups of friends who celebrate the holidays in advance.
To their six group menus they added one for Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend a 10% more than last year instead of requiring more details, such as Catalan wine manufactured according to the Champenois method - 'cava'.
They also see the first signs of improvement in some companies again inviting their employees and the feeling that the volume of the groups has increased a little.
From the employers Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Entertainment of Barcelona), its vice-president, Enric Gomà, entrusts in the possibility of starting to see the final of the tunnel and maintains that overall the reservations are "animated," even if the customers "negotiate to the maximum."
That is true, the hope for festivities has not diminished, regardless of who pays, he says.
Pakistan's nuclear programme generates great concern in the United States
Islamabad produces atomic weapons "at a faster pace than any other country."
Wikileaks filtration confirms the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy of Pakistan and the US Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concern that Pakistan's nuclear programme is causing in Washington.
Apart from the enlightening and tasty details on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases" and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world."
The particularity of Pakistan's nuclear programme - the fact that weapons are not assembled, but are stored by components to make them difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
For example, Ambassador Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan listed in a report before the visit of former National Security Adviser James Jones: "The proximity of certain nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersion of nuclear materials whose noise is short and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials."
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is seen, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason for maintaining custody.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given lower educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," said expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs during a meeting with his American counterparts.
The new material filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever smaller cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high level of Pakistan's production of nuclear armas.
An embassy dispatch in May, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating," supports the following: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence official for southern Asia, notes that "despite the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also asked Washington, during a visit by Army Leader General Ashfaq Kayani, to make it "very clear" to the official that "the Pakistan Army must end with tacit support for terrorist groups."
Hunting Wikileaks Chief
Obama will appoint a senior counter-terrorist officer to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol is issuing a red alert to track movements and locate in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have any certainty about the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track Assange's movements."
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, otherwise it dates from 20 November.
And this one has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, Wikileaks' creator lawyer Mark Stephens assured that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
On the 20th the international police force based in Lyon (France) dictated the order at the request of Sweden, but it did not make it public until yesterday, after having received permission from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have been advised to identify or locate Assange "to obtain his provisional arrest and extradition."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, according to the organization's explanations, consider the call red notice a free way for arrest -- which the national police force must carry out -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The movement outraged Assange's lawyers, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks was willing to respond by video conference to the Swedish authorities' questions.
They also recall that Assange applied for and obtained the permit to leave Sweden from the prosecutor's office in his case, which is compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of security at Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive denounced.
While the world is looking for him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's innocence - Assange continues to be in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday he granted an interview from an undetermined place to the director of the magazine Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that she was responsible for giving orders to the American graduates they spy on at the United Nations by violating the international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was insulted yesterday by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the resignation request as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure at all why a guy's opinion with a web page should interest us," he said for the CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior counter-terrorism official, Rusell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to reduce Assange's importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will be chairing the National Security Committee in the Lower House in January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to confiscate his funds and prosecute anyone who provides them with contributions or assistance."
Even further went Tom Flanagan, an advisor to Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to revisit his statements after saying that Assange would have to "be murdered."
"Obama should turn it into an objective and use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
One person who did not ask for an apology was Mike Huckabee, Baptist Minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever is in the Government that filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not an execution would be too kind punishment," he said for Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC with clins of eye to Carod's followers
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the recipe to solve the umpteenth internal revolt within ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes.
The party president is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now as dilute as its liar and that it cannot at all give him headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
That's why Esquerra's leader will try to win his new critics with clicks of eye that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national ERC advisers will be able to comment on its continuity in secret.
By ballot, not by raising your hand.
If the Carodists want to send a certain penalty vote to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews he said that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "in Bulgarian" would not be good either.
The people close to Carod demand a little more from the president than to put his position at the disposal of the militancy, a gesture that is not worth it when Puigcercós controls the maxim organ between the congresses.
But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignation, they will try to agree with the executive on a road map until May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that management will submit to the National Council for vote on the 18th.
His intention is to support Puigcercós in exchange for his promise to schedule the congress for the fall of 2011, which the leaders consider to be a sure fact.
The ERC leader has admitted that "polyphony" affects stability and that its goal is to ensure that once and for all the organization is able to wash its laundry room with the family.
In this line, the article that current advisor Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange for various objectives" is as if it had been done.
And he listed five of them, of which he points out two.
The first, "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new figures that come from the adept sector of Carod.
The second can be the character of great news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the assembly as an operating mechanism.
Thus, he defends a reform of the statutes that allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by suffrage.
Finishing with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish party system, was an obsession of the Puigcercós team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the conclave conclave of 2008 instructed management to revise the assembly model in a specific convention of reform of the statutes.
This meeting remains unfinished, as the internal tide of recent years did not recommend addressing this issue.
Now, without critical areas on the lookout, the time could be right to take it back and shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 in 2010
According to the MILENIO of the State of Mexico, there was a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to MILENIO of the State of Mexico.
Between the murders these three women are mentioned and the discovery of two bodies cut in Valle de México.
In the penultimate month of the year there were 390 deaths in theory related to organized crime.
Between the cases we mention that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the blow of grace to the head, apart from the feet and hands tied with a cable.
The next day, the corpse of a subject was found in a suitcase inside the luggage port of an abandoned vehicle in Mixtecas Street in the Colonia Santa Cruz Acatlán, municipality of Naucalpan.
Very early in the morning on Thursday, the fourth, the owners of jointly exploited lands found a body with signs of torture and at least three lethal shots in the thorax, on the autopist near Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the area that crosses the municipality Villa Guerrero.
Near the body we found a message signed in theory by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl a 50-year-old gentleman was murdered with eight gunshots when he was leaving his house to initiate garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were killed by a gunshot impact on the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the coup de grâce in the front, the corpse of a man was found on a lonely road from Colonia El Naranjo and under the body was found a bullet hit with a calibre 25 firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the black water channel of the Plaza Golondrina settlement.
The emergency corps conducted a thorough search of the rest of the body members, but they were not found.
The residents of Tepotzotlán alerted to the discovery of a corpse in Peña Colorada, with their hands tied behind and their eyes blindfolded.
The man had a gunshot wound in his neck.
In the middle of the month it was reported that two men had been executed which had been wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the Villas de la Hacienda department in the municipality Atizapán de Zaragoza, two death warning messages were discovered at the same time with the victims.
One day later, a box of cardboard containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony it was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by L'Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found in the Zoquiapan hamlet of the municipality of Ixtamaluca and the following morning the corpse of a Huixquilucan man who had been wrapped in a yellow and blue blanket, being in principle identified with the name Mario Ríos, agreed with a message that his executors had left beside him.
In Ixtamaluca, with gunshots in the neck, the dead body of a woman was found in the hamlet of San Francisco Acuautla.
Tattoos from Santa Muerte and necklaces with her image were detected on the woman's skin.
Towards the end of the month, a man's corpse was found on the edge of a car in Zinacantepec municipality with at least three bullet hits and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of two men with their head wrapped and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message signed in principle by a criminal organization, which said: "This is what is happening with those who do not align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and hands and feet attached, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre of the San Agustín colony.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the ammunition of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first of them had been beheaded in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and had been wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a cinnamon ribbon and a message beside it; while the second had been tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Near him, the agents found a bristol with a message.
China maintains targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country in COP16 assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and detailed that he maintained his offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 per cent until 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions between 40 and 45 per cent by 2020, said Su Wei, the country's COP16 representative.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the trace of coal and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, his country had inverted $245 million over the past four years in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Nevertheless, he had made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but it would continue to work together with the international community in that area.
He mentioned that China's climate change strategy is divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; institution-building and pilot programme support.
Progress has been made in all these areas, including the approval last year of a new Energy Law, which recognises the objectives discussed with regard to the reduction of greenhouse gases, he explained.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated manner with government and local governments to achieve energy savings, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, he said, there are various multi-year plans under way or completed, both financed by the Chinese government and by the governments of other countries.
For example, he mentioned, the Efficient Use of Energy Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations, the Government and the private sector.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for changing incandescent lamps by saving lamps, and another for mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the government's scientific advisor on climate change, assured that China's efforts have been greater than thought.
For example, he explained, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9% of the historical contribution to contamination.
Similarly, it has made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase energy efficiency by 20% in the last five years and plans to make it another similar around 2020, he said.
Legal Expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The National Leader of PAN explained that the former Panist leader has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
The national leader of PAN, César Nava Vázquez assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former leader of the Panist has the right to address the National Order Commission to claim what is right.
In the interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo's protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Commission of Order of Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to complain, if necessary, to the Commission of Order of the National Council, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he has made it clear that this is not the time to think about 2012 and there has never been an alliance on the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his conviction that Acción Nacional would be stronger after the internal elections on 4 and 5 December, when a successor should be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiating table, at least for the time being, it has been an approach to local elections that has been successful and achieved its goal," he said.
The panist leader mentioned that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is why "internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary," we enjoy it and make us stronger, "he said.
He said that the council will probably be able to elegant the best leader Acción Nacional needs for the next three years, so it would give the "person determined by the council" the relief.
"I am completely quiet and open, I would be proud to leave the office of party president to any of the five."
He anticipated that the party's revival in the July 4 elections would be reflected on the next dispute, although "it's not yet time to think about 2012."
"For the moment it is a question of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments that emanate from the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be a reason for observation throughout the country, so that we have made ourselves "a lot of hopes for them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to the expectations."
When asked about PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his speech during his four years of government, César Nava asked the priists to reflect on the six years of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo y Salinas have been better than those of Fox y Calderón; that they begin to defend them; that they come out of the" cabinet, "he said.
He said that the incumbent of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag, and even less censorship.
Obama is promoting the law in Twitter for undocumented students
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," the American president tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama gathered today to mobilize nationally to support the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the Twitter social network.
"If you agree with the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Obama.
His short message maintains a cybernetic link with a larger document that asks the public to contact senators immediately, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote we hope to vote soon, now is the time to listen to your voice," he points out.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation if the extension of Bush's tax cuts and government funding continue.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the passage of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
When asked about the republican blockade of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he was confident that once the tax problem was resolved, an agenda could be set for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this tax problem must be resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at some point and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the Democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask for a "closing vote" for the Dream Act, which is why the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the American Dream Act would legalize 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States before the age of 16, they have remained in that country for the past five years and have been accepted by a higher education institution or the Army.
But supporters need 60 votes to approve the initiative, which is why they need the support of a large number of Republicans, at times when the partisan organizations of the project protagonists an intense lobbying to ensure the approval of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
Nevertheless at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
That is why the supporters of the Dream Act require the vote of several Republicans if other Democrats decide to vote against the initiative.
Among the most courteous Republicans are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the term of office of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported him, John McCain, has not defined his posture so far.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the larger obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With literatures you put your finger on the wound
The second stage of the Plaisirs of the language was a walk in which the participants displayed the narration
"Sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? What is it hoped for from me?," asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the Plaisirs of the language, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to Sex in the language, she explained).
The finger on the wound... "puts us in embarrassment," the Argentinian writer gently threw to the public, most of the young, who had gathered at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz later defined as a great story, with Luisa in first person as protagonist who seeks to know what the "wound" is, she goes from one doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative thread.
From the infectiologist she comes out convinced: "patience is not my strength, it may be my wound."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who breathed his breath in the middle of the corridor, but explains to him that wound is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst that reveals the mystery: "the wound is what is open in reality, the symbolism is the scar."
The protagonist sighed and concluded: "On the wound I could only know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist," but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must be very connected.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also exposed a beautiful narrative that he called Eloge à l'invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at some point is discovered.
With touches of magical realism, he speaks of a famous bewitching woman who touched clouds, brought back people who had gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration that turns to speak then America, the great news that had from the beginning her own chroniclers and quoted to Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticized the excesses of the narrations of the conquering capitans.
"Cervantes who invented all of us (the writers) mocked the false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a way one would never have told the history of America with an imagination that even lacked modesty."
Nevertheless, he stressed, "fools and liars have the best imagination" and here reality converges with lies, it is no longer known what part of the narrative belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its peak.
This is actually called the 'Cervantes tradition'.
"It is thanks to his heritage that we are what we are told."
In turn, the writer Mayra Montyero has annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with his round table Le must on the wound.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican has put her own on the great wound of the social violence that her country is going through - and Latin America shares - produces disputes about the trafficking and sale of drugs.
"I think that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," she said, after mentioning that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment that is established between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero who also stressed "this must be on the wound of the committed writer."
He considered that in a world that lives in high speed also as regards intellectual habits and the control of consciences that turns to the advantage of dogmatism, "behind every assertion there is a little no and behind every negation there is a little yes."
"To be masters of our own feelings and masters of reality, we must nuance: and nuancer means many times putting your finger on the wound and disturbing people who feel very comfortable thinking in cartoon, in white and black, in established ideas and without nuance, and also disturbing the powers that prefer a world in white and black," he said, inviting to regain the meaning of writing.
Romano on the hunt for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finals he had ups and downs in his career, but he managed to reach three times the decisive series.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there are in addition two different styles that confront each other, marked by their technicians, who find between them a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has had three defeats in finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has managed to reach three times the decisive series, even if so far he has not put in the mile and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentinian ended up consoling himself with the sub-champion medal, he stayed a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played consecutive finals.
The Santist strategist came to his first final as a coach in the 2002 Opening Tournament, when he held the reins of Morelia with which he lost with an overall result of 4-2 against Toluca; later, in the Closing 2003 he also reached the decisive duel and lost again with the overall result of 3-1 and it was precisely against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the 2010 Bicentennial Tournament, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered another setback, as his team made a 2-2 match against the Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty series he got an advantage for 3-1 with two chances to get the title and finally three of his players missed by 11 meters and he suffered the jump to the 4-3 result.
Rubén lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his rival at the tournament, so he doesn't want to have the same fate, he tries to get out of the mess so he can celebrate for the first time a title, even if he says that for him the institution is more important.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have and therefore I will get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," commented the helmsman when asked what his weak points would be in the finals.
He remembers a lot of the final last, from which he assures that he learned a lot, "the only lesson we can remember is that until the referee whistles the final, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players too, because the last time, with two penalties to shoot we were already prepared to run and I believe that this is a lesson, before the end of the game we can't celebrate."
He knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry him, because he confides in his players: "We never seek to arrive at the series of penalties, we try to finish within the regular deadline, but sometimes we only have to prepare ourselves, the previous tournament we have been prepared, unfortunately fate has made us a bad turn, sometimes it is the emotions or anguish to hold the title in our hands, hands it has escaped us, it has served us as a lesson for this final and we hope that we no longer arrive in this situation."
Romano now has the opportunity to no longer be a sub-champion technician and taste for the first time the glory offered by the titles.
The European Union changes the rules for obtaining a visa
Individuals must go to Visa Applicants Service Centres prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost of waiting will be reduced.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing visas at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
Under the new procedure, the majority of applicants will be required to report to the Visa Applicants Service Centres (CSA) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
CSA staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have some advantages for aspirants, including the following:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment for an appointment, another payment for processing the visa and another for the mail service to deliver the document.
The aspirant will make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain the same: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa with application (this includes visas for temporary workers) and $390 for a merchant and investor visa.
Those wishing to renew their visa will not be required to attend an interview with the Consular Representative, they will only report to the nearest CSA where they will present the documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Because biometric information will be taken from the CSA, applicants who want a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will stay there less time than before.
Similarly, visa applicants at the Consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra fee of $26.

NASA to announce discovery of alien life
The United States Space Agency has quoted the press to present tomorrow a discovery that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of alien life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference tomorrow Thursday, at 1: 00 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington for experts in astrobiology, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
When it quoted the press, NASA assured that it would present that will have an impact on the search for alien life, "which led to speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures similar to us and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabited and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if its living conditions were improved.
There seems to be talk of a microbe discovered at the bottom of the Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, which lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, because the lake is rich in arsenic.
In any form, the creature uses the arsenic as a way of life and this ability makes us think that a similar life might exist on other planets that do not have our volunteer atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will communicate the true scope of the findings in tomorrow's press conference on Thursday.
At the conference will participate the geobiology Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (Saturn's largest satellite), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of the Earth.
Germe PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón 'bloc' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of "bipartism" is possible, it is denounced.
The 60th had just settled when in the Congress appeared an opposing bloc led by the deputies of PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who declared themselves independent and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of "bipartisan" in the Chambers.
Before initiating the session of the 60-th Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patrón Montalvo, 'thundered' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated, "bipartism" is initiated because now there are two people, of the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputies, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Executive Board, chaired by the PANiste Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of PRI and PAN.
He mentioned that the following days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme on the basis of political will and if they did not, they would again be enslaved by both parties and in this way the opposing coalition would end.
"So far (the opposing coalition) has arrived, that is what I am looking at, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, de Convergencia mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patrón there are coincidences and that is why they form a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of law reform that there is an eternal bipartism in Congress."
To begin with, this group begins with 5 legislators and they are now talking to other colleagues to make them more numerous, the Convergent has abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of PT explained that the Congress has now turned into a 'booty' between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
"Before there was only one party, now they divide it between two."
Patrón Montalvo asked to respect the MP's personality, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"That they do not leave by means of cupulary agreements outside to 5 that will probably be 9 Members, now to the five that we are seen, separated in different fractions, we have decided to unite to seek a place in the negotiating table, that is the problem, that in the reform that they have made, that they have decided, we are outside and we do not agree with that reform."
$200 million more for "the supplier"
The Mazatlán Town Hall pays another check to the questioned owner of the electrical equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 pesos was issued by the City Council to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
With this, the amount paid to the owner of the electrical equipment company in the second half of the year amounts to 1 million 200 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipal, the latter cheque number 9258447 was issued in the past 16 November for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, in concept of "liquidation of account suppliers."
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had said that the Municipality would pay other amounts to this supplier, which was observed by the Superior State Audit to sell at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total debt and, therefore, cheque combes will still be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
"We didn't buy anything, we just pay him what we owe him, like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques "re-appeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29 and October 16.
Even though the supplier has not yet published in the Official Gazette of the State, according to the forecasts of the Act when a company is questioned by ASE, to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used its services again.
All this, after July 25 Noroeste had published a revision of the cheques that the Town Hall issues to its suppliers, revealing that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the triennat of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the Municipality paid Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos, through 42 cheques.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, cashing cheques of more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be treated
The tourist entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad conditions of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a hollow of the roundabout Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in bad conditions and project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Zona Dorada Association of Traders, recalled that they have repeatedly called for the image of the destination to be cured and new activities must replace the others that tourists find bad.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and they see the mess and avoid nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to close a business one day and they don't know the fortune you lose, otherwise they didn't do the work for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance on the part of the Town Hall.
"The municipality will have to shoulder its responsibility and avoid it again, how to do it, therefore through preventive maintenance and only do the corrective," he said.
"We want to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants who deserve a clean place to live there and the Town Hall must change its strategy to maintain the city well."
There are other sites that are neglected and incomplete, he said, such as Escudo and Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it depends only on promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleanliness in its beaches, boulevards, permanent maintenance of tourist attractions," he said.
"They have not been given the attention they need, and this type of fact underlines something that is well known to all, the interview is necessary."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Under Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the recovery of the tourist sites of Mazatlán is urgent, because they are not used properly and project a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that must be put online together with the municipality and be a priority in order to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that should first be ordered, cleaned and put on line to make them attractive so that they can add to the inventory that we have to promote this destination."
IP requests results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront one another.
The business sector of Mazatlán calls for a dignified and free working legislature between the parties and the Government Executive, because Sinaloa is convulsed and faces great problems.
Yesterday we installed the 60-th legislature formed by seven political forces, 19 deputies of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergencia and one of PVEM, in total 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations that the new integrants of the government Congress is a clean and committed management with the society and different sectors that need responsible legislative work and that the same models of party spirit or paternalism do not repeat.
Eduardo Dávalos, president of CCE, proposed that Members assume the great responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations that confront one another.
"We hope that Members will really exercise their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the custom is that they make pacts to safeguard their own interests and they turn into carnival masquerades for the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to build the necessary bridges that the current Governor is making.
"We will ensure that they do a dignified and especially committed job with society and sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotels Association, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to push and add forces seeking the economic growth of the state, because the economic situation is now very complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that in a way will stimulate the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourism activity, he asked that the new legislators give it the importance it has in the government budget to consolidate the Secretariat of Government Tourism.
"I understood that it is the second State Secretariat with a smaller budget and it is incongruous as a major economic activity that generates foreign exchange and investment and that directly competes with the agro-industry."
Apart from classifying resources for detonating tourism projects that help to provide security to the state and updating the Alcohol Act that previous legislatures have not been able to resolve.
We're looking for king mage.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the family Coronado Valenzuela.
For their parents, the next day of the Magi will be difficult to fulfil their illusions, for their home is formed by no more than 12 people and a kid.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will wear the toys and clothing they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house in Colonia Salvador Allende and they live day by day because their father does not have a stable job.
"Sometimes it's very difficult for us, because my husband doesn't have a job, but we sell tangerines and potatoes... and in the afternoon I go out with the plebes for sale on the street," says Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bicycle, and her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
José Alfredo, a 10-year-old, has long aspired to have a 'monster truck' and for his 8-month-old brother Jesús Cayetana suggests a year's worth of clothes.
"He said to me (José Alfredo), 'I would like to have this monster', but I said to him, 'we will see, my son', because he was very expensive," remembers Cayetana with sadness.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
María Guadalupe, 11 years old, heats size 12; Isaías, 10 years old, heats size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, heats size eight.
José Juan, 14 years old, needs a pair of sports shoes, so a pair of the size five and a half or six would help him a lot.
If you want to help make reality the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the On Search King Mage campaign, by giving a toy or money to the reception of Noroeste.
14 suspected drug traffickers arrested
A dozen searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday as part of the dismantling of a cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
Searches were conducted in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places that would have been used for drug production.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and production equipment were seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson for the Sûreté du Québec.
In all, eleven men and three women were arrested, including the two alleged leaders of the network, two Sherbrooke men.
Those arrested were scheduled to appear at the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could face charges of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These searches were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was information received from the public that allowed us to make these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the regional investigation module of the Estrie de la Sûreté du Québec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Régie de police Memphrémagog took part in this police operation.
Illegal migration can continue without problems
The Conservative bill, which, according to the government, should solve the problem of boats carrying illegal migrants, will obviously be defeated while the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely heavily on the Charter."
"I stand with a party that created granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, when he was surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the proposed bill, which would allow for the detention of up to one year any person from a ship identified as carrying illegal immigrants, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Bloc Québécois, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he was targeting the wrong target.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
The NDP's critic of immigration, Olivia Chow, rejected the criticism that her party was not strong enough about illegal immigrants.
"New Democrats agree to take action against smugglers, and that's what we're doing through another bill, the C-35," said Ms. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservative bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for at least a year," said Ms. Chow.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"Canadians tell MPs massively that they do not tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take firm action," Minister Kenney responded.
The government did not announce a vote of confidence on its bill, which could have led the country to elections should it be rejected.
One Conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote so that every Member who opposes would then explain himself to his constituents.
The new unit is not unanimous
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the establishment of a public commission of inquiry on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, maintains that this idea is not a matter of yesterday: Quebec would have consulted with the New York Department of Investigation on this matter as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
Yet Tuesday's announcement surprised more than one.
It must be said that at a meeting of the Permanent Council on Police Services in Quebec on October 29, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
It was no longer necessary for the pequist critic of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement a "rabbit out of a hat" and a "DIY solution on the corner of a table."
Minister Dutil responded to those who feared that political power would have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You're going to see the result when we announce it," he just says. "
"We're aware of that problem."
For the CSQ president, Réjean Parent, there is no substitute for a public inquiry.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, the more people think like you and me that he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the École nationale d'administration publique.
To overcome this impasse, he suggested that Quebec give a special mandate to the Auditor General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We need to be able to expand the Auditor General's mandate," he says.
He also felt that Quebec could give the auditor the same powers as a commissioner, allowing him to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project in the Charest government's boxes.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code in order to be more responsive to this type of crime.
This request would be made by the Prosecutor for Operation Hammer, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that case law is not explicit in such investigations.
Federal Public Safety Minister Vic Toews has confirmed that his Justice colleague, Rob Nicholson, is currently considering some of the amendments related to this issue.
In Operation Spring 2001, which struck groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently passed the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under high surveillance
Several rivers remain under high monitoring due to heavy rainfall that has hit several parts of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another slide reportedly occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudière.
A road has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rainfall fell on several regions, ranging from 40 to 70 millimetres of rain.
An additional 20 to 40 millimeters of rain were expected by Thursday night, depending on the region.
Areas north of the river and in the Ottawa Valley were most affected.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
Because these precipitation must be added to the melting of snow already accumulated in some areas, there is concern that several streams may overflow.
Flood warnings were issued on Wednesday evening by Quebec Civil Safety for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the North, at Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentians, and of the Oak, in Lotbinière, were the subject of flood watches and remained under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused overflows of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was taken away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In the Outaouais region, the overflow of some lakes has resulted in the closure of several roads, notably in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil Security remains on the alert and is monitoring the situation closely, said Annik Bouchard, Security Advisor.
On Wednesday, the Centre de prédiction des floods du Québec issued warnings of heavy floods for several rivers, including Maskinongé, L'Assomption, Ouareau, l'Achigan, Batiscan and du Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Québec radio host Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) for controversial comments on social assistance and Haitians, as well as his coarse language on the air.
The CBSC found that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their views, but that some of the comments contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unduly negative representations of Haitians, and rude language that was not appropriate for programming broadcast during the day."
The Commission also concluded that a discussion on suicide, including the broadcast of the names of two individuals who had committed suicide, did not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CBSC had received several complaints about comments made during programs broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint by the Quebec Joint Front des personnes assistées sociales.
The group complained that the amounts cited in the issue were inaccurate.
Facilitators should provide sound rather than misleading information.
On suicide, host Stéphane Dupont had considered suicide to be a cowardly gesture.
The majority of Committee members concluded that the message was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes in question of" Dupont le midi "addressed a sensitive subject in a fair and appropriate manner."
No reprimand has therefore been held against him.
The last dispute concerned statements that followed the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had then given themselves to a media face-to-face that had elicited a lot of reactions.
The host of CHOI said that he had made no donation to help Haitians because it could not be sure that needy people would really receive the money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension on this."
"My file has been blank for a year and a half," said the host.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the dissemination of coarse language.
In each case, the broadcaster CHOI-FM collaborated "beyond its obligation."
The consequences are minimal for the station, which will, among other things, have to announce these decisions once during prime time within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Montrealer of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely special career.
The athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing climbs the world's tatamis and rings in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts like kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008 to evolve among professionals. "
"In my case, I'm looking for fights everywhere, as for those who don't like the ground playing in mixed martial arts, competitions are rare in North America."
Recently, the one who works as a security officer and clerk for the UPS company has just delivered bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) Amateur World Championship (WKA), October 23-30, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"The fighters who finished in the top four at the last World Championship in each category were invited."
"I won bronze in 2009 in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eighth."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, when I came third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made progress in every competition."
"At this rate, I'll be first this time or next year!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a discipline from China where punches and kicks, as well as ground projections, are allowed.
The duels are originally held on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist from this form of combat is the Vietnamese American Cung Le, well known in the martial arts world.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his career, he will certainly answer his presence at the super King of Sanda tournament, the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explained the nice guy. "
"It's kind of the equivalent of the Stade Lumpinee (Thailand's biggest stadium)."
"It's been a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, in the semifinal of his category (80 kg), before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro," he analysed. "
"There are four fighters per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The semi-final winners compete in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category face each other in order to crown only one champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec awarded $450 million in over-the-counter contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts, a consortium of BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor obtained the most important, that of project management, for a sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tenders.
This consortium, Energy Stewardship, was formed in 2004 in conjunction with Hydro-Québec's decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
In early 2005, the Energy Stewardship consortium won the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, the use of business consortia poses a serious ethical problem that could eliminate competition and lead to higher prices.
"This is the new way to collusion and bring down competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it secretly, now do it openly," said Pequist MP Sylvain Simard at a press conference yesterday.
Earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because he said he found it difficult to see how the public interest could be served in this way.
Natural Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau replied in the afternoon, strongly denying that there had been collusion for this contract.
"I'm starting to have my trip," she weighed, arguing that the PQ had been "dishonest" and "lacking in rigour."
She said that "it would be the least thing" that the PQ apologizes for.
The consortia formula is a common practice around the world.
It is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their respective expertise in order to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project has a high level of complexity given the scale of the work.
The project is in progress and is scheduled to run until 2012.
However, the contract was awarded without competition; there was negotiation.
Also, the consortia formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As revealed last week, Le Devoir, the consortium formula in the consulting engineering sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick overview of the Quebec Business Register allows for the number of more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, including CIMA +, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin and others Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens, brings back to one and the same legal person, Dessau.
With respect to the Energy Stewardship Consortium, Minister Normandeau noted that "the James Bay Territory has been responding to specific labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec has been responding in a particular way since the 1970s."
The great patron of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte of the James Bay Energy Corporation (James Bay Energy Corporation), gave an explanation that made it clear that the project's stewardship contract was granted over the counter.
"If you go to tender and there are few bidders, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: either you take the people who are in this market and you say: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, it is the competence of people," said Mr. Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Consortium Énergie Gérance is part of a long list of contracts over $50,000 obtained by the Parti québécois.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 consulting engineering contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or their subsidiaries, including soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin awarded 22 contracts, Génévar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, not to mention its participation in Energy Stewardship.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449,783,344, including the $295,131,564 contract with Energy Stewardship.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four firms that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known in the Liberal Party of Quebec."
Minister Normandeau dropped the fact that the PQ is also linked to these firms that "finance it," before making it clear that it was rather its leaders.
Responsible Consumption Barometer - Green label does not inspire confidence
Greener, but frankly skeptical.
Quebec consumers have little confidence in sustainable development actors, but also in fair brands and eco-certification to guide their choices.
Even though he is immersed in a media world where messages for more responsible consumption are puzzling, he deplores a lack of credible information, which he even describes as a brake on his commitment, says the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first reading was delivered yesterday.
Although they increased consumption of so-called socially responsible products in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say they do not believe the environmental commitment of companies as well as the green advertising of companies, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatoire de la consommation responsable de l'Université Sherbrooke.
Another finding is that half of the consumers doubt the reliability of the official certifications applied to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands that appear to be eco-responsible, says the Barometer.
In the same vein, politicians' discourse on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be essential to stimulate this segment of current consumer activity by nearly one-third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the emptiness and dubious nature of the information would ease the ardour of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
On the other hand, one third of Quebecers also express concern about the alleged performance of green products or services that are being put in their hands.
On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and above all changed the brand of one or more products to meet their conviction.
At 61 per cent, they also encouraged purchases from local traders and favoured the purchase of food products grown in their area, according to the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the index of responsible consumption reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present itself as the king of recycling who seeks to reduce its environmental footprint by focusing on animal protection.
But his social and ecological consciousness seems to remain outside his car, says the Barometer: in 2010, just 28% of Quebecers reported using public transport or calling for carpooling to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioural survey, which has just taken its first shot.
A State loan for the purchase of eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit financially to the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Société Angus and Parallèle, agrees to collaborate, but only on a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and Parallèle, who hoped for a seven million dollar donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent by giving it its full cinephilique vocation, do not get what they wanted.
The government agrees to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected donation, the Government of Quebec is proposing a loan that would be below the original expectations, which could be a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of sources from state agencies.
A first action plan and a request of $12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
A proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Société de développement des enterprises culturelles (SODEC), François Macerola, who is piloting the eXcentris case.
He sent her a final report about ten days ago.
But the firm's counter-proposal reached SODEC on Tuesday.
The Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to reply.
It seems, however, that the hypothesis of State donation really needs to be ruled out.
It should be recalled that the Association des propriétaires de cinémas et de cinéparcs du Québec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the purchase of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it has not done for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several speakers in the community called for substantial economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the master of céans, has for ten years been holding out the author's cinema in his premises of the complex after having financed his own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is shocking in Montreal, and eXcentris had been able to retain its clientele.
The Angus Society and the Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to push the acquisition wheel.
Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, Le Parallèle, has continued to broadcast films at eXcentris.
The aim of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27 by screening Xavier Beauvois' beautiful film Des hommes et des dieux.
But Christian Yaccarini did not recall Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals that are being made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada...
The new American diplomatic cables disclosed by WikiLeaks cast a veil over what the United States considers the Canadian inferiority complex to the Americans, but at the same time they betray the Americans' sense of superiority over Canada.
For example, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-U.S. relations in mind when going to vote and believe that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government get its budget adopted in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out in the public square yesterday, offer more crisp details than substantial content to put under pressure.
A cable dated September 22, 2008, in the midst of a federal election campaign, tells how the United States is not part of the issues discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins offered some explanations for that situation.
"An almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex may condition Canadian political leaders to talk about everyday domestic issues rather than focus this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to talk about it."
The Ambassador understands all the less this "deafening silence" because the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Logically," he says, "the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to manage this essential relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to vote."
The other expression of this sense of importance is in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, Ottawa-based business officer, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help ensure the government's survival in the federal budget vote in early February, where Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade as a result of a $30-40 billion stimulus package," says Breese.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the drama series broadcast on CBC refers to the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence, and H2O, which have unsubtle references to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the CIA's muzzled interrogations.
Another cable reports that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner replied yes, but on the basis of the "case-by-case" approach.
At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he gave a paper to the Secretary of State about Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, it should be noted that the minds are warming up about the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former advisor very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive flight should be "murdered."
He echoed Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan to renovate lighting
Yesterday in Cancún, the United Nations proposed a plan to renovate domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction that is almost one third of the additional reduction needed to stabilize the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is in line with the major concrete projects that the United Nations hopes to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments by the industrialized countries.
According to yesterday's plan, if incandescent light bulbs that still monopolize 50-70% of the market were replaced by compact fluorescent light bulbs or, better, light emitting diode (LED) light bulbs, most of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHGs emitted on the planet to illuminate humans would be avoided.
Lighting accounts for 8% of global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the global fleet emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that are expected to increase overall GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But we will have to subtract another 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilise by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to avoid it becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy dissipates in the form of heat and the rest, 5%, produces light.
With compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, the energy requirement is reduced by another two times.
The average length of compact fluorescent bulbs is 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as that launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent light bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a replacement plan that would apply to 100 countries.
These brand new bulbs can also work with rheostats in addition to emitting very little heat.
And they don't contain mercury.
A number of specialists have shown reservations about compact fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless manufacturers implement instructions.
But, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the fluocompact bulb, but rather coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would make from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion a year in electricity purchases and 8 million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost it 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire waits in nervousness for the announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the presidential election in Côte d'Ivoire, after the deadline had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results without further delay," said a spokesperson for the UN Head.
"It calls on all Ivorian parties and the institutions to show responsibility and to refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission dropped the deadline of Wednesday midnight without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's election.
About 40 minutes before the deadline had expired, the President of the CIS had stated on television that the Commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Calls have increased on Wednesday in the world for the CIS to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round between the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and the opponent Alassane Ouattara.
But Camp Gbagbo is counting on the Constitutional Council's cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north, held by the former Forces nouvelles (FN) rebellion since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, campaign director of the Ivorian president, said that the attempts by the FN to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from voting.
The entire election could be cancelled if Gbagbo's complaints were upheld by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's opponents believe that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any connection with the ex-rebels, considered the delay in announcing the results "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council, after preventing the election commission from disseminating the results, would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential election, on Sunday, was supposed to culminate in the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country that had been divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations warned the Ivorian political class that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the lead of the first round on 31 October, with 38% of the votes against 32% in Alassane Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate remained stable in France in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France as defined by the International Labour Office (ILO) has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including the overseas departments), show the provisional seasonally adjusted data (CVS) published on Thursday by Insee.
The number of unemployed in metropolitan France is 2.631 million.
Data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3% of the working population in metropolitan France and 9.7% with the French overseas departments.
Over a year, the unemployment rate rose by 0.1 percentage points.
More broadly, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter but wanted to work, whether or not they were available within two weeks to work and whether or not they were looking for a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market deteriorated further, with a further increase in the unemployment rate, to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points over three months, + 0.5 points over one year) and 25% including the overseas departments.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed within the meaning of the ILO.
The elderly experienced a slight increase in unemployment, at 6.4% in metropolitan France (+ 0.2 points over three months and over one year), i.e. 482,000 people aged 50 or over, and 6.6% with the overseas departments.
Only 25-49 years old enjoyed stable unemployment in the third quarter, 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points over three months, + 0.1 points over one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
The Insee no longer publishes monthly unemployment rates since 2006, after a controversy over its method of calculation.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% for France (including the French overseas departments) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini indicted and detained
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, manager of waste treatment companies and brother of President PS of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, was indicted and jailed at the prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence as part of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public procurement.
Alexandre Guérini was indicted for abuse of social property, embezzlement of funds and public property, concealment, active corruption, influence trafficking and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is fighting and wants to explain himself on all the questions that the magistrate will ask him, not fantasies."
"It's easy to sue him for a multitude of reprehensible leaders, it's something else to prove them," said his lawyer, Florence Rault, before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the strong PS man in the department, Jean-Noël Guérini, wanted, through his lawyers, to send the judge a memo before his hearing in order to explain himself.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted on Wednesday night and dismissed.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, his client never did anything but run the landfills he had to handle.
As for the award of contracts or the destination of funds related to their operation, he was never aware of them, Mr. Simon said.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement of public funds and complicity, and left free under judicial supervision with a ban on meeting the protagonists of the case.
"My client was able to provide an explanation of the charges against him."
"The examining magistrate took this into account by not depriving him of his liberty," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons had been indicted and released on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, with two of them being placed under judicial supervision, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karbadjakian, Deputy Director General for Cleanliness of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "trading in influence and passive corruption."
Two officials from Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged with "embezzlement and embezzlement of public property by a person in charge of a public service mission" and "complicity in embezzlement of public funds."
Finally, Alexandre Guérini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with "concealing abuse of social property."
Among the people who faced Mr. Guérini was Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who recently collapsed in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement affecting Corsica.
The investigators suspect that his companies were used to launder money from the great banditry.
The investigation is carried out as part of several judicial information opened against X in April 2009 following anonymous letters, for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
From a source close to the survey, the investigations focus in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne as well as from certain cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss case: Elysée exaggerated Syria's mediation
For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage," held the opinion in breath in France, put diplomacy on alert, and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of the underpinnings of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, even giving them advice on how to deal with their own "hostage" crises in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not been matched by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the American justice system for trafficking in materials for the benefit of Iran's nuclear programme.
Finally, they point to the way in which the French Presidency sought to manipulate the media in order to support the idea that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, that was not the case.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostage cases."
Elysée's advisor for strategic affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make a noise," they say, "keep hammering in the media the words" fundamental human rights, "" innocence, "" immediate release. "
It is necessary in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Do it all the more as the Iranians ask you not to."
For, past attempts to discuss through discrete channels, "silence will not settle anything," the Iranians are "masters in delaying maneuvers."
He added that the arrest of foreigners was "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for political blackmail."
He announced that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she takes refuge at the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large sum of money to Iranians" (230 000 euros of bail).
And he says that Elysée anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will get worse."
Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is being disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is calling for for an illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge.
The American embassy, like many observers, is wondering about this troubling coincidence.
The expansion of Majid Khakavand is bad news for Washington, which is tracking Iranian clandestine networks for the acquisition of equipment for the nuclear programme.
Has France accepted a bargain?
The liberation of the Iranian against the French?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier assured that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he said, not only "was completely taken by surprise by the judge's decision," but sought to oppose it.
"There was a lively exchange between the French Presidency and the guard of seals" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reverse the judicial decision," he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "close" supervision of the French intelligence services.
The advisor of the Elysée calls a telephone number, hangs up, and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy."
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not spare any effort, by means of press releases and "leaks" organized in the media, to suggest that Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad played an "important" and "influential" role as "mediator."
The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the manipulation is bearing fruit, since several press articles pass on the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes "the media 'blitz' of French officials."
On what basis is so much "gratitude" expressed to Mr. Assad, asks the Embassy in Paris.
"Despite their laudable statements, French officials recognize in private that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done."
The paper then looks at the reasons that prompted the Elysée to contribute to this fiction.
The intense communication effort "aims to validate Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyses.
A policy launched in 2008, which "was then perceived by many critical voices in France and abroad as premature and undeserved."
By "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what praise it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran."
The American embassy knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot."
No online games for young Koreans past midnight
The South Korean government will pass a "Cinderella" law that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, said government officials.
A bill will be submitted to Parliament in December to ask online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight, young people under the age of 16, said representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night and then have difficulty studying at school and having a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to guarantee their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at 6: 00 am.
Companies will have a year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government is also considering asking companies to limit the daily access time to these games for young people whose parents request them, said the head.
It will also provide people who request it with free software to limit the amount of time they spend on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report various facts related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online games competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games against 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: the FIFA designates the organizing countries
In full turmoil due to suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee designates Thursday the organizing countries of the World Cups 2018 and 2022, an eminently political choice where the struggles of influence and lobbying risk taking precedence over the technical criteria.
One thing is certain, the 2018 edition of the Queen of the Fifa competition will take place in Europe, traditional bastion of the discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its establishment in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities among the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives a measure of the economic and political stakes of a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes trading is likely to last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy between candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) files have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very burdensome for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, which led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle of football that hosted the World Cup only once in 1966.
The BBC handed over a layer on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that pinpoints three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
What to displease the FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have been engaged in intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron on the front line.
The Head of Government hopes to reissue the successful coup by his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 had won for London the organisation of the Olympic Games-2012.
Will this intense activity be enough to restore England's coat of arms to the EC?
Nothing is less certain because the duo Spain-Portugal is not lacking in assets with its stadiums already ready, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
But the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and doubts about the creditworthiness of Spain and Portugal only increase Russia's rating, which has become a major outsider despite the shortcomings of its record (stadiums, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to make the move to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote," in a barely veiled allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
"We're covering them with mud, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, based on the experience of 1994, appears as the logical favorites.
The world's leading economic power, home of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to be one step ahead of Japan and South Korea, which have built a very beautiful project separately.
But these new applications appear premature for two countries that co-organized the event in 2002.
Another threat is the granting of the Mondial-2026 to China, which was ardently desired by the FIFA, which would in fact render Asian chances for 2022 obsolete.
With Qatar, which has released the big game by offering futuristic stadiums, and Australia, the FIFA would continue its expansion to new countries, but these two countries present more risks than certainty.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also suffer from the low TV fees paid (due to time lag) by European countries, the nerve of the war for the FIFA.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle really hesitated.
Mitterrand made it look like he was hesitant.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than they do.
One warrant at the Elysée calls for another.
So the current head of state will be a candidate in 2012.
But the evidence does not fit well with the share of mystery attached to the presidential office.
Then we have to pretend that there is still doubt.
One way or the other.
In 2006, even without believing in it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that a third term was not excluded.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy assured him that he would make his decision "somewhere in the autumn of 2011."
That he evokes before UMP parliamentarians on Tuesday evening at the Elysée, the prospect of "two terms" has thus sown a little feverish.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
We were a long way off.
The President merely recalled that the 2008 constitutional review limited the number of quinquennium to two.
He was making a statement, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has evoked the presidency, in the tone of humour, at such meetings.
"At worst, or at best, you'll still be seven and a half years with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the next step."
His remarks the day before yesterday did not make him more candidate than the previous day; they did not make him any less.
There are two reasons why they should be commented on.
The acceleration of the running for the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the entry into competition of Ségolène Royal that causes Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is because his candidacy in 2012 is obvious that many in the PS are calling for a battle order earlier than expected.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion at the UMP on this," immediately and cautiously responded to the Prime Minister's entourage.
"If he believes defeat is possible, he will not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who was obviously resigned.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should be an opportunity to clarify the modalities for the exit from the crisis or, at least, to announce the cessation of many of the non-conventional monetary policy operations to be completed at the end of the year.
A crisis of European sovereign debt forces, the Frankfurt Issuing Institute will probably not be able to afford to be so peremptory, lest it aggravates a situation that is more than tense today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be even higher.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French finance minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis in Europe.
It did not wish to say whether it believed that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its sovereign bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my thoughts to my European partners (...)."
The previous day, in Brussels, during his hearing by the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show any further diserr as to his intentions, merely stating that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "was continuing" and that "we will see what we will decide" at this Thursday's meeting.
The only certainty is that the ECB will keep its main policy rate unchanged at 1%, its lowest historical level since May 2009.
In fact, Treasury bond purchases by the ECB doubled last week to almost €1.35 billion.
And, according to the indiscretions of market operators, it made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese securities yesterday.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have purchased €67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt about the expectations of continued purchasing (see page 29).
Nor do economists expect any significant change in course.
While lending operations over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the ECB is still making unlimited liquidity allocations on generous terms and for periods ranging from one week to three months.
Economists now expect this scheme to be extended by a few months.
"I can't imagine it changing its program significantly."
"Otherwise it would be taking the risk of causing further tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, economist at the Commerzbank.
"A progressive release announced in the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal, anticipates.
Oppenheim.
In terms of its intervention in the public debt market, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these bonds in order to animate an unattractive market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must at all costs replace the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the return paid by the most fragile states from escalating," testified a major bond manager yesterday.
If interest rates fly away, states will be all the more embarrassed to reduce their debt, if not stabilize it.
Safeguarding the euro is at that price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is making its back round
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little, yesterday, with the reflux of bond rates at 10 years.
A return to precarious calm.
After a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents said that they had heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and expect a "unpredictable" weekend, which he then denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the gap with the German long rates had reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedging contracts (CDS) had dropped to 263 points, resulting in some distress in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed out that in Spain the gap with German rates was over 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he was "deeply concerned" about "market turbulence" and possible contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that she's like Portugal," says Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly, its problem is the lack of growth and the sluggish tax revenues that go with it, making the state run the risk of being unable to cover its financing needs.
The latest forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected at 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget currently under consideration in the Senate is set at 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the government deficit will still represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared with 3.9% foreseen by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumour of a new budget collective that could be set up after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," says Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The fundamentals of his economy are in order and his accounts are good, we have been repeating it for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF.
"There is no immediate problem, either in the short or the long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), Italy's stabilisation efforts are less than those of other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which early elections could be held at the end of March.
It would then open up a period which is not conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde hammered him again yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I believe, have been shown again on Sunday during the day and at night, are obviously united, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although relative, yesterday's relaxation of the rates of European government bonds has brought water to the governments' and the ECB's mills.
But we cannot yet talk about a start to standardization.
Standard & Poor's has announced that it could degrade Portugal's debt score, the target of speculation today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political visibility, which affects banking systems in particular," says Exane BNP Paribas' economists.
Especially since "political time is much slower than market time."
Aware of this gap and the dangers it presents, the European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis arrangements.
Informal consultations between the finance ministers most directly concerned and, more broadly, with their G20 peers are well under way.
This is also in view of the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the menu, the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the collimator of markets (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, started on Tuesday in Singapore a tour of Asia to inform far-eastern investors about the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground for them.
The first issues of EFSF securities are scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official US representative told Reuters that the US would support a possible increase in funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
The leading countries, Portugal and Spain, are in the process of adopting structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms in addition to austerity measures with closer effects.
Lisbon and Madrid want to take a different path from those of Greece and Ireland.
Both sides are anxious to avoid asking for international assistance before putting in place their own budgetary adjustments and deciding on the structural reforms needed to restore lasting confidence.
Finally, European donors discuss the options available to speed up the process of normalising sovereign bond markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first suggested that if the EUR 750 billion mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to hand over the portfolio.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European sovereign debt market, believe that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism with EUR 60 billion to date.
A council that has every chance of being scrutinized in European capitals.
Especially if market conditions worsened.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange vigilance
Snow events continue to cause traffic problems, particularly on the secondary network in Brittany, and may disrupt certain economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in orange vigilance due to the risk of snow and ice.
The Eure, the Eure-et-Loir, the Deux-Sèvres and the Vienna were added to the 20 departments already in orange vigilance, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, sustained snow showers affect the north of the Gironde and the Charentes and snow on Ile-de-France is weak.
Snow layers ranging from 2 to 5 cm, punctually from 7 to 10 cm, are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, or up to 5 cm, for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are those of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin regions.
Snow episodes are significant enough to cause traffic problems and disrupt certain economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, several départementales were prohibited for heavy goods vehicles of more than 7.5 tons, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
Traffic on the secondary network in Brittany is very difficult according to gendarmes who recommend to take his vehicle only when necessary and the traffic of some TER buses has been suspended for the day.
School transportation was banned for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measures were envisaged on Wednesday evening to restrict the movement of heavy goods vehicles.
The prefecture "invites all motorists to the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving accordingly."
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked the airlines to cancel Thursday 25% of their flights on the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the upcoming snowfall.
DGAC recommends that air passengers contact their company.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in Ile-de-France has been in full swing, the billions have been raining.
In the discussion at least.
In particular, 23 billion are mentioned for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this GSP, the State has announced a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the GSP to borrow a share of the financing of its double loop on the markets.
Today, we finally get to the first additions.
The Amending Finance Act 2010, which was discussed in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the arrangements for finding the start of this money.
There are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase in the tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, we read in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the public establishment Société du Grand Paris."
It is costed: "The revenue from this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a reorganisation of an office tax which already exists "in order to modernise it, to increase its product and to allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris."
How much would that cost?
Mystery.
It's not encrypted in the text.
We're far from four billion.
"It is specified that these tax resources are in addition to the EUR 4 billion in capital that will be mobilised by the State and brought to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," the explanatory memorandum states.
In the GSP, this system is not shocking.
"From the moment we create revenues (the two taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies over three years and then type in the next four billion," we explain. "
"It will be recorded in the budget and drawn as it goes."
The GSP estimates that the $4 billion will start to be entered in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the 4 billion promised are still absent, risks provoking a somewhat agitated parliamentary debate.
First public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers Vengeance and spies in diligence
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals itself as an apparent scandal, a scandal which only appears to be a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes at the international level, and predicts a future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed by order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file made up of a secret service (of any nation) consists exclusively of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only bring back what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those that Berlusconi owns), and Khadafi's sinister caricatural profile had long been for cabaret artists subject to sketch.
The rule that secret records should only be composed of known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in previous books.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do new research (nor does he know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who commit themselves to occultism only believe in what they already know, and who reconfirm what they had already learned.
It's the mechanism of Dan Brown's success.
The same goes for secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or of limited mind) the head of the secret services (otherwise he could be, what do I know, editor at Libération), who only considers as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the American embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same as Newsweek published the week before.
Then why did the revelations on these files make so much noise?
On the one hand, they say what any cultured person already knows, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state could call or take a plane to meet at dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, except for a few small exercises of representation, have turned into espionage centres.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is only out of hypocrisy that one pretends to ignore it.
However, public repetition violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal does not put the victims into crisis as much as the "executioners."
But let's get to the deep nature of what happened.
In the days of Orwell, we could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy had been completely proven since, being able to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway used, and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the avenger of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets hold?
It is true, Georg Simmel already said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secret of secrecy, because it belongs to the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that Hillary Clinton's secrets were empty secrets means taking away all power from him.
WikiLeaks did no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but made it too big for Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, states will no longer be able to put on-line any reserved information - that would be to publish it on a poster glued to the corner of the street.
But it is equally obvious that with current technologies, it is futile to expect to be able to maintain confidential relationships over the telephone.
Nothing easier than to find out if and when a head of state travelled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can private and reserved reports be maintained in the future?
I am well aware that for the time being my forecast is science fiction and is therefore romanesque, but I am obliged to imagine government agents who move discreetly along uncontrollable routes, carrying only messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be stored as a single copy in locked drawers: in the background, the Watergate espionage attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now advancing in crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet restored a wire telegraph (telephone).
The videocassettes (analog) had allowed film researchers to explore a film step by step, going forward and backwards and discovering all the secrets of editing, while now the CDs (digital) only allow us to jump from chapter to chapter, that is, by macroportions.
With high-speed trains, we travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, and the travel it includes, it takes three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, therefore, that the policy and communication techniques should be returned to the horse-drawn cars.
One last comment.
In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies.
Now it is the embassies that ask the press for confidential information.
Climate: how France is fooling its funding promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to look at the implementation of the promises of fast-start and early-stage financing made by developed countries.
And the big French dudes are revealed.
In the Copenhagen agreement, developed countries pledged $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has pledged €7.2 billion over three years and France €1.26 billion (or 420 million per year).
At the opening of COP16, the EU took the big game to persuade its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start financing: report detailing the actions of its member states, press conference, large side event, distribution of brochures...
The transparency exercise is appreciated and appreciated: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right track to meet its €7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But when you look at the details, things are more complicated.
This money must be, according to the Copenhagen agreement, "new and additional," in order to ensure that an additional effort is made without being at the expense of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission had proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that best suits them.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding is maintained, and it is adding $150 million over three years for fast start financing.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the other hand, France considers that the funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional."
In other words, there is no reference to previous years' expenditures or to the overall level of Official Development Assistance.
In concrete terms, France's total support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it claims to respect its commitment to "new and additional" financing...
Another crucial element is the distribution between grants and loans.
Again, there is no rule and everyone chooses their own method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that 1 €loan is equivalent to 1 €.
Of course, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
While the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often emission mitigation projects that rely on more efficient technologies), it is misleading to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... At most, only the cost of the loan to the lending country (equivalent to an interest rate) should be counted against its commitments.
But France has no intention of making such a reasoning: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of grants (36.1 million euros) - see the EU document to check for yourself.
It is the only EU country to use the loan so massively.
Germany requires 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (in other cases) meet their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the vast majority of the European Union puts €1 to meet its commitment, France only puts 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
Nice trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France operates a double scam: on the one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the other on the reality of the financial effort.
By spending only €36.1 million, it can make it appear that it is spending 420 million "new and additional" in line with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it was Bercy who did the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to give if it is enough to lend?) and in the negotiations since the developing countries are not completely fooled...
The early financing chapter is only a small, relatively short-term issue compared to all climate discussions.
But it could be one more grain of sand in the huge machine that is the UNFCCC.
Let us hope that this will not be the case.
In any case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting system for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could advance discussions on the long-term financing issues (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): the question of "additionality" or how loans should be accounted for will not be avoided.
France could change its position to become as progressive on these issues as it is on others.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the discussions.
Alert to child-ingested pesticides
A 10-year-old ingests 81 different chemicals in one day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the group Generations Futures (ex-Movement for the Rights and Respect of Future Generations).
The association, which warns that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in view of the small number of samples analysed, but are illustrative of the problem treated," purchased between July and September the foods usually consumed in four meals and one snack in one day by a 10-year-old child in the supermarkets of Oise and Paris.
These standard meals, including official recommendations - five fresh fruits and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sweets, were examined by laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable carcinogens, and five substances classified as certain carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disrupters (PE), according to studies by several institutions such as the International Centre for Research on Cancer.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each individual chemical are not exceeded, our survey shows that the reality of consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic and / or PE contaminants is of concern," the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than ten possible carcinogenic residues and three proven as certain carcinogens as well as about twenty residues that may disturb the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, as foreseen by the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide which is banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya's green beans, included in lunch, on which the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, chopped steak, canned tuna, and even bread baguette and gum were stuffed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses revealed the presence of nitrate and chloroform.
For dinner, salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues detected, and even the examination of the plastic plate used to heat the microwave meal was not exempt.
The final risk to the consumer of this "contaminant cocktail" is "probably underestimated," according to the study.
The Europe Ecology-The Greens Alliance (EE-LV), for its part, proposed "facing the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides, in order to stop "the increase in the diseases of civilization."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) reported the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, 76 of which were in cereals.
