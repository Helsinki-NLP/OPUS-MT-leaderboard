Called on the world
The market campaign is starting to pull people wide and wide around the world.
"You've got your yarmulke, I need Iceland," said a woman outside in the big world in comments on a market campaign called Looks Like You Need Iceland on YouTube.
Another audience will hold Iceland in her heart forever and a young woman will say she must find her way to Iceland as soon as she lives there.
In any case, it is still in the United States and therefore it is assumed to have to wait for another month.
Another audience asks if the trip to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
You can't follow the story whether it comes from another time zone.
Lgil Thorddarson at Peel's advertisement agency, who came to the production of the advertisements together with the Mcuta Catchi international advertisement agency, says that there's been hopes earlier.
"I came to many inspired by the Iceland campaigns who have walked very well but this new campaign is already beating record.
As a result, it's about creating a PR value, it's getting the foreign media to cover the campaign, and it's gone incredibly well.
Over a relatively short time, we've received coverage of about seven hundred media across the world, which, in total, extends to over a total of two billion people.
The price of this coverage is valued in 1.8 billion crowns.
That's not easy.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has gone very well there, although the Americans are not going to the country for a while.
According to the Egils, known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also received well, such as Russia, which are a comfortable surprise.
In that case, foreign regions, such as India, have occurred which was not specifically suggested.
"These advertisements have travelled beyond our expectations," said Egilla, which may be that over four million people have watched YouTube's material.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The photos here on opening took the Arni Saberg, the photographer of the Morning Press, on the advertisements that have the title "Let Out" in the middle of the last month.
And thekiss were wide and wide, as in the path of the schoolman of Reykjavik, in the passages of the forest, and in the cave of the house of Horhos, and in the cave of Horshath.
The directors were Samuel the son of Bjarki Peter, and Gunnar Paul the son of Olafur, at Scots Production, and who was the taker of Othtar the son of Gunar.
In the roles given were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, which is from Cuba and Hungary.
There were dozens of Icelanders in the production of the advertisements, but at the same time the recordings were conducted in the South, there was another group in the Western and Western countries.
According to Egils, only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign is aimed at a winter campaign in cooperation with MtenocephalC Satchi.
"It's just the first phase of this work for an Icelandic office," says Egilla and helps to cooperate with MARCatchi has done extremely well.
"It's great to work with them.
In projects like this it's important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we're talking to."
Explosion: address the labour market position, pension schemes and many other things.
Ásmundur Einar Döfson Social Minister and Children's Department will be arriving at Sprengisand, starting at 10 p.m. today.
He is also a labour market minister and addressing the labour market as such, the Icelands and more issues.
It also discusss national affairs and transports across countries that have gone poorly and been reviewed over the past few years and decades.
Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, Chairman VR, will also be involved, but he will discuss his criticism in the investments of pensions and provide ideas for labour mobility and employment drivers to draw himself out of the management boards to reduce the risk of conflicting interest.
Then shall Ivar the son of Ingmar, the traveller of the East, and the son of Jóhani, the governor of the State of the North, about the business of travel in the country.
They will continue to see the fall. They will wonder if the success of summer is a deceiver of what should happen.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10:00.
That's how she looks today 25 years later.
Elisa Donovan's actress had a successful career in every kind of adolescent show.
At least she was given a world-famous game that Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
And then she also played in the show Sabrina: The Teenage Witch with Melisa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and in Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has worn her lately, but she had to look over a road and express herself about Clueless on an Australian TV at dawn.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy who died unexpected 2009 and says she's been a great person.
"I have to admit, I built a person the most sensitive thing about girls I met at school who were not nice to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that pervert was," said Donovan about his game in Clueless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after tonight
About 50 cases came to the police' table at the capital region today and said in the police diary that it was diverse.
The day of the police station at the Whoville Station began by the fact that police had to interfere with a man who had just been released from a prison cell after staying there because of a drunk driving.
Didn't want the man to go away after he was let go and didn't listen to the orders of a police officer who told him to go away.
The man's been working on a continued stay at the police station for his career.
Then a man was arrested this morning for a suspected burglary in a company in Copavogi.
Police also had to interfere with two men in Breiðholti due to reports of assault.
Then a woman who was in a mall in Copavogi couldn't pay for the check after a meal and was therefore called to the police.
In addition, we have been reported to drive a car in mid-town this morning.
The driver of the White Renailt looked for her for a while, and she was taken without a hand.
The car hasn't been found yet.
The curse of the Delight Team - the tragic fate of the Glee Star
The theory has taken a flight on the Internet to curse the show series for the Fun Team, while the actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during the days, and therefore became the third leading player in order to give her life long before her age.
The casts of the cast of Glee are a popular series of singing, dancing and joy.
The show was about a so-called band of teenagers in high school, their love and destiny.
It wasn't always taken out with joy to be in the band, but by singing and dancing, characters of the elements seemed to overcome every situation that occurred in their lives.
But outside of the set, there have been a lot of disaster on the players and employees of the show, so that theories have woken up that curse rests on the show.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez to the show, a cheerleader who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the season had slipped, Rivera took her first and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017 Rivera was arrested for home violence against her husband and left them behind.
Dorsey, however, refused to file charges and was dropped in the domestic violence case.
On July 8th, last month, Rivera was reported to be missing after her four-year-old son was found lonely in the lake Pira, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on the boat and he could tell the authorities that he and his mother had stabbed himself in a swimming room and then Rivera would have brought him back to the boat but never returned him there herself.
A huge look for Rivera.
The day after we began looking, the police chief identified the scene of the mission... that we looked out that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was publicly declared dead.
It is believed that it has been exposed to a massive tide in the water and its new last demand to save the son.
Cause of death was recorded in drowning by accidental injury.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angel voice playing a key role in bringing the band to the prevention and respect.
Except for the outside of the components, Moneith, however, was dealing with personal demons.
From 13 years old, he was dealing with addiction and found to be difficult to get away from it.
In 2013, his colleagues found enough of the show, grabbed and encouraged him to seek help.
The montith then went into therapy and seemed to be all looking to the better.
Only two months after the end of the treatment, Montith was found dead in a hotel room after he's been out having fun with friends.
Bananas have been shown to be a fatal combination of drugs and alcohol.
They didn't think there was any willingness.
The duration of treatment and its tolerance to donors had been reduced so much that the previously tolerated dose was fatal.
He was only 31 when he died.
His death lay heavy on his fellow servants, but by the law of his husband, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the taking of the show, and to sanctify them the whole part of the memory of Monith and his person Finn.
Mark Wayne Salling took the part of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the show, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and carried little respect for his fellow cousins in the Delighters, or all until he got the courage to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles suspected of child porn.
At a house house search, he thought there was an enormous amount of child porn, and it soon got out in public.
It was clear that Salling was finished.
He was subsequently accused and convicted of his offense.
Had him over his head a four-to-seven-year-old prison as well as what he'd come to have to be on the list of sex offenders and seek the care of children.
Before the judge had determined the punishment, Salling, who then was freed from bail was released near his home.
Cause of death was suicide.
It wasn't just the actors who fell a long way before age.
Jim Fuller was the director of the show.
He's had an acute sleep attack in 2013, only 41 at age.
The show also won a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was Julia Robert's younger sister, and she didn't have her sister the beautiful story, but she accused Roberts of great control and dishonorable conduct.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she had major depression.
She left a letter to her fiance, where she called her mother and sister, amongst other things, responsible for what happened to her.
"My mother and my so-called siblings get nothing after me except the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She's recently been accused of being along with one of her own men, taking over the location and having star-slapped stars.
Jesse Luken took a guest role in the show in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with drunk driving in 2019, a major scandal.
Heather Morris was playing a big part in the show.
It happened in 2010 that these supersedes came into naked pictures of her and published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benost and Blake Jenner played both the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner was violent in the relationship.
You can put flowers on practically everything
It increases the development of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents growing flowers and get to watch them grow and grow.
It's also endlessly possible to do with flowers like the Swedish photographer, Anna Kubel points to.
Just having a little time with the kids in the park is something that never forgets.
They shall remember the flowers, the scent, and, of course, the precious times they received with their parents.
Bought a boat in the tenth grade.
"I don't think we're many sailors who work at the national playground," Axel says, "Sun Gudmundsson, running beach fishing in the summer, but taking psychia at the University of Iceland over the winter hours."
Coastal fishing is a very comfortable summer job when you're in school.
If you fish well, you can make good money, and I think it's great not to be able to take a student loan.
Also, the relics are good for me in the winter," says Axel Arn Gudmundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist, who's running beach-fishing for the last summer.
Axel was the first to the dock on Tlebjörg when a reporter caught up with him in the morning at the beginning of the week."
"The field I was in the tenth grade, I took the ship's board rights for boats who are under 12 meters long, and I bought my boat summer after I finished the elementary school.
I've been fishing on my boat all summer ago.
I bought the boat used by my friend Hartmann Jonsson, and I called the boat his name.
Hartmann was a grown-up when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, and he was very comfortable when he saw that the boat had his name.
Hartman died a few years after I took the boat, says Axel, and adds to the fact that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, while the other half at the end of summer when I had caught.
So I owed my boat the end of my first summer on it. "
But how could a kid have one and a half million to pay off in a boat when he had just completed the elementary school?
"I had been laying before and gathering money, I had been working with my father to sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my confirmation money in my boat farm.
Axel is born on Ishion, from where all his mother is, but he lived in Copavogi ever since he was a boy.
"I can hunt here in the West Area because I have a home for my grandmother's house on Ísafjörður.
I studied in these areas out west of the row with my dad.
I move in between the distances as I feel, because this hunting area covers all the West.
Even though it's best for me to stay west, I have also fished around the Snæfellese and elsewhere.
I've also hunted south of the South, but it says Axel, who always robs one early morning and says sometimes he talks to a seagull and sings to the sky, in the middle of hours, in a ballist for hours.
"The network at sea is good, so I can call, listen to listening shows and music.
I don't have a problem being on my own.
Of course, I try not to get into danger, but certainly there's been some times, but never much danger," says Axel, who's lucky that he's never sick.
He says the length of the work day will depend on how the hunters are running every time.
"In the coast weather I'm never more than 14 hours at once hunting, but I've also been fishing in other systems, for example in the cabots, but then I've been continuously for one and a half day in a field to hunt."
The arrangement in the beach says he's so that he can catch 770 kilos a day, which he thinks is antagonist.
"The other inhibitions are that I must not hunt Fridays, Saturday and Sundays, and I may only hunt twelve days this month, the four months of beach fishing standing over, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their days for weather and nothing else.
This excessive pressure is to calm people instead of having 48 days across the summer and can choose their own head.
So the regionale could also go because of me and the sea space that are well located at the fishsmiths should enjoy it," said Axel, which draws most abundant thirst from the salts of sea at their beach fishing, but also only quilts and extraordinary types of rivers with.
Axel works in the winter hours of college at the nursery Nation in Copavogi.
"I don't think we're many sailors who work at the country's playground," says Axel proud and adds to that he was only meant to work in the nursery.
"I got stuck there because I think this is an awesome job.
I hope my psych school took advantage of me in the future" says Axel, who's also far away with business studies.
A protocol error preventing host contamination
An error in a registry sheet which people fill when they arrive in the country would cause a person to live on this country, not called back into the shoot.
A social security number is not required if the corresponding form fills in English, as in Icelandic.
"This will be checked for the week," he says, "A specialist at the listening hospital.
Three national transmissions were identified in the National Hospital virus centre yesterday.
One of the positive people came to the country on July 15th, two days after the rules for a condition called "recognition check."
Those who were built in Iceland are then screened for the arrival of the land and returned to take four or five days later.
It was observed in the RUV noon news that the subject had, however, been dependent on the old system.
The sample collection in the border was negative and was not called back to screening for virus.
Kamilla Ruth Sigfusdóttir, a specialist at the CDC, says in a news agency this can be attributed to a bug in the electronic registration sheet.
If people fill out the form in English, they are not required to install a social security number like in the Icelandic version.
In fact, it was thought primarily for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person who did not have an automatic biopsy response.
Kamilla says a lot of people have been followed by the national application rules, although they have filled the login form in English and, in some cases, employers have also been alerted to sending people into sample collections again after they came to the country.
"This will be checked in the week how to facilitate the access of people to draw attention to its process."
The man is in solitary and six have been placed in an incubator.
They all go for a sample, but two of them had started to show off.
There are currently three infected people found yesterday who are mostly completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the Icelandic genetic analysis has demonstrated that there is a variant of the pneumococcal strain identified not previously.
In one of the cases, Israel has been known to carry the virus into the country as well as to other European countries.
Kamilla says there should be a drop tomorrow where the other virus was coming from.
There are now 15 in isolation according to the web COVID.
135 are underincognition.
Four out of five non-infectious infected patients
Five domestic infections have been identified here in the past few days.
Of these, four of them are unplugged, and are not meant to form a source of the infectious virus that came up on the Rey Cup sport tournament yesterday.
There's an infection crisis still standing.
The natives were in the third dozens of exceptional forms of disinfectants, which were reduced to sixteen.
Overall, there are 34 of these new infected people detected yesterday.
This is the second time during short-term exposure to sporting events, and it has been asked whether or not this event should be maintained.
Jón K. Johansson, head of public security, says it's very slow, as long as people follow guidelines and regulations.
"We are constantly balancing for all those who live here that need to retain individual shielding.
We also have some people who are throwing events that there are certain rules going around that need to be followed.
Then you can keep an event," says Johan.
He says that you can prevent infections by maintaining an individual infection protection.
There are also rules and criteria for continuous review.
"What needs to be done, and what the P Safety Department and the National Clinician are continuously edified for people, is to consider the individual infectious protection.
Both at home and then in service companies.
For people to wash their hands and use their alcohol.
This will stop transmission of infectious diseases from going on," says Johan.
"We need to clear people to continue on the good road we were on, so that we can establish the success we have here to grace."
40% of the victims COVID-19 had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult her father was going to catch his breath.
Her father was diabetic and she encouraged him to seek medical attention.
The next day, he was dead.
The death was attributed to sudden respiratory difficulties due to crown-viral infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified as an underlying issue, which is also diabetic, afraid of the one not to go before.
The Reuters press says Brumfield's fear is not a causeless thing.
The number of new studys conducted by the US authorities shows that less than 40% of the patients with diabetes mellitus had 2 below their underlying disease.
When the percentage of subjects who did not reach 65 years of age is examined, the ratio increases to half.
A study of the US CDC comprised more than 10,000 people in 15 states that died from the crown virus during the February period up to May.
Jonathan Wortham, an infectious specialist in CDC, says the results are striking, not much for people diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
A triple increase in Reuter's slow growth was given a survey and points the answers from the 12 states corresponding to comparable proportions.
Ten states, among which are California, and Arizona, and Colombia, are not yet reporting from the underlying diseases.
"Security was already an epidemic of slow stature.
Now, COVID - 19 break through like a powerful wave has named Reuters by Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among black and Latino populations, which have also been less severe from the crown virus.
The best protection for patients with diabetes mellitus 2 is to control the disease by exercise, diet and aid by health care professionals.
However, it has been difficult for many people to keep routine.
Some people will then have used enough insulin to continue coming to work and therefore risk exposure to the virus.
Reuters suggests that the American authorities may have been aware of the risks that those with diabetes 2 may be due to the virus.
When the SARS crowned virus was exceeded in 2003, more than 20% of them had disease and in the swine flu flu pandemic in 2009, this group was at three times higher risk of hospitalization.
When MERS was so observed in 2012, one study demonstrated that 60% of the subjects who died or were committed to intensive care had diabetes.
The Charles S. Dela Cruz scientist at Yale says that because the effects of the COVID-19 virus might no longer have taken away the pandemic from a number of previous complications.
"I fear we will see the flood wave problems when this is over," said Andrew Bolton, the international chairman of the diabetic community.
Physicians have warned that the pandemic virus may indirectly lead to an increase in diabetic complications including kidney disease and dialysis.
As direct new tests to make the crown virus multiply.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the association between the crown virus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, already ill organs in many people with diabetes.
In that case, high levels of glucose and lipids in diabetics can cause a true "cytokinestorm" as called when the immune system responds too strongly and attacks the body.
Damage to endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which may result in fatal blood clots again.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all business."
The story's been corrected.
"We were invited champagne, and then they left the room."
Ásún Magnusdottir and Atli Bollason became an unusual request from the artist Ragnar Gargamelsson to have sex in front of a camera that the artist was putting in Paris.
"We loved each other, so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bollason never forgets when he met his wife and mother of his child, Ásun Magnusdottir, for the first time.
"I was very impressed by her.
It was, of course, the radiation, but it also seemed completely unheard of.
And he's still looking," he says.
Ásbjörn remembers this, too, because he's the first one who's invented it on a regular basis.
"I'm always hearing this story.
Last weekend, she says, who was also attracted to her husband at first impression.
"I felt, and I feel so agitated around Atlas, that I like.
There's a lot going on and so much going on and I'm impressed with it."
Atli says they've been focusing on it in their own relationship to do their own ways.
"We don't tie our babbles to the same knots as the travellers.
We avoided routines that we can tell around us.
There's a possible reason they took this mission from Raggari Kjartan's son, an artist just celebrated, although it was only a few unorthodoxs.
"Our mutual friend Anna will contact us and ask if we can come to dinner with Ethan, Raggis and Ingnar's wife, at Snaps."
Then they offered, and met at Snapps, and took desert wine, and each one of their desserts.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through their plans to a art show he thought to set up in Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
"He had a multi-channel video that was called the Scenes of the hatches.
He described it in a simple way.
Ástrún says he described the work that killed and dekadent sold from the Common Age of Westerners.
"He had the scissies of all the scenes he was going to shoot and last he told us about what he wanted to know if we would be interested in being involved."
The moment Ragnar asked the couple to participate in was supposed to show some young middleclass pairs to make love in a mining room.
"This is sex with beginning and end," said Atli.
The couple knew Ragnar not much though they knew of him, and he of them "but they knew us, and we felt fit in this.
They had a word they didn't want to announce for people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn't get the right people, but people who get sexual news from a performer to someone else.
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we fell out of Snaps we said, "Aren't we just ready for this?
It was just like that.
I trust Mr. Raggari as an artist and his whole team, Ásun and Atli agrees.
"It's about love and the nearness"
The scene was taken up in a nice apartment on Mýr Street.
There was a very small film team, a cameraman, Ragnar, and an artist and a couple.
After the recording, all left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásun.
"We didn't decide anything how to be.
We got some instructions, but we tried to forget about the time and the place.
To be confused about what we were doing and for who.
It wasn't the game, we just loved each other so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrun.
But was that romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," said Atli, and Ásrun agrees with it.
"We were invited for champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was pleased with the performance of the couple in the job that moved them.
"When Tommi the cameraman looked at this, he wept, he thought it was so beautiful," said Atli.
"It's as much about love as it is at hand as its own intercourse," says Ásrun.
The couple's parents have seen the job and they're telling Atli that his mother heard the voice of the Son of the Reykjavik Gallery, and then they realize that he was part of the job.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about it," said Atli.
"Mom and Dad saw this in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then my dad sent me a message, and says, "It's nice to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo," that's why Ásún calls back.
And I wonder if the people in the job had a deeper relationship with Ásún and Attla?
"Well, at least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least it deepens my relationship with the family-in-law, says Ásrun and laughs.
In Copenhagen, Ásun saw its work with its own coal.
"I felt a bit difficult not to be with you but to someone else," she says and turns to the husband.
"But it was nice to see this, because this is just one point in a great deal more work, and when you saw this with the other acts, it's very cool.
I could get a little bit out of it, and I was just proud.
And there was that little bean in my stomach" says Ásruna, who was pregnant with one of the babies when the scene was taken up.
"It was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clausten spoke to Ásún and Atlas in Love History on Channel 1.
Swansea, victory in the previous semi-final game.
Swansea won a 1 0 win on Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the past game of the teams in the semi-finals of getting to the English Top League.
The game was conducted at the Swansea Homegrounds in Wales.
Halftime it was 0-0.
Homemen in Swansea got hell at 64 minutes, while Andre Ayew let down the bow list of the restaurant and protected himself.
Only two minutes later, Rico Henry, quarterback Brentford, the red card.
Brentford played the rest of your game less and at the 82nd, new players of Swansea have been able to help themselves.
And Andre Ayew put them up with the catcase by challenging a great goal and loyalty to Swansea 1-0 win.
Swansea therefore leads to a 1-0 at the duel, but the second game takes place on Wednesday at Brentford's home.
Ministerless for five years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the American ambassador in Iceland, is in the throwing light of the press after CBS reported it this morning that he wanted an armed guard in which he feared his life.
However, the President of the United States of America has not suffered painlessly to appoint ambassadors in this country.
Since Carol Van Voorst has left the office of the ambassador of the United States at April 2009, all has been ambassadorless in the country for 62 months, over five years.
Mr. Van Voorst has left an office in a peculiar situation, but Castlight reported by 2009 that she should have gotten the falcon word.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland... she received a call from the Oval Office... that she wouldn't be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international exchanges at Army War College.
Sixteen months passed until Van Voorst's follow-up in September 2010.
It may, in some respect, be attributed to the fact that Robert S. Connan was ordered as an ambassador, but then she canceled.
At last the job, Loius Ariga had been working in the foreign office for a decade.
He retired in the fall of 2013, and took over the office of an ambassador in Guatemala.
Then another ambassadorless season took place.
Robert Barber has agreed to the United States of January 2015 and came to work shortly afterwards, but no ambassador had been there for 13 months.
Barber was a political man, but not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and a short voter for Barack Obama.
He retired as soon as Donald Trump received the Presidency, January 2017, as usual with a political appointed ambassador.
Trump's administration took an unusually long time to appoint both ambassadors and high-level official officials in the Washington government system.
Therefore, two years ago, until the United States Congress called Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to ask him about his brain and confirm it as the end of the ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony he said he never came to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who was dead, had been of Dutch berries.
Gunter is a political order, used to be a dermatologist in California and has been most prominent in the Republican Party of Repian Jewish Coalicion.
The casino owner, Selern Adelson, started them as a organization, but Adelson, he's an enthusiastic member of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to work in Iceland in May 2019, at which time no ambassador had been in the country from early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest thing in the region.
The reason for both how long Trump's administration was to nominate people in a key office as well as that in recent years the United States has worked very long, including proof of the ambassador to office.
Since 2009, ambassadorship in Iceland for over five years has thus been combined.
However, it has not prevented operation on the roads of the embassy that recently opened a base at Engrated.
The activities are considered to have cost about 6.5 billion... but the walls of security are divided by the building... and shell glass is contained in all windows.
But it doesn't seem to have enough to fill up the current ambassador for security because he's said he's afraid of his life and has requested an armed guard.
IBV former player became racism in Iceland-- "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, former player IBV, claims he's been involved when he was in Iceland and he's sorry he came to America.
This is seen during an interview with Tonny who appears on the ukgant medium, Daily Monitor.
Tonny just joined the Uganda Police FC team who plays in Uganda's top league.
During the interview with Daily Monist talks about Tonny about a lot, including his time in this country, but he played with IBV, Val, and Development in Iceland.
"When I came to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle as I used to play.
The team's captain was in that position, but, besides, he also had the trolley number I wanted, so I didn't get either of what I wanted, says Tonny, but he played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Amongst Tonny's questions, there's a rapportion that he's experienced in Iceland.
He says it's a problem that many black players get hit when they play in Europe.
"This happened once for me, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later I heard about the case, and then I asked my friend what was all about.
He told me then that my opponent had let some racist remarks fall down on me after I tackled him.
In 2014, Tonny left Iceland to Norway, where he joined Haugeunda.
That's where he says he made the mistakes he sees the most of his life.
Tonny had failed to get himself to the starting team at Haugeunda, but he wanted to play more to get to the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined with Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on a loan.
I think if I'd been in Norway longer, I'd have got the chance I want," says Tonny, but he was hoping that if he was going to play well in Norway, he'd probably get more.
He's saying that the loan to Iceland has taken over his dreams of making it into a major Europe team.
Found a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch black worm in the neck gland of a woman looking for it.
Doctors managed to pull out the worm with tweezers.
A study showed that parasites were present.
CNN will explain.
The woman had a few days before eating sashimi, which are thin meat poisons.
The woman quickly recovered after removal of the worm, but parasites such as these are often in raw meat or fish.
After sushi drove to bed in the West, there have been cases of parasites in people, there have been multiple reports of CNN.
Fear of another wave starting in Europe
Spain is now involved with the concern of another crowning virus in Europe, where control measures to restore the spread of the king's pandemic have been taken.
At Catalonia, all entertainment lives have been set on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona with increasing levels of infection.
In addition, other European countries have taken action on cross- infection in Spain, while in the UK all countries have to apply for their return in Spain, like in Norway, and France have been protected by travel to Spain.
It is also increasing the number of infections in France and Germany, where the government is attempting to identify the balance of the virus and to restore the economy.
However, the global situation in Europe is good compared to other parts of the world, but the global incidence of global transmission is close to 300 thousand per day, where most of which are considered to be infectious in America and South Asia.
Confirmed infection has become 16 million worldwide, according to the index of John Hopkins University, and is confirmed to be related to the virus 644 thousands.
I'll finally enjoy the act of Mosicans.
In front of the Toll House of Reykjavik, there's a big deep hole.
On top of it, men with orange helmets.
There's a big grave, too.
And more of my machinery.
The street is closed for traffic.
But the pavement is able, and now many have stopped and respected the work of millions of micosias, as though they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least don't respect it.
The work so far has been somewhat hidden, right in front of it, there were parking places that were always around.
People parked there, locked the car in the fastest car, and then jumped to do their business in the downtown.
"Livable and diverse public space" and "moved citizen" are guided by the remake of the City Road at this time.
The goal is to take care of the area, allowing the daughter of Helga to have a better look at the Tolli.
Until the job becomes a square, where the sun goes well, it's considered a good place for us to stay as roadside areas.
The artwork will be described and now the subject will benefit from these 142 square metres.
In the region there will also be small "douches" some kind of water-tube, which offer up a game and give the area a certain mystery.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjavík, which is currently being done with intelligence.
They're reinventing the water grid, thermal fields, thermal power grid.
Many of them have come to their years, but the sewage and cold water legislation are from 1925, and therefore have served residents and companies in downtown for nearly a century.
Once the hole is opened again at the end of the job, a car can drive around it again.
But it will, however, become one-way street and at the same time, create a calm and accessible dagger for a walking.
The Toll House on the Customer's website said the house was being used in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldorsson.
Because the docks reached through the house, there was a 250-foot windowless wall surface to the street.
The building committee and architects agreed that such a flat would have a bad impact on the overall picture, if not certain measures were taken to trite the appearance of the house.
A party therefore agreed to have a permanent work of art set up there.
In this time a great word went out of the sons of Helga, an artist, and said in the sum of the sum.
She'd been working on a lot of mascist paintings in Germany and beyond.
It was concluded to contact her first, before deciding whether or not a competition would exist for the job.
Often it had been discussed that the work had to reflect life at the dock, for the port had been the life of Reykjavík since she was made.
When she was interviewed with the artist, she had to trample in that kind of work.
It was agreed that she would get some drawings and other help before she left the country, as she would work with the motions abroad.
She got the time she decided herself needed, and when she returned home she suggested some suggestions to discuss.
It was agreed immediately to ask her to do the job.
They also wanted a full contract with her and the famous art firm in Germany, the brothers of Oidtmann, who had worked for a long time with the fact that the production of famous arts across Europe had been developed.
The deal took place, and made the work of the work for the store at the shop of the brothers, who then took care of the production of the Toll House.
All the work was worked exceedingly well done, both of the sons of Helg daughter and of the brethren of Oidtmann, saith in the sum of the sum.
Ever since then, there's an indiscretion of the Icelandic weather.
It took about two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tollhouse job was finished, only 47 years old.
Preparing to export more institutions to land
Ásmundur Einar Dindason of Social Ministers offers that more public institutions will be exported to a land in the near future.
That's what Minister of the United States said at noon on the 14th Avenue.
It was recently reported that the Meritic Sea and Engineer Institutes will be shipped north to the South High School in the fall.
Six specialists in the burn field at the Agency's work, but none of them intend to follow the North Institute, and have the network of fire and sicker's insurgent transport.
"I think we should step further into this creature.
I'm preparing for further steps to this creature.
A further transport, said Ásmundur.
If he is convinced that a great majority of the nation wants to see more distribution of public institutions across the country.
"I think it has to take further political decisions on the transport of public officials to land, as I was doing with the Executor and Engineer Agency," said Ásmundur, who also took examples of other organizations who have been exported to the country and were very important for companionship in the country, such as Selfos's transport agency, Iceland's Land Analysis for Akraness and Professional insurances on the United States.
All the first from the second day of the Championship
In Iceland, Iceland's 94th World Champion of Freetime ended at Thors Airport in Akureyri today.
A couple of protests were made on the second day.
An exciting race was calculated in the women's sledgehammer in Thorsfund, while Vigdís Jónsóttir from FH put Iceland's Barfloft in 2014, standing until Elizabeth Rúnar's daughter from IR improved in May last year.
Vigsdís won the Iceland record back in the summer and she's been in a fantasy during a late episode, but she's tripled Iceland the sum of summers.
Elizabeth has been dealing with injuries and has failed to recover today.
She had only one valid pitch of five, threw 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigds threw the longest of them all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt, and set the same way.
Her Icelandic record she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters, so she was quite anything from it.
IR had the second best attack of the day, but she improved her best results with a fit of 50.18 meters.
In a breed of men, the FH-mann Hilmar Jónsson, the Icelandic champion, a safe victory but he threw 73.84 yards in his second attack and put the anti-sembert.
His Icelandic record on the article is 75.26 meters.
Good Lord Valur Gunason, Olympics and Iceland record holder won a pinball shoot last night at Thors Airport, but today he raced in a round pitch that is his leading story.
Iceland's record is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 yards today and secured victory.
Walters Hjalti Erendsson threw his second hit today, but he had a single strike that worked for the second place, 49.43 meters.
Mershes Sigððirdotir, the Icelandic champion of long-lost, won the long jump contest with superiors, but Oceanes jumped at least 6.25 yards today, which is less than 40 cm from her Iceland record.
In women's 200-yard race, it was IR Guðlína Bjarnadóttir who was the fastest who came in the goal in 24.04 seconds, while her Iceland record in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Jónia was a triumphant man in Akureyri, but she won two gold prizes last night, 100 yards of race, and in 4 x 100 yards, and then also in 4 x 400 yards bid runs today.
In the male class, Sir Kolbeinn the Gunnar son of FH was first at the target of 200 meters in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before the Oulven Moon Samuel's son of Aarman.
Like Guðljóna, Sir Francis won gold in 100 meters yesterday as well as his 400-yard race.
Can't get a fine for a 27 million kronona Bitcoin harvest
The head of the committee has refused the demand of a taxpayer requiring a ticket to a man for the indiscretion of their capital benefits made due to the sale of the mutant Bitcoin.
The committee finds out that the taxpayer would not have made any clear reason why it would be necessary to fine the man.
The Committee's decision states that the taxpayer believed that he had a condition of unrecognised tax returns in the 2016 and 2017 income years.
He would have underestimated his finances that would be due to a sale of Bitcoin's electron up to 27 million, either intentionally, or by some incredible negligence.
Finest man for his conduct.
The man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
At least he was able to deal with it in 2016 selling electron for 27 million.
It would have had him buried in the rivers of 2009 and 2010 when both of them would have been easy and undoor with a normal home computer.
And then he pointed out that when he sold his electric coins, taxed for that kind of sale was clearly vague and unpredictable.
It would have been expected that citizens could be aware of such measures on tax returns.
He wouldn't have meant to get past paying taxes from his crops and would have realized his property for the terms of the currency account.
He would've checked both the wise men and the governor about how it would be done, but it wouldn't work.
Then he thought he needed to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here a few years when he began to dig for Bitcoin.
So he would have been in worse position than anyone else to introduce himself to a complex rules that the tax authority wouldn't have made himself a clear opinion.
The man thought it right that his taxes for these two income years would be re-applied and pressured, but otherwise it wouldn't be executed.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He should never have got out of his duty in an unfortunate way.
The claim of guilt would be of all sorts, and it would be cast into debt.
A balm stirs up the talk, "This man understands what a football is."
Andersen Willumsson's butler has been a big fan of the teeth on people, but he also is entangled by his attitude of the season with Brenubik, the Pepsi Max League.
There will be bodies in the line of fire tonight when they receive IA live on Channel 2 Sport.
A butler takes them out because of four reminders in the season and doesn't show up with a new haircut, like in the summer games so far.
He had had had "bla, blah, blah" written on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know which exact he was answering with the payment, but speaking of character then this one was rather trying in the game.
He didn't go hiding.
He wants the ball every time, and if there was anyone going to equal this game, I thought he would do it or make it," said Gudmundur Benedictsson in the Pepsi Max box, when thought it was Brynjälf.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It's hard sometimes to realize what position he is.
He looks a little out on the left side when it starts to pass, but he's got a very free loop on the team," said the Hjörvar Haffirson.
Þrgell Moonnsson says Bryntilíf is a real entertainer and rejoices in getting such a colourful man in the department: "There is no one who shares this is character.
This is a fun type, and I love this with the hair, and being ready to show up and answer in interviews.
There's an extraordinary lot of people picked up by him, telling me that this man understands what football is.
"I'm an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people, and I like it."
People are reading the interviews at Bryntil, people are paying their way in and watching what's next on his hair.
This man is just a genius," said Moon.
Player KR says he wants to leave the club - "I've been in touch with a few teams in BC"
Tobias Thomsen, director KR of Pepsi Max Division, seems to be leaving the team.
According to the dance medium Bold Tobias is ready to go back to Danmerkur.
Football. Network also identified the case.
Tobias wants to make the beginning of the homeland period, but in order to do that, he first needs to reveal his contract at KR where the dance department starts before this Icelandic event.
The partner knows I miss Denmark and I've had a lot of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I've been in touch with a few teams in the B department and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay up my contract with KR.
Then he says that he probably needs to pay off in Denmark.
"Wonderhood in Denmark has probably found more economic impact on the virus than in Iceland."
Bjartmur's bike recovery for millions has now responded according to DV coverage
For over a year, Birtmar Eliza has had a hobby like most others.
He sniffs up and saves lost and stolen bikes, electric bikes and washers.
Has Birmar mentioned the name "wheeler" in turn.
Last night there was a big fuss when you published a story of their communications with Birmar.
Then tell D.V. at the West Village Facebook group where it turns out that Birtmar took the man on the East Airport and said the wallet may be stolen.
It was impossible to read from the original electrician's original writing, but Bjartmar's been stealing it.
The text has now been changed on Facebook and should be updated accordingly.
Bjartmar tells the original news about the case at all not speculating for what really went on last night in the Orient.
Bjartimar said he got information from the victim of electric music that it certainly was his electrician.
The information received an alleged owner from another, but the information proved wrong, says Bjartmar.
"I saw the guy and I knew the shuttle, "and with information that there was an electric child who had been missing very long and was looking for.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him get ready to drive the shuttle, I decided to punch the man.
The owner was sure of it, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I'm very fancy at this sort of thing, but before I managed to finish what I had to say the man had taken away my word."
But Bjartmar says that the man on the electric machine has immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and himself called to the police.
"Yeah, cool," said Bjartmar, "Let's just get this straight."
And then the owner of the electrician began to prove that they had to possess it on their electric gland and start driving.
Later, the right owner of the electrician told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous story.
In this more than a year of his life that Birmar has visited, he claims to be able to count the times he met with people on one hand.
"I've had peaceful dealings with the toughest men of Reykjavík," said Bjartims, suggesting that bicycle thieves are the longest brothers and sisters of society, addicts, bandits and other people who are, for some reason, on the street.
"The story is hard master, and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately, stealing on such cash is an easy way to reach that goal," says Birmar.
"My business with these people is really so good that I've come with many of the good people to help me.
Some people have been treated and then went to see me and helped me with what I'm doing, he says.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with bikers is on common ground.
Some people know about him and what he's doing and offer him peacefully to show him receipts, tractor numbers and so on.
A bicycle thief is a very small problem.
Furthermore, Bjartmar tells me that the police are even telling people to talk to him about stolen bicycles.
Bjartm is dissatisfaction with the previous DV news and says that he's not some sort of self-employed police in a personal search for justice.
Asking if he's not at least at the bottom of the ice with his action, and whether this isn't the main part of the police, it says Bjartmar so certainly is.
"Of course the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact of the matter is that the cops are probably not doing it.
I have to film and watch police drive away from a big pile of stolen wheels.
She's straight-mouthed in these matters.
"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and the experience has shown me that I can succeed in this language, then why not?" asked Birmar.
He says that he was so successful in finding up on his stolen wheels, that sometimes he would run across his "chores" on the street that they only had the Bjartmari wheel they'd been able to reach.
The exchange Bjartmar has called for police assistance has occurred to the police that it has simply not arrived.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not the owners of the bikes to blame," said Bjartm, and it's sorry that the biker has to suffer empty police in this language.
Bjartmar's success is not divided.
You can find stories of people thanks to Bjartmari for being able to get their goods back to them.
By himself, Bjartmar says long have lost the number of bicycles he's returned, but I'm sure the heights are in millions, if not millions.
There's a road full of electrics, an electric bikes and electric farts, but an electric bike can cost up to half a million.
Birmar is working in a nursery, and every other weekend he works in a country.
So his bike search is unpaid work he does in his spare time.
Pension and long shadows
In 2019, there was a big birthday year in the history of a pension store in Iceland.
Officials had received a pension from Dana kings all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919, all government officials were founded on a pension fund that ended up in the pension of all public workers.
The basis for the current pension schemes of public paymen was then laid with the global labour market agreements in 1969 which were set up on a job-related pension scheme by duty and a full fund collection from 1970s.
In 1974 a law was then set on the basis of these contracts and the pension system continued to improve thereafter.
The payroll's pension system was not the only radical change that worked for the 20th century was driven by its circus movement.
Unemployment insurance was similar in 1955 historical strike initiatives, as well as the organisation developed its requirements for sick rights and medical services, major holiday rights, short duration of work, housing reform and more important.
All these rights cost a lot of hard and hard fight, but they were found to think, much larger and more permanent, but the increase of money in the pay fight, which disappeared just as hard in the colds of the inflation as the isolated season after the war and up to 1990 as many people remember.
In 1969, the addition to the establishment of a general pension programme was both long and complex.
Although men finally found out that the funds in an experienced fundmate had the workmanship to agree that their management should be appointed representatives of the jobseekers and fundmates to match them.
In the coming years after the Agency funds, the majority of the workers in the management boards often reported in the labour organisations, but they never got up to walk, so we're still stuck with the abnormal arrangements that the fundmate representatives are not in the majority of the management boards of the funds.
Section 36 of Article 129/1997 on the mandatory insurance policy of pensions and the operation of pensions is discussed on fund investment policy.
It says the 1st party that "Presidents' must have the fundmate's interests as a guide."
The fifth term also says, "Presidents are to be adopted under moral standards in investments. "
The stakeholders' policy for trade shall include the following provisions, followed by the above legal recommendations:
The PRI is responsible for investments, as well as many of the largest pensions and trade capitals in the West Sea and Europe.
The rules include how the emphasis on environmental and social issues as well as the good management of enterprises can contribute to the improved investment in the Member States's libraries.
This is how interest investors meet the objective of the national community in a broader context.
LV thinks it's important that society, especially those registered in the stock market, aims to make a public policy: that good management of social responsibility and environment practices.
The Pension Fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set up a "sponsorable investment policy" and there are similar provisions.
It's all recalled here as an entrance to the latest Icelandic fashion term, "sustain control."
Since the word is new, there is no hope that it has been defined as sound, but to me, the following definition is now "highest taken": Shadow management is when a union leader says that he's going to send the representatives of the company into the Pension Board or instructions on how to take a position in particular cases.
If they don't follow their instructions, they'll be relieved of their command in the first practical event.
If the lead man doesn't take it to the press and he doesn't talk about information, it doesn't mean "having control" are that kind of talk between people, of course, always in the financial world, like somewhere else.
I'm gonna let the reader think about which way he likes "faggler."
It is mainly two men who have tried to shape this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, on the 25th of July 2020.
They're tough Ægisson, journalist on the news sheet, and Ásgeir Jonsson of the Devil's Bank.
The purpose of both was after the Bogils Boglason president of the Icelands had told their intention to break the contracts with flight attendants and flight attendants (sell them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, the head of the traders of the Reykjavík, they would be sent out to the company's representatives of the Secret Service Commission to support the lack of the possible funds of the stocks in the club, so they might be allowed to leave.
At some point, Bogi Nil pulled his decision back, followed by Ragnar Thord, on the same course by his objections, which, of course, met at Bogga's decision.
Nevertheless, they saw hard and Awesgeir for a reason to talk about it in the newspaper with great words of contrast control, law violations, and a rich need for changes in the law.
It was a small thing that you really should roll a heavy mass even though you had been blessed with a subjunctive mechanism and you were completely wiped out.
Since it's important, let's take care of the matter itself at the end.
I traced here before the scene of the Pension Code Act which is responsible for this matter.
This means that fund management is responsible for funding partners, and they have moral standards for investments, and these things are developed more closely in the approved both interest and pension schemes as I mentioned.
Pensions, however, are NOT meant to look into their investments only for short-term use.
It would be a very dangerous policy, and it would be too long to judge in the past, where large banks and boiling have slipped away for moral adventures and economies, with tragic consequences.
The Director of Icelands was clearly in the middle of ice when he thought to wipe out a whole group of employees, thus seriously reducing the kindness of the company using the European market and its weak position towards investors.
Fortunately, he saw himself and pulled it back.
The time will tell you if it will be enough to make the company's pension investment guarantees to fund companies when they stand up.

One of the people in the disease did not carry a home infection.
One of the three people who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic State on July 15th last year, about one and a half weeks ago.
He's an Icelander who's not localized here, so he didn't have clear instructions to do such a recallable mystery after coming to the country and to take another sample a few days after arrival.
He was negative at the border.
"But he's in Icelandic society, and in fact he's supposed to go into it." "Kamailla Joespsdottir, Specialist at the National Prevention Centre, "and the manager of the CDC while he's on vacation, in a conversation with the press today."
"He used the English registration form, and it's not mandatory to record the social security numbers, and if it isn't recorded, then you're not automatically referred to in the second view."
She says the man could have used the English registration form because he's actually living abroad, but because of his connections on the land he should have used it in Iceland.
At least he hasn't figured it out.
"When the ID isn't registered, you need to apply yourself to the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that it was the right way," said Camilla.
"So it is clear that we need to promote information about this while we find some way to make an automatic signaling system although Icelanders do not record their social security numbers.
Or to make it more obvious who are enrolled in an Icelandic community in the registration system, it explains.
Fortunately, the subject is particularly absent on arrival in the country, although he is defined as a member of Icelandic society, a member of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to a qualifier after being detected yesterday, and these six were all in contact with him.
They're going to go for a sample, but two of them are already showing the signs of Covid-19 infections.
The man was negative at the 15th of July border.
Kamilla says he was recently infected with the virus that she was not yet able to be detected when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not wish to exclude the fact that the man has been infected here in Iceland and did not carry the virus with her to the country.
"It isn't quite possible to say that this is definitely imported because it's a long time since he came to the country that he might have been exposed here like these two who have caused a little rush in connection with the sports interface."
That's what she says, although it's very unlikely that a man is so ignorant of himself here.
"It's really very unlikely," says Kamilla but stated that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has analysed the virus in man.
"If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost safe that he carried it to the country."
Peppersprey and bombs used against protesters.
A raid was made between the police and protesters in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper spray protesters and non-friendly grenades, but protesters broke windows and set fire.
45 protesters were arrested and 21 police officers injured.
Police brutality and racial prejudices were protested across the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were for support of protesters in Portland, Oregon State.
In Austin, in the state of Texas, one protesting bullet was killed.
As evidenced by the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people came together at a peaceful protest.
A group of people set fire in a construction area, and broke windows in the city court.
Then the police said the protesting was unacceptable and the conflicts between the protesters and the police groups.
Demand justice in Aurora, Colorado, Eliah McClain, a 23-year-old black man killed by a police officer last year, at least by protesters.
A car crashed through a group of protesters in the city, but nothing was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of the U.S. Marshals gathered themselves together and sought justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman murdered by a police officer in their home in March last March.
The group carried firearms and joined groups at the closed end of the road where police were related to the group of subjects protesting the protesters and also carrying firearms.
Then there were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters remembered James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man killed by a white bartender in May.
Solar: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskjólar, master of Manchester United, does not want to overreact the importance of the game with Leicester today in the final tour of the English quality team.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea doesn't lose against Wolves, then Soljlum and his men in the fifth place and misses there by the Master's Sea.
At least they'd still have hope to get to the Masters' League by winning the European League next month.
"We're not at the end.
If we can get a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad time," said Solar.
"But whatever happens, this isn't the end of our journey because we still have a lot to go to land by getting the two joints above us" said Solari.
It is clear that the nerves of men get swollen today at 15 hours, but Solsjólla tried to act like each other's game.
"If you want to be Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
This is nothing new, and this is what the company builds.
We've made a great opportunity to end this period well, and now it's our turn to use it."
"This isn't the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anybody who's playing football, the next game is always the most important.
The finals do not define our season, we have already had many hours to define this period."
"Come Bruno Fernandes changed a great deal for us and I believe that we're in better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last season" said Solar.
65,000 infections per 24 hours
65,490 new crown virus infection was detected in the US yesterday according to John Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178.021 West Sea infections have been confirmed since the beginning of the pandemic in these countries.
There were 900 deaths due to the virus yesterday, but the last four days up to the end of which the virus died due to more than 1,000 per day.
A total of 1446,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
There are reports from CNN that, based on the predictor model of the United States prevention, the number of deaths caused by the virus will be 175,000 August 15th of the second.
Fear of other outbreaks
The government of Spain is now attempting to retain an increased spread of COVID - 19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVID - 19, both Thursday and Friday.
Since early May, no more reports have been detected in 24 hours, and they begin to lift up one of the most strict curfews in Europe.
The relapse led the British authorities to now duty a passenger coming from Spain to apply for their return.
A week before, Spain was on the British list of secure lands.
The situation is the worst thing in Catalonia in the Northeast region of Spain where the government has taken over to the broader limits to try to control the stages of growth.
The capital of Barcelona will be shut down in the next two weeks and the cabins will be closed at midnight.
Then curfew is in effect for 200 thousand people in Segria County in the West District of Catalina.
It is believed that the decision of the British will negatively affect the Spanish economy, which is much relying on foreign tourist arrival and is inconsistent after the outbreak.
Tui, the largest travel agency in the UK, cleared all the flights scheduled for today to go to Spain and the Canaanites.
The global government is told to prepare under the late wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in retake back to a massive curfew that has destroyed the global economy.
In order to photograph, Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister of the British, has taken very ill in such a way as a nuclear weapon that he doesn't want to use.
Then Jean Castex, the prime minister of France, has said that the nation "would not survive, economic or socialally" will be executed for national curfew.
Many advisers hope that local resources, which can reach the population of individual towns, cities or regions will be sufficient to restore virus to the next pass if it occurs.
Five new infestations in Iceland - three domestics
Three domestic transmissions were identified yesterday, plus two more at the border.
Five subjects with positive Covid-19 infections were found yesterday in Iceland.
In a public report, one of the transmissible transmissions has been associated with the transmission reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He's been sent to solitary confinement and 16 close associations with him in an incontinent state.
This infected member was a member of a social sport team in Reykjavík, and is according to the announcement, "Only part of the sports team" in an enrichment.
Others sent in an agent are connected to the man in another way.
The source of this transmission is not found, and full transmission by U.S. Marshal's infectious team remains ongoing.
ReyCUP's opponents have followed the recommendations and regulations of the CDC and the current public security and have taken the appropriate measures.
However, yesterday's photos of the tournament drew attention to a very close association to celebrate their good success in the field.
Just before 11 p.m. today, protesting the following notices on their Facebook page.
It says, "TTH: Parents please respect the rules that the contestants are picking up their own stuff at school.
Parents are NOT allowed to do that.
Thank you for your show understanding.
A second transmission was detected yesterday, but associated with the reported transmission last day.
She says in the announcement, "Italic genetic analysis has encoded the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been identified here before."
In this case, transmission can also be obtained, which is infected in isolation, and 12 in stores due to the transmission of infectious diseases.
The third transmission is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was detected in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in isolation, and six people close together with him in an incontinent state.
Two of them already exhibiting signs of viral infection.
In addition, two subjects at the border were identified and waiting for further studies, such as cross-border transboundal work.
Finally, the announcement states that the Federal Police Department and the office of the surgeons should exercise caution and take into account individual protection.
If there is at least a doubt about whether there is any symptoms of the Covid-19 virus, the same person is asked to go to a sample unit at the nearest clinic.
Patresfjörður says the tent area is booked on commodity weekend - directs guests otherwise
Patresfjörg's fully booked this weekend, according to the Western announcement.
When guests point out to look at other communion options.
The West Valley Bildal, Tukunafjörður, Melanes in Red Seasand, Hotel Flocund and Hotel Breníavík as alternatives in the position.
It's enough to stay at the Patekfjörður this weekend, because, as the previous years, Turtle City will be a festival of Icelandic documentarys held in town.
She's been held since 2007 and turned to a stronger tradition in town.
From this year's application to the tent area, a good welcome can be expected, if the weather does not put a bar in a account, but DV said earlier today from a more marked project.
However, may the worst weather in the south, hope for Patrefjörður.
The web cub, first told about, and said that all other beds in town are already booked.
A whole family house collaborates down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live at 18-20 for free in Dunga.
While owners are applying for building permits for renovation, their mission has been established in the system over the course of the third year.
In one of the eldest, the most expensive, costly neighborhoods of Reykjavík City, there's a world-wide house in three stories.
On the ground floor of the building there's about 600 square feet of shopping.
The back of the house is the door of two stairs which each stores four fine apartments.
Are they in the range of 93-130 square metres, although most over 100?
The house has quite a story to store.
It was built in 1959, and including hosting video stores, the School Room, the milk store of LEDs, Joe's gun vouchers, fish sales, and now last college printed.
The house, that it may have been so small, has its luxury to a elephant.
The house is now subject to severe damage as shown on the provided images.
The owner of the house is D18 Elf.
The owners of D18 ehf are according to a business file among other Magnus Magnusson and Guðrun Helga Lárus daughter.
Michael went to the owners of Borg, and was the guardian of the trustee's holdings.
In the stocking of the Borg's holding society, Steelship is an orc.
A steel ship or an investment society of God's Holy Laura's daughter and her children.
Gudruin is also one-third owner of D18 ehf.
Guðrun and her husband, August Guððursson, once run the exiles of Stauladian.
D18 ehf. bought the house the summer 2009, so there's not a lot to hold on to since then.
Neighbors tell me the condition of the house has deteriorated continuously since the most recent years.
On a Facebook page in the neighborhood, one local tells me that the house wasn't particularly live in the past year.
It may be a game that owners have for a few years wasted after changing the house and the coal.
Other neighbors say the house hasn't been all right for a long time.
"It's long time to do something nice to this spot and it's boring that it dragged like this."
He also says that he's pissed off at the owners of the house for not driving himself to finish this, finding a joint surface with the neighbors of the house, and stop that "lawist"!
"Just do it together with the community around so you can get into it and finish it."
"The lawyer" which is set for it is a structure of the field that has been running at least since 2017.
So the Dungallar owners found 18 and 20 after authorisation to build their height on the current condo, and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a building on one floor and a basement.
The build-up provided by this publication was charged with the Environmental and Resource Committee and concluded it from a force where the implementation was not supported in sharing and local reporting was insufficient.
Reykjavíkurbourg then started sharing work and finished it with an advertisement in July Politics last year.
It was also a premeditated order, and it was named in March 2020.
It was therefore almost three years from the original build-up application and owner of the house at the starting site.
The house had been dropped at this time considerably, and the neighbours were ready to faint.
When DV asked the neighbors of the house and the reactions of the neighbors were in different ways.
Some had understanding of the owners of the house, others at all not.
Others set their anger toward the city, others not.
Others were just angry, but they didn't necessarily go out into anyone.
Other people said there was a chateau, but the neighbors have used unused Dungay parking lot under their vehicle.
One of the accusers in this case said there was a long-losion in the county office:
"That we must go through the process in trispury is quite extraordinary.
It's like Reykjavíkurbourg doesn't know how to read.
Today, the house stands empty, abandoned and neglected.
Remembering the hovering seat of the city's administration, and the noble intentions of propriety, and the many years of their work which is now in the beginning.
When a journalist came to the park in Dunga 18, please thank him wide open doors and garbage piles.
A PlayStation computer and a recent TV was running around another piece of trash on the planet - a victim of Icelandic summer beer.
They opened up into the college offices and there a lot of cats smelling like piss.
It is clear that someone has nested himself in one corner but no one is visible.
Scoops of sofas and beds, and some boards of geology pages, which were bound to become a book, beweak.
The phaseways of the apartment building were also open and life in both of them.
A reporter was so lucky to be drifting into one of them.
They were over there to boil their potatoes for dinner and offered a journalist.
The Romanians work for the employees' rent Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, seductions DV that the company has been paid for nothing but heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it's not a good idea to collect rent.
From the management of mails in the lobby of the house it is clear that there have been a number of foreign workers living in the last missers.
Workloaded workers have not been assigned to the Covid-19 situation, an entourage in tourism has led to construction contracts, and these two work practices have been the most effective use of staff workers' services.
Nevertheless, domesticists in Dungas 18 seemed to have had enough to do and stay the worksuits and the poor collaborators to dry up after a long working day in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the pathetic state of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed to be quite maintained.
When a journalist sends his boys a little over the edge of his head, he got the irony straight, and at the best place in Reykjavik, 1,500 square feet, real estated.
Owners want to change the house better and neighbors to improve their condition, but share the definition of "inventilation."
Between that city's planning area is at the beginning of the world, the victim of endless ways of action, and the motives of the planning process and the hovering of the EPA Committee on environmental and resource issues.
In the house, the enthusiastic workers, maybe just those who start to improve their situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The article originally appeared in the DV 17th July weekend sheet.
Excessive weight loss following pandemic crown virus infection
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Boris Johnson, will provide 10 million pounds in the campaign for overweight, which will include forbidden by fast-food commercials, after being severely ill, partly due to its weight.
It proves that Johnson will introduce the campaign, who has been promised better health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign doctors will be encouraged to prescribe bike nests for their clients in overweight and will also be expected to accept the number of wheels.
In which case, there will be a fast-food facility on TV forbidden by 21 p.m., according to the sources of the British media.
"COVID - 19 has raised us against short and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined to use the time to get healthier, more effective and eating healthier food, as a representative of the government.
Johnson himself has had weight problems, but he was committed to intensive care when he had the crown virus in us, and is partly due to his weight being considered to be severely ill.
Women better to lead the changes
Did she say that the new constitution is the largest step the nation can take towards greater power distribution, transparency, and in preventing corruption and the profits of the total.
"We need to start changing the gear a little now and who's better to lead such a change than the group of society who's supposed to be easier by being at these levels.
It's women," said Helga.
"Women in Iceland are famous for their women's condition.
To stick together and stay together to lead changes.
So now it's just time for us to lead these changes.
She said she was a little tense about the focus of Iceland as "best in the world" in both gender-like and human justice.
"Then we're not so ready to see what has to be done.
Like Germans, they're very aware of their history and viewing everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we're from, where we're coming from, know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of selected groups.
We don't live with the same rules here," said Helga.
She said that women are in many ways in great shape in Iceland but added to, like, elsewhere Iceland's residents at tremendously mastruity.
She said that the politics were turned to form about their own interests, authority and power which are the forces that we hold misright in every community.
"Women are now starting this group and coming together and they're just a little pissed off by the fact that the Parliament is about to trek past this national votes from 2012," she said.
"There are those women's low value that we're thinking this out.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation and the fact that we're all actually sitting at the same level," she said and added that earlier values were beginning in the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country of nature, and it is absurd that here are people living with poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change different," said Helga.
"It's ridiculous that there's some natural law that women's work is always lower paid.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses are going to have to stand up in a wide motion just to get a decent salary.
The signature can be signed on a new constitution here via electronic Iceland.
Tried to rob a walking roadman downtown
A man was arrested in downtown last night after he threatened a walking traveler and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of narcotics in a river town where two of them were arrested on the case.
Then the police stopped the driver of a bike wheel in the stairs, where his driver was at 146 miles an hour at a maximum speed of 60 kilometers/hour.
In addition, he had previously been disbarred by driving rights.
The police at the capital area had been busy enough for the night and were listed in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
And then there was very much of a sound announcement about harmony.
On Saturday there was an announcement of eleven noise-related parties which was high in the police diary.
However, last night, 22 noises on the force.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
In the River town, a police were called to-night when the party launched fireworks.
At least they got out of the way when the policemen were up to the park.
Nine drivers were stopped for drunk and drug-driving.
There were four arrests due to downtown fights, but one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were transferred to the emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the middle of the town, and the other in the West Village.
One was transferred to the emergency room after he was injured jumping into a trampoline in Copavogi.
Besides, the policemen stopped a driver who pulled a trailer in Kjalaresi yesterday.
The gear of the trailer was, based on the police diary, in "very bad condition" and was placed still.
You can stay at Monet's house for shopping weekends.
The house, whose impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of her training, is now foreseeing on the website of Airbnb.
Next available night in the house is shopping weekend.
It's a small, cute house, located in the town of Givery, Normandie, France.
The world-famous painter lived in the house since 1883 until he died in 1926.
There are three bedrooms, two parlours, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint her gardens famous in this house.
If anyone's planning to rent this house, he's gotta rent it at least two nights.
Compared to the page of Airb, it's next available after a week, on a Sunday of the storekeepers' place, and it might be perfect for some shopkeepers to be in a hurry to book the house of the painter.
The two nights over shopping weekends don't cost more than 964 American Valley or just over 130 thousand Icelandic votes for what's next.
Tens in anximy, and some of them started to show the signs of the disease caused by the crown virus
Five have been identified with the national crown-protection virus within the last three days, most of which are infected unconjugated.
Tens have come to aweakness and some of them start showing the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were detected with the national crown virus yesterday and two were detected at cross-country.
Histopathologist's office says that a growing number of domestically infected populations do not necessarily spread the virus into the community.
"There's been a series of reports from the previous national transmission, and there's a virus that hasn't been seen here before, so that we have no particular reason to think she's been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that's just arrived in the country, but of course we need to be very careful right now" Hamilla Sigridur Jógódóttir, a specialist at the local anti-piantality.
Most of these people have been infected with individuals who came from abroad.
Further sampling is requested in the near future than some who were in contact with the infected have started to show signs of the crown virus.
"Now, there is no running influenza and reminding of other respiratory infections, so we can be pretty liberal by making these tests for people who during the influenza season would have found reason to do something else first," said Kamailla.
Surgical transmission is nearly complete, but no further disinfectants have to be ruled out.
Two of the infected were detected after a sports event.
Has it made up any questions whether it is forbidden to keep such events?
The head of the P.S. says it's good for as long as people follow the criteria and regulations.
Kamilla says it's almost impossible for the infected to catch their sports.
"If they don't go any more in isolation from these people after having been around them at these sports, we can keep it up to the fact that our inconsistent defences at the tournament have worked.
But it's not revealed," said Kamilla.
The P.R.'s activities are under constant review.
"We need to be ready to take in with further advice or limitations if it seems necessary," said the Camilla.
After more than a week, there will be a number of limits removed to a thousand people.
This new position may affect your suit.
"Won't you think about cooking?"
Elisha Varsdotttir is an amazing woman at the lacrosse and plays with Val.
She's also a master of nutrition, a mother, and works as a food expert.
It takes a lot of energy for today's rain and usually takes time to cook a nice and nutritious meal.
The usual day for me starts by coming to work from eight, says Elisha.
"After work, I'm going to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I pick up my kid at the nursery by 3:00."
Elisa feels very close to picking up her daughter early in nursery school.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to rehearsal the second part.
After rehearsal, it's good to come home and just have to warm up dinner.
At night, when the girl's asleep, we like to watch one part to empty our minds."
Elisha does not follow any diet at all.
She's doing a final hand on a nut job in nutrition science and therefore knows what's right for her to eat to have enough energy to do her work, schools, family and practice.
"What suits me is to eat diverse food which is a good combination of proteins, carbohydrates and fat.
Although it's important for me to have a healthy relationship with food, not to sort foods into a bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
You see, it's okay to eat everything, just not all of a sudden, and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
"I find certain thoughts in standing in the kitchen to cook and get it very much in it.
I have to say, confidence is with me in the kitchen and I can't believe I'm a decent chef.
Breakfast: the sea, the chia seed, the hamp seed, the salt, a little lemon juice, put in the almond milk during the night.
Top this meal, then with whatever you have.
Most of the time, it's banana and mousse & KAFI.
I'm a lot of coffee.
Millions: Unbelievably different, but fruit or vegetables, flatcakes, clean spit with banana and mouseli, bread with a leg, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box, if that's the case.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of foodful salad made from what is in the fridge, china, or barley, falafelbolls, cassaat, overcoatd vegetables with good manners is a little bit of what I'm working with.
If the plan goes out of hand (a lot) then the Egg Machine in my job has really gotten me a lot rescued, and it's 2 pieces of bread with butter, cheese and boiled eggs, no more.
Mitty, get me something carbohydrate-rich for rehearsals, some bread with a leg, some cereal, some fruit.
Dinner, fish will be in my home selection very often, or some delicious vegetarian dishes.
Police conflicts with protesters in Seattle
The city authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared a state of mutiny following multiple protests in the downtown city.
The police grabbed yesterday to flash charges and pepper sprays to tempt to cut down a large area of protesters and stretched over many blocks in the area of the council chamber.
Police reported at least eleven protesters were arrested and an investigation of a saboteur working at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
The city and police authorities say that protesters have stoned police with rocks, bottles, blasts and other loosers and one officer was taken to a hospital in which his injuries were made.
At least the protests in Seattle were peaceful for a long time.
They had a blow to show protesters in Portland, Oregon as part of a state, but in this city, they've been involved in a hard conflict between protesters and heavy-armed U.S. Marshals country.
There, as in the other cities of the United States, people gather under the standards of Black Lives Matter, remember Georges Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25th, protesting a global mob in an American community and requiring improvement.
Do not cancel until after vote
It is not yet known whether the names of the stewardesses of Icelands, which should take effect at the next month's end, will be undone.
The famous voter for the Icelandic airline agreement on the Icelanders' flight attendants for the islands is out at noon tomorrow.
The People say that the Icelands will not decide their resignations until the conclusion of the vote is met.
"This is definitely hanging together," says Godlauding Lyney.
"There have been no rumours canceled; this must begin to lie in order to become the human machines.
Then, of course, people are anxious after they get to know if they'll have work after the month."
It's about a contract signed a week ago, on July 19th.
It is expected that it will be up to the end of September 2025 and based on a contract that the stewardess had previously dropped in votes.
On July 17th, the board and confidentiality of Iceland's Islanding Society produced a general stop in Icelands, it was approved by the social staff.
It never came to her, but this was decided after the Iceland decision to cancel the flight attendantship, reveal all their pilots and seek negotiations with another union.
That's when the pilots of the company had to take in the work of terrorists on board for a while.
Ask her how she thinks the vote will go she'll find it hard to tell.
"The people are hurt after this event of Icelands, when all the airline pilots have been surrendered and reported that the union would be with another union.
Now it turns out if it has any effect" she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelands at the end of April, which included 900 of them, 95% of them.
Their resignation is variable, with those who have chosen the three months of hard work, who have completed the month's course of July.
This group contains approximately 90% of the Iceland airlines.
What's not to be agreed with?
"Then we wish for continued discussion with our clients.
With this deal, we are attending the Iceland requirements.
If he's refused, it's clear that the stewardesses have been pushed too far."
A collective agreement's over, and Icelands are presenting the ends of the second quarter tomorrow.
The flight attendant's vote on a new press deal ends at 12am tomorrow.
The number of Icelands for the second quarter of the year will also be published tomorrow, but interim results suggest that the share income fell by 85 percent from the same period of last year.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic airline agreement and the Icelanding ceremony started on Wednesday, July 22nd, and finished tomorrow Monday, on Monday 27th July, at 12am.
Anyone allowed to vote on the contract are employees of the Icelands who pay social fees to the Flying Island Company.
The Icelands and F.F. signed a new collective agreement on the 19th of July 19th, but Friday before, Icelands had broken up with the union after the flight attendants had a prior agreement in the votes at the beginning of July.
Then the Icelands had told all the airlines and airliners on Friday, but they were dragged back after the new collective agreement was signed.
According to a new brass contract, flight attendants have to fly five hours more per month for their same basic salary.
The paper goes to 2025, where pilot's and flight attendants have been integrated on how long to fly on one shift.
The deal was presented to carers at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and described many air attendants who had a press conference with them on account of the deal.
But most seemed to agree that the contract had to be agreed on in order to keep FFI alive.
In addition, the Agency will be introduced tomorrow to the European Union for the second quarter, it will be introduced tomorrow than the EBIT Company, its intervention for finance and tax, based on preliminary data negative by 100 to 110 million U.S. dollars, or about 15 billion Icelandic krona.
The Icelands sent a preliminary bill last Wednesday, saying that the income of the company has been about 60 million dollars in the quarter or about 8.3 billion crowns.
A hand-to-hand and non-inferiority was about 154 million U.S. dollars at the end of the quarter, around 21 billion krona.
The Icelands are also planning to take out the shares of the company in August.
Icelands are planning to complete negotiations with 15 loan sharks, governments, and Boeing Air Force producers by the end of the month before they go into stock markets.
New variant rather than a new type of virus
"New virus means only that it has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been getting belly in this country," says Maur Kristjánsson, the head physician in U.S. Hospital's infectious department, about the reports that the "new type of virus" have been identified in this country.
Three domestic transmissions were detected yesterday and two were detected at the border.
One who was detected had participated in a social activity of a sports club on the lacrosse Rey Cup, but the source of the disease was unsatisfied and infectious is ongoing.
There were also infected persons who came to the country on July 15th, with two contacts who started to show signs or symptoms of COVID - 19.
In this case, transmission was detected yesterday that was associated with infection reported during the day of the day, and following an Icelandic genetic analysis, the new type of virus that has not been identified was identified.
This transmission of infectious diseases is complete.
It takes place not to have a new virus, but to have the same virus, which has a wide range of virus around the world, i.e. the new crown virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asks what there is and if there's anything else that there's ever been an epidemic that is, like, a single incident, and there might not be anything more.
"But, however, if it arises a case of country that doesn't have ties from abroad and has the same genotype as this particular variant, then a conclusion could be drawn [second wave], but it's untimely at this point" explains the moons.
Oh, my goodness in the hot tub
Is the secret to the Icelanders' happiness hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC calendars lead to the likes of a fun video that keeps the light of the country's pool and potting.
The Icelandic sanitation is special global, and it's certain that there is no place in the world as many people asked for each of them.
The natural locust is their foundation, but also the tradition of the swimming that is in this land.
In 1940, children's break-ins was less efficient in 1940 than older citizens using hot water for health.
Sunways are described as a fixed part of the national well-being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, independent of class and rank.
Free from the cell phone people talk on personal notes around home and space or the pleasure of the water's similar powers: thoughts and sources of batteries of soul and body.
Had to pick up hundreds of days at election time
One hundred days till the Americans go for the election and choose for president to be four years old.
Donald Trump is looking for reelection, but he's supposed to be picking up.
Joe Biden, the anticipated killer of the Democrat Party, has a high advantage for Trump on national level, taking into account the polls.
According to the new AP news poll, the record of the United States has been determined to be in the wrong direction.
Also, for the pandemic of the new crown virus, the reaction of Trump is highly hostile and, in addition, more Americans than before the President has been considered to have problems with economics.
To be precise, only two out of every ten Americans are on the right track.
32 percent reported as supporting the reaction of Trump from the epidemic and 48 percent saying he's been doing well on economic issues.
In March, that was 56 percent and January, that was 67 percent.
On average FiveTirtyEight is followed by a Biden 49.9 percent national while the Trump 4-1.9 percent follow.
Trump himself has tried to turn the attention away from his performance towards the ages that Biden, press the so-called cultures, and declare a policy matter to turn to law and order.
However, Biden's offer is very competitive to keep the attention on Trump and count a great chance of winning in case the vote is actually about how Trump has been working in the last four years.
Looks like the unfriendly Trumps are also going to come down to the Republican Party members and fear the Caretakers that Democrats might even reach the majority of the American Senate League, who so far have been very roused.
Polligico said at dawn that they should stay close to class and candidate and that is now the Republican Party would have its greatest power in decades.
Suburban has been considered particularly poor in the 2016 Parliament and this is a look for this trend to continue.
Trump has spent the last few days trying to scare the suburban population to follow, including saying the price of President Biden will destroy the suburbans of the United States and push suburban battles.
Among other things, Trump has dropped the Regulation since Barack Obama's time in the White House intended to increase diversity in the suburbans.
Then he encouraged the U.S. suburban suburban suburban section to read an article by former governor of New York, where she claimed that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and take Trump under it.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhoods and your American dream.
I'll keep it, and even do it even better!" said the President.
The people of the U.S. suburbans are a growing group of voters all the time.
NPR says they're about half the voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who's got the majority voted for this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mint Romney got the majority votes from this group and lost to Barack Obama.
Explosion checks have shown that despite the fact that Trump guarantees a broad majority in the suburbans of 2016, his co-ordinence has been substantially delayed.
Even if it differs between the probes, Biden has been measured with a 15 percentage advantage in Trump in the hatches recently.
Regis Philbin is dead.
The American TVman Regis Philbin is dead, 88 of his age.
Philbin was acting as an actor, part manager, host and singer for about six decades.
He's one of the most known to control the popular talk shows Live! with Regis at 1988 to 2011 with Kathie Lee Gifford and later Kelly Ripa.
Then he's managed factors like Who Wants to Be a Millionaire and America's GottaTalent.
According to Guinness the World Records, Philbin is the person who's been on most of the hours of television and has been recognised by its chemical.
He's got a six-Emy commission on his job, and he was in total nominated 37 times.
It appears in a declaration from his family that Philbin died of natural wormcakes.
A number of colleagues, friends and fans have mentioned him in society tickets during the last 24 hours.

After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympics, events that only world wars have formed until this time, President of the International Olympics said that the famous Olympics would be "lighted at the end of the walk" and referred to to as expected in a pandemic crown virus as a world-wide citizen now passing through.
Many people have additional years to prepare themselves and the Jap authorities will make up for the delay.
At least everybody keeps his head at stake.
When Tokyo was reported in Japan, the scene of the Olympic Games this year was the favorite of the Japanese representatives for real.
They wept and laughed the other way; for Tokyo had applied to keep the games 2016, but bowed it down in a lower way for Rio in Brazil.
And this time, Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were to go on July 24th to August 9th, but have been postponed for a year, starting with August 23rd, 2021, and ended on August 8th.
If you cannot keep playing them, if the crown virus remains too threatened, the games will be canceled.
No one wants to think that thought to the end, though.
Olympics are no ordinary sports contests.
There's nothing to save, the show should always be great, and always be looking at the top of the last game.
The choice of a city for Olympicism is based on the evaluation of a selection committee on the urban introductions.
The more magnificent the presentation is - the more likely to get a snoot.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to keep the Olympic Games in 2016 or a total of 20 billion crowns.
The second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, there were 75 million dollars, about 10 billion crowns, put in the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided to receive Tokyo this year, Japanese authorities had already protected by 30 billion crowns.
But the amount, however, is just a drop in the ocean based on what it costs to build an Olympic village, a circus, and generally to strengthen the country's infrastructure to deal with, prepare it and keep it itself play.
The Japanese shipmates have said that the Tokyo Olympics, who should have been running these days, but have been postponed for about one year because of the crown virus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, in a report from a federal accountant in Japan who came out at the end of the last year, it was reported that the cost was twice that.
The costs of delaying the games will probably not be fully evaluated, but it has been estimated that it may cost between two to six billion dollars in addition to the initial costs.
So all costs for the Japanese Olympic committee and Japanese taxpayers could run between 15 and 30 billion dollars.
There are so high figures that all the taxes of the Icelandic government only fell for less than half of the Olympics, compared to the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are a product of the magnitude that they have often become economic media, attempting to penetrate numbers and view benefits and benefits of the games.
In the current situation, it seems a lot of people have found that the impact of the Olympics is less than so positive for the urban economy.
Short-term effects are somebody, for example, increasing jobs very much for a short time, but for a long time cities will be sitting up with debtors and threatening operating costs of low use of Engines.
Rio in Brazil is stuck with serious debts due to the 2016 Games and has been having trouble costing maintenance of all the great sportsmen who were built for the games.
After playing in London 2012 numbers, it has been found that only 10 percent of the people who received job in the city were out of work before.
That means there was only a small amount of new jobs.
In general, cities have not been particularly effective in keeping Olympics because of the cost of human activation based on the games.
However, the benefit is considered to be likely to be an increase in travellers who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which is uncertain about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear whether you can take all the number of viewers you normally want to play.
But the principal part is the glory of the cities to be chosen, but it is hard to count for money.
Therefore, with the cost of greatness, it can also be said that the joys taken by the players are not possible to put on them price labels.
But just because the show's a lot of great, and there's nowhere to save it doesn't mean it's just about money.
It's the sports heroes that are on the background.
For some achievements, it's just that it's a pleasure to postpone the games.
The Australian penitentiary and a gold prize holder in her side of Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is for example, casolet and would have been far away from good fun for the summer and would have been desperate to be in competition for the 2021 games.
It is therefore amongst the athletes who are just rather satisfied with the deferral, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who decided to quit after the games this year, they would have been kept on time, means the deferral of the games in some cases that they would quit the race before the games began.
Just don't trust his body to go through another year of strict practice.
Not many athletes got in the hearts of the Olympics in Rio 2016 as the gymnastic star of Simone Bies.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has arrived in several interviews in his home country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She's going to play the 2021, but she's not necessarily sure she's still at the top of the games next year, so she's gonna be 24.
Even if it's not generally considered advanced age, it's a higher number for a gymnastic woman in the front row.
"This is a delicate subject," says BiIIes, but smiles at another interview published on the Instagram website of the Olympic Committee asked if she intends to get evenly on the 2021 games and she did in Rio 2016.
"I just don't know if I'm still at the top after another year of practice," said BiIIes.
She's been talking about how her body can't tolerate the strain of gymnastic training much longer.
Anyway, she's training for the Olympics 2021.
Biles admits that it was an unpleasant feeling to stop suddenly practicing when the pandemic was standing as high as the gym was shut.
There were no accesses for Bilees rather than others while all sportsmen were closed for seven weeks.
All her Olympic gold couldn't buy any account above the others. She had to find various ways to stay in shape like others.
It's certainly a bit better than most people.
"We have a stiff plan now.
It was hard to start practicing first after the gym opened.
We started slow, but we're back on the stage again, and I'm going to be increasing my exercises as hard as I'm going to go for the year.
Of course, we don't know exactly how these games will get or whether they'll be held, but we'll practise for them to become, and that's all we can do.
I've been working too hard to leave the sport now," says Bies.
With her like more snoozes, or maybe more consciousness that position can come up with the 2021 games at all.
Considering it's hopeless, though.
No one can know what the pandemic king's cap will be like in July 2021, and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics, relative to their annual activities.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid exits.
Postponing of the childhood due to an outbreak
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding for the crown virus.
She was supposed to marry the former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
"We'd like to marry ourselves sometime and have the dream wedding and have all that we care about.
But we decided to beat it off and focus on what's important right now and it's helping to share information on the importance of wearing masks and keeping it at home.
I'm looking at more world affairs than wedding fights these days.
There's a lot going on and we're supposed to focus on what's going on in the world."
