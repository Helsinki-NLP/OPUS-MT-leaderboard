Laughing at the World
The marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland thinks it's a good start, and shouting and shouting in the wild are pulling people around the world.
"You have the nod, I need Iceland," said one woman outside the great world in comments to an ad from the marketing campaign Looks Like You Need Iceland on the state of YouTube.
Another observer claims that he will preserve Iceland in her heart for all eternity, and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible, for her fiancé lives there.
Unfortunately, though, she is in the United States and thus assumes that she will have to wait another month.
Another observer asks if the trip to Iceland is good, because there are no planes.
There's no way to tell if he's coming from another time zone.
Thorddarson's member of the Peel Advertising Agency, along with M&C Saatchi International Advertising Agency, says the audience has been hoping again.
"I came to many inspired by the Iceland campaigns that have gone very well but this new campaign is already entering the record.
In the foundation it's about making PR, that's getting foreign media to talk about the campaign, and it's gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short time, we have discussed some seven hundred media coverages worldwide, covering over two billion people in total.
The value of this coverage is worth $1.8 billion.
That's not embarrassing.
The main market is the United States, and the campaign has been very successful there, although America is not on its way to the country in its own time.
According to Egls, such market areas as Denmark, Britain, and Germany have also responded well, as Russia, which is a convenient surprise.
Then there were reactions from exotic areas, such as India, which were not specifically proposed.
" These advertisements have gone beyond our expectations, " says Eric, "but it may be possible that more than four million people have watched the information on YouTube.
"We couldn't have wished for a better start."
The pictures here on the opening took The Age of Sólberg, a photographer of the Morning Press, on the film of advertisements bearing the heading "Let It Out " in the middle of the last month.
The tables went on wide and wide, such as the Reykjavík Schoolkeeper, the Swamp, the Forest Falls, the Sunworld, and the cave by the Cape of Hjorn.
The directors were Samuel Bjarki Petersson and Gunnar Paul Olafsson of Hunting and Fear the Son of God.
The roles used included Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, from Cuba and Hungary.
Tens of Iceland made advertising, but at the same time in the South, there was another group in the Westland and West.
According to Egls, "Let It Out" is only the first team in the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but winter campaigning is scheduled for cooperation with M&C Saatchi.
"This is just the first phase of this job for an Iceland lab," said Eric, and added that the M&C Saatchi partnership was going very well.
"It's great working with them.
It's important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets we're talking to. "
Explosion: Communicating job position, pension fund, and many more
Ásmundur Einar Dadason of the Department of Social Affairs and Child Affairs, will be in an explosionand, starting at 10:00 on the Wolf Today.
He is also a labour secretary, discussing the workforce as such, the Icelanda, and other issues.
He also discussed national affairs and transport in a land that has failed and has been disputed over the past few years and decades.
Robert Thor Ingolfsson, president of VR, also shows up in the program, but he will discuss his financial investments and suggest that labor movements and professional drivers reduce the risk of conflicting interests.
This will be discussed with Ivar Ingmarsson, a traveling minister in the East, and the year - old daughter of Jon, the director of the National Marketing Office, about the situation of tourism in the region.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer will be misleading evidence of what will come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10.
This is what she looks like today 25 years later
Actress Elisa Donovan had a successful career on teenagers of any kind.
Worldly fame, however, came before her game as Amber in the movie Clueless 25 years ago.
At that time, she also played the Sabrina series: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been seen in her lately, but she was moved to look back and express herself about Claless in Australian television during the days.
She speaks beautifully of Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009, saying that she was a wonderful person.
"I must admit that I based my character mostly on girls I met at school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who that person was," Donovan said about his game in Cluless.
Didn't want to leave the police station after night stay.
About 50 cases came on the table of the police in the capital area today, and the police reported in the police diary that the situation was varied.
The day at the Nautilus police station began with the forced intervention of a police officer who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there because of drunk driving.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the direction of the police who told him to leave.
The man sees the ongoing stay at the police station because of his progress.
Then a man was arrested in the morning, suspected of burglary in a company in Kopavogi.
There were also two police involved in Breinholti because of reports of assault.
Then, too, a woman reclining at a shopping mall in Kópavogi could not pay for the check after a meal and was called to the police.
There were also reports of theft in the downtown car this morning.
The driver of a white Renault van, who was temporarily taken from her, was taken without permission.
The car hasn't been found.
The Curse of the Conspiracy - A Frightening Destiny for the Gole Stars
The theory has caught flights on the Internet to curse the series of happy bands, while an actress Naya Rivera drowned in California during days and became the third of the shows in order to die prematurely.
The episode on the happy countryside (Glee) is a popular series of songs, dances, and joys.
These factors covered a so - called happy band of youths in high school, their love, and their destiny.
It was not always taken out with the joy band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the show seemed to cover whatever situation arose in their lives.
But beyond the location of the film, players and employees have suffered disaster, so much so that theories have aroused that the program was cursed.
Naya Marie Rivera took the role of Santana Lopez in the shows, a cheerleader who didn't call all his grandmothers.
After the series of events had passed, Rivera married actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
However, Dorsey refused to press charges, and her domestic violence was dropped.
On July 8 of last year, Riveru was announced to be missing after her four - year - old son was found driving a boat all by himself on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat, and he could tell the police from the fact that he and his mother had committed a swim, and then Rivera would have put him back in the boat and never returned there herself.
Extensive search for Rivera rose.
The day after the search, the local police chief explained that the search for Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially ordered dead.
It is believed that it was in a massive stream of water and that it was the last thing needed to save the son.
Cause of death was recorded as accidental drowning.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith took the role of the Finn Hudson in the show, the American football player with the angel's voice playing a key role in bringing honor and honor to the happy band.
Outside, however, Monitth faced personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape.
In 2013 his fellow workers were feeling that they had had done enough work, intervened, and encouraged him to seek help.
Monith then went to treatment and seemed to be all looking for a better treatment.
Only two months after he finished treatment, Monitth was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banana cancer was found to be a lethal combination of drugs and alcohol.
It was not thought that there was a will.
Monith had been treated and his tolerance for drug abuse had been reduced to such an extent that the dose he had previously tolerated well, was fatal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death was heavy on his coworkers, but at the instigation of his lady lady Leah Michele, he was determined to continue the program and devoted them all to Finn's memory.
Mark Wayne Salling took the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in his show; Puck was an American football player, like Finn; and he had little respect for his fellow students in the gladdens, or all the way to the point where he became discouraged to admit that he enjoyed singing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested in his home in Los Angeles.
A search of houses in his house felt that a huge amount of child pornography was involved, and the matter soon spread publicly.
Clearly, Salling had been finished.
As a result, he was accused and convicted of his wrongdoing.
He had a four - to seven - year prison head in addition to having to keep records of sexual offenders and seeking treatment for child sacrifice.
Before a judge determined the punishment, Salling, who was then released on bail, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It was not just actors who died from a long time before.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
In 2013 he became very hungry in his sleep, only 41 years of age.
On the show, a woman named Nancy Motes was also won.
She was the younger sister, Julia Roberts, whose sister was not the most beautiful of history, but she accused Roberts of great control and disrespectful conduct.
In 2014, Motes took her own life, but she suffered from major depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé, who gave her mother and sisters a letter that included responsibility for her situation.
"My mother and so - called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that it was the ones that caused my worst depression."
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of bullying and bullying her companions at the scene of the movie and having overhauling stars.
In 2012, Jesse Luken played a guest part in the program.
In 2019 he was arrested and charged with drunk driving, a scandal.
The actress Heather Morris played a major role in the program.
It happened in 2010 that in the United States, a sledgehammers were exposed to nude pictures of it and published on the Internet.
The actors Melissa Benosist and Blake Jenner both played in the show and had an affair outside the show.
Benoist later reported that Jenner was violent in her relationship.
You can put flowers on almost everything
Children are strengthened when they are allowed to play in the garden with their parents to cultivate flowers and to observe them grow and thrive.
It is also impossible to do with flowers such as Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the children in the park is something that never forgets.
They will remember the flowers, the scent, and, of course, the precious time they enjoyed with their parents.
Buying a boat after the tenth grade
"I don't think we're a lot of sailors working at the national acting schools," says Axel Eagle Guðmundsson, who is involved in coastal fishing in the summer but who studies psychology at Iceland's University during the winter"
Coastal fishing is a very pleasant summer job when you are studying.
If the fish are the best, you can make good money, and I love not being able to take a student's loan.
In fact, Alex Guðmundsson, a 25 - year - old psychology student who spends the summer fishing for beach fishing, says Alex Guðmundsson.
Alex was new to be docked on the peninsula when a journalist approached him late at night at the start of the week. "
"The spring I was in the tenth grade, I took the privileges of command for boats less than 40 feet [12 m] long, and I bought my boat the summer after I finished my elementary school.
I've been on my boat all summer.
I bought the boat used by a friend of mine, Hartmann Jonsson, and I named it his name.
When I bought the boat and stopped being at sea, Hartmann was already an adult, and he was very pleased when he saw that the boat bore his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat, " Alex says, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
"I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer, and the other half at the end of the summer when I had caught.
So at the end of this first summer of my life, I had a boat that was in debt. "
How, though, could a boy have an hour and a half million to pay off in a boat when he had just finished high school?
"I had already laid up and gathered money; I had been working with my dad to sea when I was a boy; I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my bar mitzvah money into my boat fund."
Axel was born in Isafjörður, where his mother's mother is from, but he's lived in Kopavogi since he was a boy.
"I can hunt here in the West, because I have a legal home at my grandmother's house.
I learned from those areas west of here from calms with my father.
I move between the distances, depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the whole vest.
Although I like to be in the West, I have also hunted around the Snowstone and beyond.
I've also hunted south, but then I've got a gray patch, Alex says, who always runs one early stop in the morning and says that he sometimes talks to the seagulls and sings to heaven in the singles for hours in the prom sea.
"The National Union at sea is good, so I can call, listen to music and music.
I don't think it's easy to be on my own.
Of course, I try not to get into danger, but, of course, something's been wrong with the weather, but never a great danger, says Axel, who is lucky that he's never seasick.
He says that the length of the work day depends on the quality of the fishing.
"In the beach weather, I'm never more than 14 hours at once, but I've also been catching other systems, for example, in rent clovers, when I've been stuck for a day and a half in the fishing business."
According to the coastal fishing industry, he can hunt some 70 pounds [770 kg] a day that he feels inhibited.
"Other restrictions are that I must not hunt Friday, Saturday and Sunday, and I may only hunt twelve days a month, these four months of beach fishing, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, sailors should choose their days of fishing for the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is to be calm instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and being able to make a choice.
Then, according to Alex, the regional shift could be caused by me and a radio that is well located at the fishing grounds, " Alex says, which brings most codfish from seawaters to shore fishing, but also only floggings and some other types of rivers.
Axel works for wintertime with his college degree at Núpi in Kopavogi.
"I don't think we're a lot of sailors at the local playgrounds," Alex says proudly, adding that he was only supposed to work at the nursery temporarily.
"I got stuck there because I think this is a great job.
I hope that my psychology program will benefit me at the future nursery class, " says Axel, who is also a very advanced business student.
Reservation error conducted by a return-authority error
An error in a registration sheet, which was published when people arrived in the country, led to the failure of an individual living here on land to be called back to a sample.
It is not necessary to record a social security number if the person fills the form in English, as is the case in English.
"This will be examined this week," says a biochemist expert.
Three internal infections were detected in the virological department of the Land Hospital yesterday.
One of those who proved positive came to the country on July 15, two days after the rules of a so - called returnseptic technique went into effect.
The people living in Iceland are then screened at their arrival and again announced a sample four or five days later.
On lunch news, however, it was reported that the individual had applied to the old system.
The samples on the border were negative and were not called back for viral screening.
In a conversation with a news agency, Kamilla Ruth Sigfusdótttótttir, an expert in the Center for Disease Control, says that this is due to an error in the electronic registration form.
The CDL is not a requirement for installing a social security number, as is the case in the Icelandic language.
Even so, it has been thought of primarily for foreign tourists.
Therefore, if the person has not received an automatic test report.
Kamilla, however, reports that many people have followed the procedures of a returnseptic techniques, although they have filled the writing form in English and in some cases have also been alert to return samples after they arrived in the country.
"This will be examined in the week how it can be easier for people to draw their attention to the process."
The man is in isolation, and six have been infected.
They all take samples, but two had started showing symptoms.
The number of infections diagnosed yesterday is now in progress, mainly due to the two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the serial analysis by the Icelandic genetics revealed that this is a form of chorionic virus that has not been found here before.
In one case, while the virus was known to be exported to other European countries, Israel had also been confined.
Kamilla says it should be in the morning where the other virus came from.
A total of 15 are in isolation according to the vacD. is available.
135 are under a contagion.
Four of five non-linked infections
Five internal infections have been identified here in recent days.
Four of them are completely unplugged and do not form the origin of the virus that came up at the Rey Cup Sports Meeting yesterday.
Transmission is still ongoing.
The original number of people in the first tens of them was highly diseased, which was reduced to sixteen.
Overall, 34 are infected with these new infections diagnosed yesterday.
This second time in a short period of time, it has raised questions as to whether such events should be held.
John K. Jonsson, director of the Federal Police Department for Disease Control, says it is quite slowly, as long as people follow standards and rules.
"We constantly warn all those who live here that there must be an individual protection.
We also need to give attention to people who are observing events that have specific rules to follow.
Then you can have an event, says Jon.
He says that the air of individualised infectious shielding can be prevented.
In addition, rules and guidelines are being revised continuously.
"What needs to be done, and what the public defence and the surgeon generals keep telling people, is to consider these individualised transmission measures.
At home, as well as at service companies.
That people wash their hands and use alcohol.
" This prevents infections from moving on, " says Jon.
"We need to counsel people to continue their fine journeys on which we were on, in order to maintain the success we have so far."
40% of the COVAD-19 victims had diabetes 2
Devon Brumfield heard through the phone how difficult her father had to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, so she encouraged him to seek medical help.
The next day, he was dead.
The container was attributed to sudden respiratory complications due to choroidal viral infection.
Diabetes mellitus was identified as an underlying problem and is Brumfield, also a case of diabetes, fearful that the same work will take place.
Reuters the press says Brumfield's fears are not unfounded.
The figures of a new study made by the U.S. authorities show that less than 40% of those who had diabetes as their underlying disease were diabetics.
When the proportion of subjects not reached 65 years of age is checked, the ratio increases to half.
The U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) study included over 10,000 people in 15 countries who died from the crown virus between February and May.
According to CDC, Jonathan Wortham, an expert on infectious diseases, is striking, especially for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
During the slow growth of Reuters, the results from the 12 countries that responded to similar proportions were reviewed.
10 countries, including California, Arizona, Colombia, are not yet reporting underlying diseases.
"Diabetes was already an epidemic of slow growth.
Now, at the University of Chicago, Reuters, by Elber Huang, has been broken through by COVAD - 19 as powerful centuries.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and South Americans, who also have been found to be less severe from the Korean virus.
One of the best protection for those with diabetes is to control your condition through exercise, diet, and health care professionals.
However, the crowning virus epidemic has made it difficult for many to keep routines.
At that time, some people have been forced to go back to work and thus stop being exposed to the virus.
Reuters notes that the risk to those with diabetes 2 may be due to the virus, which the United States authorities have been aware of.
In 2003, when SAS Koreans crossed over 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine epidemic of 2009, this group was three times more likely to have to go to the hospital.
When MERIAL did so in 2012, one study showed that 60% of those who died or were taken into intensive care were diabetic.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, scientist at Yale University, said that since the effects of the COVAID-19 virus might have been longer, the epidemic of the number of previously unsurpassed complications has been removed.
"I'm afraid we'll see a wave of problems when this is over," says Andrew Bolton, president of the international diabetic organization.
Doctors have warned that the Korean virus epidemic may cause an increase in diabetic complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new research may lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says that scientists are trying to understand the link between the crown virus and diabetes.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs, and kidneys, an organ that is already affected by many people with diabetes.
Then a high glucose and lipid ratio in diabetics can induce a truly called "cytokinestorm', as it is called when the immune system responds to and attacks the body.
Malformed endothelial cells can also lead to inflammation, which can cause fatal blood clots to form again.
"This is all one big puzzle," says Dela Cruz.
"It's all connected with one another."
The story has been corrected.
"We were offered champagne, then they left the room"
Ásrún Magnún and Atli Bollason, a married couple who had sex in front of a camera in front of a project that the artist was setting up in Paris.
"We loved each other, so it wasn't complicated."
Atli Bolton never forgets the first time he meets his wife and nursing mother, Ásún Magnúsa.
"I was very fascinated by her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but then I thought it was completely unreceptive.
He says it's still true."
Ásrún remembers this too.
"I am always to hear this story.
Last weekend, she says, which also attracted her husband to the first impression.
"I felt and feel so agitated around Attla, which I like.
There's a lot going on and a lot going on, and I was fascinated by it. "
Atli says that he and his wife have emphasized the importance of taking their own steps.
"We don't tie our baloney to the same knots as companions.
We avoid the routines we articles around us. "
There is a possible reason why they took the information from Rönar Kjartanson's artist only rejoicing, even if that were the least unusual.
"Christina Anna, our mutual friend, is in touch with us and asks if we can come to dinner Desert with him, Raggi and Ihold Ragnar's wife, on Snaps."
They accepted the invitation, met the trident at Snaps, and had desert wine, and received each dessert.
They listened to Ragnar, who led them through his plans to a show of art that he intended to set up in Palais de Tokyo, Paris, in the fall.
"He had a multi-channel repair called scines from the wit.
He simply described it. "
Ásrun said that he described the work as killing and pamadent scene from the Western life of everyday life.
"He had a shoe of all the scenes he was going to shoot, and last time he told us about what he wanted to know if we were interested in taking part."
The scene that Robert asked the couple to join was to show young middle - class members to love in a minimal room.
"This is intercourse with the beginning and end," says Atli.
The couple did not know much about Ragnar, who knew about him and him, "but they knew us and felt that we fit in.
They said they didn't want to advertise people.
They may have felt that they would not get the right people but that people who would get sexual wisdom from performing to others. "
They said goodbye to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn't take long.
"When we walked out of Snapps we said: " Aren't we ready for this?
It was just like that.
"I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Ásún and Atli.
"It's about love and drawing near."
The scene was picked up in a nice apartment on Snow Street.
There was a very small number of movie teams; there was a cameraman, Ragnar, a soundman, and a couple.
After the recording, all left the room to wait in the car except Atli and Ásún.
"We hadn't decided what to be.
We received a few instructions, but we tried to forget time and place.
Being unaware of what we were doing and for whom.
There was no game, we just loved each other, so it wasn't complicated," says Ásrún.
But was it romantic?
"Yes, it was a bit romantic," says Atli, and Ásún agree with that.
"We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little bit like vacationing at a fancy hotel in Paris.
The team's performance in the move was appreciated.
"When Tommi the cameraman watched this, he cried; he thought it was so beautiful," said Atli.
"It's about love as much as it's getting closer to self-drunk," says Ásrún.
The couple's parents have seen the project and will tell Atli that their mother heard the son's voice in the art gallery in Reykjavík, and then they realize that he was part of the project.
"Then she turns around and starts thinking about this," says Atli.
"Mom and dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn't told anyone that way, but then Dad just texted me and says, "I like to meet the little family in Palais de Tokyo."
And would the participation have deepened the relationship between Ásrunar and Atla?
"At least we're still together, so maybe it deepened something.
At least this deepened my relationship with my family in law, " says Ásrún, and he laughs.
Ásún himself saw the work in Copenhagen with her coal.
"I found it a little difficult not to be with you but with someone else," she says and turns to her husband.
"But it was nice to see this because this is just one scene in a much bigger piece and when you saw this with the other works, it's very cool.
I had a chance to break away from this, and I was just proud.
And there was that little bean in my stomach, " says Ásrún, who was pregnant with the second child of the couple when the scene was picked up.
"That was just beautiful."
Anna Marsibil Clsen spoke with Ásún and Atla in Love Stories on Channel 1.
Swansea with victory in the first semifinal game
Swansea won 1-10 over Brentford in a dramatic game.
It was the first game of the team in the semifinals of the game of getting to the top of the English department.
The game was held at Swansea's home in Wales.
The score in half is 0-0.
The locals of Swansea got a hell in 64th minute, but Andre Ayew failed the arctic arts of the crime scene and had them protected.
Just two minutes later, Rico got Rico Henry, player Brentford, the red card.
So Brentford played the rest of the game a man less, and at 82 seconds, Swannea players used their team members.
Andre Ayew then made up the hatching by challenging a great goal and loyalty to Swannea 1-0 victory.
Thus, Swansea leads 1-0 to the duel, but the second game will take place next Wednesday at Brentford's home.
5 - year - old ambassadors since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in front of the press after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard in whom he was afraid for his life.
However, the president of the United States has been struggling to appoint an ambassador in this country.
Since the release of the office of the U.S. ambassador in April 2009, there has been no ambassadorship in the country for more than five years in the past 62 months.
Van Voorst, who, under peculiar circumstances, reported 2009 that she should have been given the Falcon words.
On her way to a farewell meeting with the president of Iceland, she received a phone call from the Oval Office that she would not be honored.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations with Army War College.
Sixteen months passed before a postman named Van Voorst, in September 2010.
To some extent, Robert S. Connan had been appointed as ambassador and then canceled.
Finally, Loius Ariega had been serving in the foreign service for decades.
Then, in the fall of 2013, he retired and took over the office of an ambassador in Guatemala.
Then came the second ambassador - to - day period.
Robert Barber, who was approved by the U.S. Congress in January 2015, came to work shortly thereafter, at which time no ambassador had been present for 13 months.
Barber was a political officer rather than a diplomat, but he had worked as a lawyer and supported Barack Obama's campaign.
On January 20, 2017, as is customary with a political ambassador, Donald Trump took over the presidency.
Trump's administration took an unusual time to appoint both ambassadors and high officials in the Washington government system.
So two years passed before the U.S. Congress announced Jeffrey Ross Gunter's appointment to inquire of him and confirm after that as an ambassador in Iceland.
In his testimony at the council, he said that he had never been to Iceland, but often to Western Europe, his dead wife had been broken by Dutch berries.
Gunter, a political officer who was formerly a dermatologist in California, has been prominent in the Jewish Democratic Association, the Republikican Jewish Coalition.
It was founded by Sheldon Adelson, an organization that Adelson is an intense supporters of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to Iceland in May 2019, where no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, the longest available in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump's administration was to appoint people in key positions as well as that during the past few years the defeat of the U.S. Congress has been greatly delayed, including confirming the office of ambassadors.
Thus, since 2009, a total of over five years have been ambassadors in Iceland.
However, this has not prevented construction by the embassy, which recently opened the headquarters of the Entigation Council.
The project was estimated to have cost about 6.5 billion, but the protective safety walls surrounding the building are surrounded, with bullet - resistant glass in all windows.
It seems, however, that it did not have enough to fill the present ambassador with security, for he is said to be afraid of his life and wanted an armed bodyguard.
A former U.S. player was exposed to Rasism in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland."
Tonny Mwejje, a former U.V. player, claims to have been exposed to Rasism when he was in Iceland and that he regrets coming to the country.
This is shown by an interview with Tonny, which appeared on the Ugandian Media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined the Uganda Police FC forces in Uganda's top section.
During the meeting with the Daily Monitor, Tonny discussed many activities, including her time in the country, which he played with the IBV, Val, and Root in Iceland.
"When I got to Iceland, I didn't play in the middle like I used to play.
The team leader was in that position, but he also had the bellet number I wanted so I didn't get either of what I wanted, says Tonny, who played on the right side of the season with IBV.
Tonny's share is rasism, which he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
"This once happened to me, but since I didn't understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I learned about the case, and then I asked a friend what the problem was.
He then told me that after I tackled him, my opponent made a racist statement about me. "
In 2014, Tonny, from Iceland, went to Norway, where he joined Hugasund.
There he says that he made the biggest mistake he ever saw.
Tonny had not been able to get himself to the White House starting team, but he wanted to play more to join the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on loan, but he joined Val.
"It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I'd been in Norway longer then I'd have had the chance I wanted," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he were to play well in Norway he'd probably get further.
He wants to say that a loan to Iceland killed his dreams of getting into a major part of Europe.
Found a woman's throat orm in a woman's throat
At St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo, doctors found a woman's tonsils had a long black worm in her neck.
Doctors managed to pull out the worm with a thread.
A study showed that parasites were present.
CNN's reporting.
The woman had eaten a few days earlier, which is thin meat.
The woman recovered quickly after the worm was removed, but parasites such as these are often contained in raw meat or fish.
According to CNN, after sushi cleared up in Western lands, the number of cases of parasites in which they have been exposed has increased.
Fear of another wave starting in Europe
Spain is now focused on concern over another wave of Europe's crown virus, where governments have reactivated the spread of the Korean virus.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona, where the number of infections is increasing.
Other European countries have also taken action for the spread of infectious diseases in Spain, but Britain, like Norway, has to go to an environment where everyone needs to go home from Spain, and France has been warned of traveling to Spain.
In France and Germany, there is also a resurgence of infection, where governments try to find the balance of viral spread and to restore the economy.
The situation in Europe, however, is good compared to the rest of the world, but the rate of worldwide transmission of infectious diseases is 300 thousand per day, with the largest reported transmission in America and South Asia.
The rate of confirmed infection is 16 million worldwide, as determined by Johns Hopkins University, with deaths confirmed to be associated with virus becoming 644 thousand.
Finally, the Work of the Earth Will Be Enjoyed to the Full
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavík is a large, deep hole.
It has orange helmets on top of it.
There's a big dig there, too.
And other smaller machines.
The street is closed by traffic.
But the sidewalk is good, and now many stop there and contemplate the work of millions of mossic ice art - as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they've never seen it before.
At least not respected.
The work has so far been quite hidden, directly in front of them were parking lots that were always besieged.
People parked there, locked their cars in a hurry, and then jumped off to care for their business in the center of the city.
"Present and versatile public space " and the modern - day "stabble of urban events " provide a light for the rebuilding of the modern Trygvest Street.
The goal is to enhance the beauty of the area, allowing the mold to make Helgadóttir at the Tollhouse a more pleasant sight.
In the past, there will be a square, and with the sun in place, it is considered to be a suitable dwelling area for road users.
The art work will be illuminated, and now the plant will be able to enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square - foot [12 square m] surface.
There will also be small "sprayers " - a kind of water sphere, which allows us to perform a game and give the area a certain mystery.
This is how the improvements are made by the city of Reykjavík, which is now being carried out with hosts.
We're going to have a new water supply, a heating system, and a power system.
Many of them are in their years, but the sewage and cold water laws have been serving people and companies in the middle of the town for nearly a century.
When the street is reassigned, cars can drive through it again.
At the same time, it becomes a single - course street, creating a calmer and more accessible space for walking.
A study of the Tollhouse on the customs manager's web says that the house was in use in 1971, an architect of Gísli Halldorsson.
As a result of a dock, a 200 - square - foot [250 square m] window surface was formed to cross the street.
A building committee and architect agreed that such a surface would adversely affect the overall picture, without any special arrangements to adorn the appearance of the house.
So members agreed to expect to have these produce permanent works of art.
During that time, Helgadóttir's work went on to make a lot of words, says the summary.
She had worked very hard in Germany and elsewhere.
The decision was to contact her first contact before deciding whether any competition for the project would be established.
Often, the project had been discussed as a reflection of life on the dock, since the port had been executed since its construction.
When a woman was interviewed, she had to get a crush on such a project.
She agreed to receive drawings and other assistance before leaving the country, where she would work the suggestions abroad.
She had the time she decided on her own, and when she returned home, she offered some suggestions for a discussion.
Without delay, she was agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, it was requested to make a total agreement with it and the famous art company in Germany, the brothers Oidtmann, who had long worked with them in the construction of famous arts throughout Europe.
Contracts were prepared to prepare the art for their brothers, who were in charge of the preparation of the Tollhouse.
All the work was outstandingly done, both by the actions of the daughter of Helga and by the Oidtmann, says in the summary.
Ever since then, it has stood up to an uninterrupted Icelandic weather.
It took some two years to do the work that was done and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the Tollhouse project was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing to export more institutions to the country
Ásmund Einar Dadason of Social Affairs reports that more government agencies will be exported to land in the near future.
That's what a minister in the show said there's an explosion on the Wolf at lunchtime.
Recently it was announced that the firefields of the House and Civilization Institute will be moved north in a sheepfold in the fall.
Six fire transport experts are working at the Agency, but none of them intend to follow the North Institute and have the European Union of Fire and Emergency Transporters criticized the move.
"I think we should take further steps into this creature.
I'm preparing to make further preparations for this thing.
More transportation, said Ásmund.
If he is convinced that the vast majority of the people want to see more distribution of the public institutions around the country.
"I think it may be necessary to make further political decisions on the move of public employment to the country, just as I was doing with a Homeland and Human Resource Institute," said Ásmund, who also took an example of other agencies that have been exported to the country and was of great importance to fellow societies in the country, such as the transfer of Food Agency to Selphoss, Iceland's National Hospital to Aclins, and unemployment insurance on the Skagga coast.
All the highlights of Masters' Second Day
Iceland's 94th Championship for free sports ended at Thorsfield in Akureyri today.
Several objections were made on the second day of the race.
In 2014, an exciting battle in the battle between women at Thorsville was expected, but Vigdísdóttir of FH put Iceland's record in a sledgehammer, which lasted as long as Elizabeth Ruth Rúnarsdóttir of IR was evaluated in May.
Viggids has won the Icelandic record back in the summer and has recently been having sleazy plans, but she has tripled the sum of summer record.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with an injury and has failed to recover today.
She had only one strike of five, threw 25,69 meters [25,69 m], far from her best.
Veronica threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 feet in her final experiment, setting an assembly record at that time.
In July, she set her record early in July with a record 62.69 metres, so she was quite different.
Guðnar Karitas Hallg Monstersdóttir of IR had the second best strike of the day, but she improved her best performance with a throw of 50.18 feet [50.18 m].
Men's group won the F.H. Hilmar Eagle Jonsson, the Icelandic record holder, a safe victory, and he threw 73.84 meters in his next attack and set an assembly record.
His Icelandic record in this article is 75.26 meters.
The Guðni Valur Guðnason, Olympics, and Iceland record record record holder in a mall, won a round ball at Thorsfield yesterday, but today he was running for a roundabout, which is his prime piece.
The international record of the Gods Vals is 65.53 meters, but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured his victory.
Valmira Hjalti Erlendsson, who threw his second leg today, had one valid pitch that worked for the second seat, 49.43 meters.
Merdi Sigurdirdótttir, Iceland record holder of a long jump, won the long-freaking contest, while Merdis jumped the longest 625 yards [6.25 m] today, which is less than 40 cm [40 cm] from her Iceland meal.
In a 200-yard run of women, it was the God of Jóna Bjarnadóttir, who was the fastest runner in the race, but it was at the finish of 24.04 seconds and its Icelandic record in this article is 23.45 seconds.
In Akureyri, Gulbundona won two gold medals yesterday, in a 100 - meter race, and in a 4 x 100 - meter race as well as a 4 x 400 - meter race today.
In the male group, Sir Francis Handur Gunnson from FH was the first to finish in the 200-yard race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds before Olaf Málna Samuelsson from Aarman.
Like the God of Jónda, Sir Francis Hödur won gold in the 100 yards yesterday as well as in the 400 - meter race.
Can't get a ticket for a $ 27 million Bitcoin crop
The head tax committee has refused the demand of an tax investigator who demanded a fine for neglecting his capital pay made up of the Bitcoin version.
The committee concluded that the tax investigator did not give clear reasons why it was necessary to fine the man.
The Commission decided that the tax investigator felt that the person had given the standard of material tax returns for the 2016 and 2017 income.
He would have underestimated his capital gains, which would come from a sale of the electric coin Bitcoin of 27 million, either on purpose or by his grand novice.
The man should be fined for his conduct.
So the man rejected it in a letter to the committee.
Yet, he succeeded in selling 27 million by 2016.
It would have been with digging in 2009 and 2010, when such things had been both easy and unofficial with a normal home computer.
Then he pointed out that when he sold his battery money, a tax work on account of such a sale would be quite vague and unpredictable.
The next step would have been to expect citizens to recognize such tax contributions.
He would not have avoided paying taxes on the crop and would have reported his property on the subject of foreign currency.
He would have asked both professionals and tax managers about how this was done but in vain.
He felt that he would have to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and that he had lived here for only a few years when he started digging for bitcoin.
So he would have been in a worse position than others to study a complex rule that the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view of.
So the man felt that his taxes for those two income years would be redetermined and under pressure but otherwise would not be punished.
Then he repeated that he worked in Iceland and had paid taxes in this country since 2012.
He would never have intended to get out of his responsibilities in a way that was inaccessible.
The requirement for guilt would be excessive and would bring him into debt.
" This man understands what football is " is.
Andersen Willumsson's crowns have been quite intertwined, but it's also impressed by the progress of its past with Brenublik in the Pepsi Max League.
They'll be in the line of fire tonight when they deliver IA live on Channel 2 Sports.
Well, it's a bridge that takes out a playout for four reminders during the season, so it doesn't play with a new haircut like the summer's games so far.
He had had "Blah, blah, blah" written on his head for the game at HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
"I don't know exactly who he was answering with the payment, but speaking of the character then this one was rather better trying in the game.
He didn't go underground.
He wants the ball for every single time, and if someone was going to settle this game, I thought he would either do it or make it, " said Guðmundur son of Benedicte, in the Pepsi Max Lodge, when it was thought that it would be funnier.
"I'm supposed to be here for the people."
"It is difficult sometimes to realize what position he is in.
He looks out a little on the left when the game starts to pass, but he's got a very free load on the team," said Hjörvar Nautilus.
" No one shares this as a character, " says Brynlf, "and rejoices at getting such a colorful man in the department: "No one shares the fact that it is a character.
It's a fun type, and I love it with my hair, and always be ready to show up and answer interviews.
There's an amazing lot of people in his head, who tell me that man understands what football is.
"I'm an entertainer.
I'm supposed to be here for the people and enjoy them."
The people are reading the interviews with Brynlf, people are paying themselves in, and they are observing what is next on his hair.
This man is just a genius, said Moon.
KR's player says he wants to leave the club-- "I've been in touch with some people in the B League."
Tobias Thomsen, KR's player in the Pepsi Max League, appears to be leaving the team.
According to Master Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
football.net also reported the case.
Tobias wants to get to the beginning of the season in his country, but for that, he has to cancel his contract with KR where the Danish department will begin before the Icelandic odds.
The Society knows I miss Danmerk and I've been very understanding, " Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
"I've been in touch with a few teams in the B League and will probably switch over before the Icelandic season ends.
There are not many teams in Denmark who can afford to pay off my contract with KR.
He then says that he likely has to take on a reduced salary in Denmark.
"Seconds in Denmark have probably felt more economic effects than in Iceland."
The Bjartmar Whirlm has found millions of wheels back - is now responding by DV coverage
For over a year, Birtmar Leósson has had a hobby unlike most others.
He sniffs out and saves lost, stolen bicycles, electric wheels, and vests.
As a result, Bjartmar has won the name "wheel whisperer. "
Yesterday, a man published a story about his dealings with Bjartmar.
Then refer DV to a discussion of the Facebook group of West Towns where it was said that Bjartmar took the man on Eastern fields and may have been stolen.
Couldn't have read from the original writer of the electric shuttle other than the Bjartmar's identity.
This text has now been changed on Facebook and the DV news headline has been updated accordingly.
Bjartmar tells of the original news of the case in no uncertain terms about what was actually going on yesterday on the East Field.
Birts said that they had received information from a victim of electric fights that they were certainly their electric shuttles.
The information received by an alleged owner, but the information was incorrectly stated by Birtmar.
"I saw the guy, and I recognized the shuttle, and I ended up with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missed for a very long time and was sought.
I certainly hesitated first, but when I saw him preparing to ride on the shuttle, I decided to punch the man.
The owner was sure of his fault, so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
Generally, I do very well this sort of thing, but before I finished what I had to say the man had taken from me the word."
Bjartar says that the man on the electric shuttle immediately invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and that he himself called the police.
"Yeah, cool," said Bjartmar, "let's get this straight."
Then, the owner of the electric shuttle proved possession of his electric shuttle and set off.
Later, just as a previous report reported, the right owner of the electric shuttle told his story on Facebook.
In a little over a year that Birtmar has practiced in this practice, he claims to be able to count the exchanges he encountered with people on one side of his fingers.
" I've had peaceful relations with the most difficult men in Reykjavík, " said Birtmar, pointing out that bicycle thieves are by far the least of the community's brothers and sisters, drug addicts, depressed people, and other people for some reason on the street.
"The disease is a tough master, and somehow the next dose has to be financed, unfortunately, theft of these funds is an easy way to reach that goal, " says Bjartmar.
"My dealings with these people are really so good that I have so many of the good people with me.
Some people have gone to treatment, and then they come to me, and they help me with what I am doing, " he says.
In general, Bjartmar's communication with bicycle people is polite.
Some know what he's doing and what he's offering, and they offer peacefully to show him receipts, license numbers of wheels, and so forth.
Bicycle theft is a major problem that has not been discussed.
Furthermore, Birtmar says that even the police have come to the point that they want to talk to him because of their stolen bicycles.
Bjarts disagree with previous DV news transfers and claims that they are not some sort of self - appointed police in a personal search for justice.
Asking whether he's not at the top of ice by his actions, and whether this is not the primary role of the police, Bjartmar certainly is.
"Of course the cops are supposed to do this, but the fact is, the cops are just not taking care of this.
I've been watching officers drive away from a pile of stolen wheels.
She's very, very demeaning in these matters. "
"When the cops aren't doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this group, then why not?" asks the Bjartmar.
He says that he was so successful in finding stolen wheels, that at times he found his "oppressors " on the street that they had only the righter wheels they had previously caught.
The times Bjartmar has called for police assistance have made it happen that she simply does not show up.
"It's just not working with the police, and it's not my fault, and it's not the owners of the bicycles,' said Bjartmar, and I'm sorry the victims of bicycle thieves have to suffer the emptiness of the police in this business.
The results of Bjartmar are not divided.
In many places, stories about people thank the Bjartmer that he has restored his belongings.
Bjarts, for example, have long lost the number on a number of bicycles he has given, but the amount is probably running on millions, if not millions.
Roads there, electric tubes, and electric shuttles are heavy, but electrical wheels can cost up to half a million.
Bjarts work during the day at school, and every other weekend he works at a farm.
Thus, his hard cycle search is an unpaid job he does in his spare time.
Pension funds and long shadows
In 2019 a birthday year was high in the history of a pension fund in Iceland.
Although officials had obtained pensions from King Dana all the streets since the 19th century, in 1919 a pension fund was established by officials who eventually became the pension fund of all public employees.
Then, in 1969, the foundation was laid for the current remuneration funds of public wages in total labour market agreements that laid on the job-related pension fund by an obligatory and valid collection from the beginning of 1970.
Then, in 1974, laws were passed on to these agreements, and the pension system continued to expand.
The pension system of paymen was not the only radical change the 20th - century labor movement brought on by its struggle.
In 1955, employment insurance had similarly come in a historical strike of conflict, and the organization gradually received its demand for sick and medical care, severe holiday rights, short work time, housing reforms, and so on.
All these rights cost a great and strict struggle, but they proved to be, after thinking, far more and more permanent than the increase in the pay layer, which went as hard as the inflation that marked the period after war and until 1990, as many people remember.
The lead to the establishment of a public pension fund in 1969 was both long and complex.
Although the funds would eventually be owned by funds, labor movements agreed that their governments should appoint representatives of the workers and treasurers alike.
In the years that followed the fund's agency, the demand for the majority of the fund's workers was often discussed in the labor unions, but it was never realized, so we still have an abnormal arrangement that representatives of our funds are not in the majority of the management of the funds.
In Article 36 of Article 129/1997, the obligation to cover the life insurance and the work of pensions is discussed on fund policy investments.
It states that "a fund of life should be guided by financial resources. "
Also stated in the 5th box: "A pension fund should set moral standards in investments. "
Among the stockholders' policy are the following provisions, followed by the laws mentioned above:
The Pension Fund is a member of the United Nations (UN PII) regulations for responsible investments, as well as many of the largest pensions and professional investors in the western and European seas.
The rules discuss how emphasis on environmental and social issues plus good management of enterprises can contribute to improved investments of the worst stock markets.
In this way, society's interests and goals are combined in a larger context.
LV considers it important that companies, especially those registered in the stock market, set up a public policy on: the implementation of a good administrative system of social and environmental responsibilities.
The wealth of pension, which has the largest funds in the country, has established "a policy of responsible investments, " and these are similar terms.
It's all referred to here as the introduction to the latest fashion term, "shade control. "
Because the word is new, there is no hope that it has been fully defined, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most taken ": Shadow control is when a public official in the union says in the media that he is sending talks or instructions on how to take sides in a particular matter.
If they do not follow the suggestion, they will be removed from the board at the first convenient time.
If the leader does not take this into the media and does not talk about enlightenment, however, it is not "a shadow control, " for, of course, there are many relationships between people in the financial world as well as elsewhere.
I leave it to the reader to think about which path he finds "more dark. "
In particular, there are two men who have tried to shape this definition when it is written, on Saturday morning, July 25, 2020.
It's Hörgisson, journalist of the News magazine and Ásgeir Jónsson.
The occasion for both was followed by the fact that Boggis Bogasson, president of the Icreandian Society's plan to break up our contracts with the stewardess and flight servants (designed to them), and Ragnar Thor Ingolfsson, president of the Reykjavíkian Trade Association, sent them out a reference to the Society in the management of the Penitentiary Fund, not to support the possible purchase of stocks in the company, or they may be replaced.
In time, Boggi Nil withdrew his decision, followed by Robert Thor, who, of course, focused on Bogs ' decision.
Nevertheless, they saw Hörg and Ásgeur's reasons for enforcing the subject in Friday's News magazine, making big comments about government, law, and the need for law changes.
There, though the blessed layer had been in the subjunctive, and it was rapidly wiped out, little you would surely have to roll down.
Since it is important to consider the matter in the end.
I used to track before the laws on the pension fund that depend on this matter.
This includes the management of funds and the moral standards of investments, and these factors are further developed in the approved terms of both the values and the Pension Fund, as mentioned.
However, money funds are not meant to look solely for short - term profites in investments.
Such a dangerous course would be very dangerous, and it would not take long to look for examples of this in the past, where large loans of banks and funds have slipped into immoral adventurers and environmental messes, with tragic consequences.
The director of the Iclandians was obviously on slippery ice when he thought of wiping out a whole group of employees, thus drawing a great deal of favor that the company has enjoyed in the Icelandic market and weakening its position toward investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time will tell if this is sufficient for society's investments in pensions to be considered responsible for society's funds.

One infected person did not use a return-aseptic technique
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday came to the country from the Baltic States on July 15 of the past, about one and a half weeks ago.
However, he is an Icelander who does not live here regularly, so he did not have clear instructions to use so - called aseptic techniques after arriving in the country and to have a second sample a few days after arrival.
He was negative from screening at the border.
"But he's in Icelandic society, and he's really supposed to go through it, " says Kamilla Josephsdótttir, an expert in the Center for Disease Control at the National Institute of Disease Control while he's on summer vacation, in a conversation with the News newspaper today.
"He used the English registration form and it's not an obligation to record the social security number, and if the social security number is not recorded, you are not automatically presented in the second sample."
She says that man could have used the English registration form because he's actually living abroad, but because of his name on the country he should have used in Iceland.
At least he didn't realize.
"When the Social Security is not registered, you need to seek it for yourself.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that this was the right way, " Kamilla says.
"So it is clear that, while we find some way to automation, we need to improve the information supply, even though Iceland does not record its social security number, we need to improve it.
Or doing it somehow more clearly who are participants in the Icelandic registry, it explains.
Happily, though, they did not get involved in the arrival of the country, although it is defined as a member of the Icelandic community, a member of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to the convalescents after he was diagnosed yesterday and were all associated with him.
They're going to take samples, but two of them are already showing signs of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative report from his vision at the border on July 15.
Kamilla is likely to say that he had recently been infected with the virus that she could not yet be found in him when the vision was taken to the border.
However, she does not want to rule out the spread of man's disease here in Iceland but does not carry the virus with her to the country.
"You can't quite claim that this is definitely a imported disease because it's a long time since he's been in the country that he might have been exonerated here like those two who've caused a little stake in connection with the sports events."
Yet, she says that it is most unlikely because of the few people around her.
"It's actually very unlikely," says Kamilla, but says that it cannot be excluded until the human viral sequence has been arranged by the Icelandic genetics.
"If we get a virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain he carried it to the country."
Pepper sprays and bombs used against Protestants
There was an incident between the police and the Protestants in Seattle last night.
Police used pepper sprayers and nonfatal grenades, but Protestants broke windows and set them on fire.
45 Protestants were arrested, and 21 officers were injured.
Police brutality and racism were widely objected in the United States last night, while the Seattle protests were to support Protestants in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protestor was shot dead.
As reported in the BBC, the assailant has been arrested.
In Seattle, thousands of people met in peaceful protests.
Then a group of people set fire to a building site and broke windows in the city's courthouse.
Later, police protested as a riot, and there was a conflict between Protestant and police groups.
Require justice in Aurora, Colorado, was Elijah McClain, a 23 - year - old black man who was murdered by a police officer last August, by the least of the Protestants.
A car drove through a group of Protestants in the city, but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black soldiers met and demanded justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26 - year - old black woman murdered by police in her home last March.
The group carried firearms and set up for close - up corners, where police assigned the group to the protesters who also carried firearms from the protesters.
At that time, 75 were arrested in Omaha, Nebraska, where Protestants remembered James Scurlock, a 22 - year - old black man murdered by a white bartender in May.
Solskær: Not the game which defines our time period
Ole Gunnar Solskjeakak, director of Manchester United, does not want to overstat the importance of the game with Leicester today during the final tour of the English elite department.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea won't lose against Wolves, end of Solskær and his men in fifth place, and thereby miss Masters' place.
However, they still had the hope of being assigned to the Master's Department by winning the European Department for the next month.
"We're not at the finish line yet.
If we make a point against Leicester, I think people will say we haven't had a bad season,' said Soldeak.
"But whatever happens, this isn't the end of our journey because we still have a lot of land to catch the two of us up," said Solskjörk.
Clearly, at 15 today the nerves are swollen, but the Solskær tried to act as if there were any other games involved.
"If you want to belong to Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It's not new, and it's based on the club.
We've made a great opportunity to end the period well, and now it's our job to take advantage of it," said Solskær.
"This isn't the most important game of the season, it's just the next game.
You can ask anybody in the football game. The next game is always the most important.
The outcome doesn't define our time, we've already had many hours to define this period. "
"Mr. Bruno Fernides made a big difference for us, and I believe that a brain over us is in better shape and much stronger spiritually than during the last period," said Solskær.
65,000 virus per day
In the United States, 65,490 newly infected Korean virus was diagnosed yesterday, according to the University of John Hopkins.
Overall, 4,178,021 infections from the beginning of the epidemic have been confirmed in the western ocean.
900 deaths were caused by the virus last four days until the virus was more than 1,000 per day.
Overall, 146,460 deaths due to the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
CNN reports that according to a model of U.S. disease control authorities, the number of deaths due to the virus will be 175,000 on August 15 next.
Fearing another wave of the epidemic
Spain's government is now trying to hold back the growth of CVID - 19 in the country.
The Spanish medical authorities reported over 920 new cases of COVAD - 19, both Thursday and Friday.
There have been no more than 24 hours since the beginning of May and when the news begins, as Spanish start to defuse one of Europe's strictest exits.
The background led to British authorities now obliging passengers who come from Spain to go for an entourage during their return.
A week earlier Spain was in the British list of secure kingdoms.
The situation in Catalonia, northeastern Spain, is one of the worst, where governments have taken greater restrictions to try to stop the growth.
In the capital city of Barcelona, dance clubs will be shut down for the next two weeks, and waves will be shut down at midnight.
There is now a curfew for 200 thousand inhabitants of Segria County in western Catalonia.
It is thought that the British decision will have a negative effect on the Spanish economy, which is very angry at the arrival of foreign tourists and is badly worthy of the pandemic.
Tui, the largest traveling office in Britain, announced all the flights planned today for Spain and the Canary Islands.
The governments around the world are said to prepare for the second wave of the epidemic, but there seems to be little interest in again resorting to extensive curfews that have destroyed the economy in many places.
For instance, Boris Johnson, prime minister of the British, has dealt with such problems as nuclear weapons that he does not wish to use.
Then, the French prime minister Jean Castex has said that if a national curfew was again taken, the nation "would not survive, economic or social. "
Many counselors hope to have the local resources that will reach the inhabitants of individual towns, cities, or regions will be sufficient to keep the virus back in the next pass if possible.
Five New Transmissions in Iceland - Three Homelands
Three internal infections were detected yesterday, plus two others at the border.
Thus five positive Covid-19 individuals were identified yesterday in Iceland.
According to a public defense report, one of the infections is related to the transmission reported yesterday at the ReyCUP soccer tournament.
Has he been sent to solitary confinement, and sixteen who were close to him in a district of infection?
The person who was infected was involved in a sports club in Reykjavík and is according to the report, "only in the sports team " in an environment.
Others who were sent under a contagion relate to man in another way.
The origin of this infectious process is unfounded, and the transmission is in full effect by a U.S. Marshal's infectious team.
ReyCUP conventions have followed the instructions and guidelines of a psychiatrist and of the public defences still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, the films of the convention last night attracted attention, as one of the most intimate members of the convention was to celebrate their fine gangs on the field.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the following notifications of their Facebook page match.
It says: "TH: Parents, please respect the rules that contestants themselves attend their toys at school.
Parents are NOT permitted to do so.
Thank you for your demonstration.
Another infection was detected yesterday, but is associated with the transmission reported yesterday.
The report states: "Iasak genetic analysis has determined the infection and has identified a new type of virus that has not been identified here before. "
It is also infested with infectious agents and infected with isolation and 12 with contaminating diseases.
The third transmission is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15th.
He was detected in the southwestern corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement, and six were in close association with him in a district of infection.
Two of them are already showing signs of virus infection.
In addition, two were identified at the border, and they are waiting for a further investigation, such as a crossborder process.
Finally, the announcement states: The Federal Police Department and the surgeon general's office are warning people to take care and take good care of individual transmissions.
In any case, if the symptoms of the Covid-19 virus are present, the same person is asked to take a sample at the nearest clinic.
Patrekfjörður reports on shopping weekends - Directing Visitors Another
This weekend, according to the announcement of the West, the branch of Patrekærd has been booked.
When visiting guests, they are advised to consider other accommodations.
The names of the West-Europe of Bildudal, Tribal Fjord, Melanes of the Red Sea, Hotel Flandalund, and Hotel Breiðavík as an alternative option for the situation.
There's plenty to be in Patrekund this weekend, because as before, the city's Bank City, the holiday celebration of Icelandic documentary films is going to be held.
It has been held since 2007 and has become a strong tradition in town.
An application to the tent area can be expected to arrive well this year, if the weather does not cut into account, but the DV said earlier than today it did.
But the worst weather can be expected south, and the hope for the Patrecks.
The web ib.is first reported, saying that all other beds in town were already booked.
Whole apartment building goes down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free at Dunkara 18-20.
While owners seek a reimbursement permit, their information has gone around in the system for the third year.
In one of Reykjavík's oldest, most expensive, and natural neighborhoods, there is a beautiful condo on three levels.
The building's on the ground floor has about 6 square feet [600 square m] of traffic.
At the back of the house are the doors of two stairways, each containing four somewhat noble apartments.
These range from 93 to 30 square metres, however most of them exceed 100.
The house has quite a story.
It was built in 1959 and has included hosting video stores, the shoe shop, the Lax Sama's milk shop, Jóa gunsmith, fishing sales, and now the last high school printer.
The house has, to put it mildly, her luxury is fairer.
The house is now under severe damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are based on a company file including Magnússon and Guðrún Helga Lárrusdóttir.
Michael went to the owner's group oforgers and was the president of the Cities Association for Remuneration.
Remuneration is made up of the owners of the holding society, steel ships ehf.
Ehf's steel ship is the Guðnar Helgu Lárusdóttir and her children's investment partner.
Gudrún is also the owner of a third part of D18 ehf.
Guðrún and her husband, Augustus Guðmundur Sigurðsson, once fired the ship of steel.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009, so there has been little or nothing left to keep from then on.
Tell neighbors that the house's condition has been getting worse constantly since, though, in recent years.
On Facebook, one neighbor in the neighborhood says that the house "was not particularly lively in recent years. "
This may include several years of seeking to change the house and the property.
Other neighbors say the house was a long time ago.
"It's a long time to do something nice about this spot and boring that it was dragged like this."
He also says that he is upset at the owners of his house for not having moved on to finish this, to find some common surface with the neighbors of his house, and to stop that "lawstorm. "
"Just do it together with the society around you so you can get on with it and finish it."
The "System of Law" designed to refer to is the structure of the field that has been going on at least since 2017.
Then Dunhagha 18 and 20 owners were sent to build an altitude on the current apartment building and behind the house, a new elevator house, and a one - floor building as well as a basement.
The building permit provided for this project was reported to the Environmental and Resource Management Committee and eliminated it from the Commission because the implementation was not supported by shared organization and localisation was inadequate.
Reykjavíkurborg then started a shared organization and finished with an advertisement in the issue of Government in July last year.
That organization was also charged with bringing this committee out of operation in March 2020.
At this point, therefore, nearly three years had passed since the original construction application and the owner of the house were at the beginning.
At that time, the house had recededed considerably, and neighbors began to tire out.
When DV asked the neighbor of the house about the situation and the response of neighbors, the answers were in many ways.
Some had an understanding of the plans of the house owners, others not at all.
Others focused their anger on the city; others didn't.
Others were just angry, but not necessarily with anyone.
Still others said the parking lot was scrambled, but neighbors have new unused parking lot Dunhags 18-20 under their vehicles.
One accuser in the case said that he was so tired of administrative:
"That we'll have to go through the process in three places is absolutely incredible.
It's as if Reykjavíkurburg did not know how to read. "
Today, the house is empty, abandoned, and neglected.
A monument to the city's hovering administration and its noble plans for the owner and the many years' work of those who are now starting.
When a reporter arrived in Dunhaka 18, he was struck with open doors and garbage heaps.
Playstation computer and modern television were all around the earth - the victims of Icelandic summer diapers.
The old college printer's office was opened, and there were quite a few cats who could smell their piss.
Clearly, someone's nested in one corner and no one has seen it.
Cods and beds and several boards of geology pages that were likely to become a book were crumbling.
The building's stairways were also open and alive in both.
A journalist was so lucky to meet one of them.
They were over there eating potatoes and invited in by a journalist.
The Romanians work for the staff rent Ztrongforce ehf.
They've been there for some time, and they've seen DV's sources say that the company paid nothing for the building but heat and electricity.
Because of the condition of the house, it is not acceptable to collect rent.
From the letters given in the lobby of the house, it is clear that there have been some number of foreign workers in the past years.
The leading labour sector has not been part of the Covid-19 situation, the end of travel recession, and the two businesses have been the most efficient people to use the services of workers in the construction sector.
Nevertheless, at Dunhaka 18 it seemed that after long hours in the rain, the house members had enough work to do and hang their work suits and migrating mits.
It should be noted that in spite of the terrible state of the house, the apartment the boys shared seemed pretty well maintained.
When a journalist reported to the local boys, he suddenly became cynical: At the best spot in Reykjavík, a 1,500 - square - square - foot [1,500 m] property is down.
Owners want to change the house for the better, and neighbors want to make things better but debate about the definition of "better. "
Between them, the city's planning field sits at the beginning, the victim of an endless appeal route, and the potential for concern in the planning process and the solution to environmental and resource services by hoverers.
The house then has Romanian workers, perhaps even those who are about to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop arguing.
The opening article appeared in the July 17 weekend issue of DV.
Anti-transtrogenic overweight
The prime minister of Britain, Boris Johnson, will give 10 million pounds in a campaign against overweight, which will include the prohibition of fast food advertisements, following a serious illness, in part because of his weight.
Johnson's introduction to the campaign promised better health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to check bicycle riding for their clients in overweight and will also be under attack on the growth of bicyclists.
Then, according to British media sources, advertisements of fast - food stations on TV will be banned by 21 p.m.
" COVAD - 19 has provoked us to the short and long - term risks of being overweight, and the prime minister is determined that we must use our time to improve health, to work, and to eat a more healthful diet," according to government spokesman.
Johnson has personally had weight problems, but he was put in a intensive care unit when he was infected with the crown virus during spring, and is partly to his weight because of what he is supposed to have become so gravely ill.
Women Better to Lead the Change
She said that the new constitution is the largest step the nation can take toward greater power distribution, transparency, and combating corruption and the interests of the whole.
"We must begin to change a bit now and who is better able to lead such a change than the community that is easier to be in these values.
There are women," said Helga.
"A woman in Iceland is famous for her ladyhood.
To stand together and be together to lead a change.
So now it's our turn to lead these changes.
She said she was a little nervous over the emphasis on Iceland as "best in the world" in both sex and human rights.
"Then we are not as ready to see what must be done.
Like the Germans, they are very aware of their history and look at all that needs to be done.
It's a lot.
We need to know where we're coming from, knowing the story and listening.
Listen to the voices of peripheral groups.
We don't all live under the same rules here, said Helga.
When asked, she said that women are in many good shapes in Iceland, but she added that as in many other parts of Iceland, the situation was extremely male.
She said that politics became the product of self - interest, authority, and power, which were the forces that maintained discrimination in all societies.
"Women have formed this group and come together, and have become just a little bit frustrated that the General Assembly is going to run out of this 2012 national fee," she said.
"There are these feminine values that we're thinking this out of.
From human rights and nature protection, cooperation, and the fact that we're all actually sitting at the same table, she said, adding that the above values are the baseline values in the new constitution.
"We are a very rich country of naturalism, and it's ridiculous that there are people living in poverty.
It's ridiculous, we can change different," said Helga.
"It's absurd that there's something natural that women's work is always a little lower.
It's ridiculous that flight attendants and nurses will have to stand constantly in a struggle just to earn a decent salary. "

Tried to rob a walker downtown
A man was arrested in downtown last night after threatening the pedestrians and trying to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in Alttown, where two were arrested for the case.
Then the police stopped the motorbike driver in the Hives, where his driver was at a speed of 146 miles per hour, with a maximum speed of 60 miles per hour.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of driver's rights.
Police in the capital area had enough work to do last night and had more than 80 cases written in police diary from five to five this morning.
At that time, noise announcements were especially intense because of consistent reports.
On Saturday's leaving, 11 loud parties received announcements and were impressed by the police diary.
Last night, however, 22 noises on the police table.
Six were saved in a prison cell last night.
In the New Year's Eve, police were called in for tonight's launching of fireworks.
Yet, they had escaped when a policeman arrived.
At that time, nine drivers were stopped for drunk and drug driving.
Four were arrested for fighting downtown last night, but one of them was saved in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to the emergency room after they fell on the face, one in the downtown town, and the other in the West Side.

In addition, police officers stopped a driver who drew a trailer on Kjalarnes yesterday.
The trailer's wheeling equipment, according to the police diary, was in a "very bad situation, " and it remained still.
You can stay in Monet's house for shopping weekend
The house in which impressionist Claude Monet spent the last 40 years of his practice is now renting the site Airbnb.
The next available night in the house is the mall weekend.
The house is small and adorable, located in the town of Givenry, Normandie, France.
The world - famous painter lived in the house since 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms, and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If someone is to rent the house, he has to rent at least two nights.
Based on the page of the Airbnb, it is next available after a week, on the Sunday store hall, and thus it might be the perfect choice for some storekeepers on vacation to hurry to book the painter's house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend cost only 964 U.S. dollars, or just over $ 130,000, according to what the News News reports next learns.
Tens of them are contaminating, and some are showing the signs of the disease caused by the Korean virus.
During the past three days, five people have been identified with the local crown virus, most of which are unplugged.
Because of these conditions, dozens of them begin to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were identified with the local crown virus yesterday and two by the border screening.
An expert at the surgeon's office says that a growing number of internalised people do not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading more widely into society.
"There's been a sequencing of the previous domestic infection, and there's a virus that hasn't been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to think it's been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something that has just arrived to the country, but of course we need to be very careful now, " said Kamilla Sigmir, the daughter of Joseph, an expert on the social defense field of a surgeon.
Most of them have been infected with individuals from abroad.
More samples are being made in the near future than some who were associating with the infected are showing signs of the crown virus.
"Now there is no intraflutrens in action and less on other respiratory infections, so we can be quite liberal in doing these tests on individuals who at in influenza time would have felt a reason to do something else first," said Kamilla.
It is largely completed, but it is not excluded that more people will be infected.
After attending sporting events, two of the infected were diagnosed.
Has it raised questions about whether such an event is possible to maintain.
The public defence director puts it very slowly, as long as people adhere to standards and rules.
Kamilla says that at the sports events, it is virtually impossible for infected ones to get infected.
"If there aren't more in isolation from these people after associating with them at these events, we can argue that our conventions have worked.
"But it's not clear," said Kamilla.
The P.R. Work is under constant review.
"We must be ready to interrupt with further advice or limitations if there seems to be occasion," said Kamilla.
After more than a week, the number of restrictions is set aside to make room for a thousand.
This new situation could affect the outcome.
"A certain idea of cooking" - Look at the menu for Elisa Vidar
Consider the experience of Elisha the Vidar's daughter.
She is also a Master of nutrition, mother, and a food scholar.
She needs a lot of energy for the day's hard work and usually takes time to prepare good and nutritious food.
"My usual day starts by coming to work at eight," says Elisha.
"After work, I go to the store to be able to prepare dinner before I pick up my girl at the nursery at about three o'clock."
Elisa finds that attending her daughter early in her nursery is a source of nourishment.
"It's good to have time with her before I go to practice the second bit.
After practice, it's good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
At night, when the girl is asleep, we like to watch one factor emptying the mind. "
Elisha does not follow any particular diet.
She is finishing her work, school, family, and exercise, as a result, knows what is appropriate for her to eat.
"What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well combined with proteins, carbohydrates and fat.
But most important to me is having a healthy relationship with food, not sorting foods to a bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
You see, it's all right to eat everything, just not all of a sudden and not always."
Elisha is very interested in cooking.
"I think a certain idea of standing in the kitchen to cook and getting it very much into it.
I have to say, my confidence is in the kitchen, and I really believe I'm a good cook.
Breakfast: oats, chia-seeds, hammer seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, leave in almond milk over the night.
Then press this meal with each meal.
Most often it is a banana and a muse & KAFFI.
I'm a big coffee lady.
Interpretation: Amazingly different, fruits or vegetables, crabs, clean jars with bananas and mouses, bread with coats on it, and then I could eat hummus with a spoon out of a box, if that is the case.
Lunch: I often make myself a variety of high-food salads from what is available in the refrigerator, china, or barley, falapels, rock salad, high-funded vegetables with fine dress is a bit of what I'm working on.
If the organization gets totally out of control (which happens often), then the egg machine at work has helped me pretty often, and that's 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese, and boiled eggs, that's all you've got.
Interpretation: Get me something rich in carbohydrate before exercise, bread with sticks, cereals, or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be chosen very often in my home, or some delicious vegetables.
A Conflict Between Police and Protestant in Seattle
The city of Seattle, Washington, has declared a state of rebellion following a large protest in the middle of the city.
Police yesterday used a flash bomb and a pepper spray to try to clear out a large area that was conquered by Protestants and stretched over many blocks near the city's Assembly Hall.
The police reported on Twitter that at least 11 Protestants had been arrested and that there was an investigation of vandalism at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
National and police authorities say that Protestants stoned police with rocks, bottles, boom bombs, and other loose devices, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where his injuries were done.
The protest in Seattle, however, remained peaceful for a long time off.
They were called upon to demonstrate harmony to the Protestants in Portland, Oregon, where the city has repeatedly established a bitter conflict between Protestants and the heavy - armed federal forces of the FBI.
There, like other U.S. cities, people gather under the mark of Black Lives Matter, remembers George Floyds, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis on May 25, protests of systematic rasism in the United States, and demands reforms.
Not undone until due to vote
It is currently unknown whether the reports of the stewardesses to take effect at the end of the next month will be canceled.
The general vote for the Icelandic stewardship contract for the stewardess Society for the stewardess of Iclanders ends at noon tomorrow.
The god - god of Liney Jonsdóttir, president of the club, expressed confidence that Icelanda will not make the decision about the resignations until the votes are passed.
"This is really hanging together," says the Godly pool of Liney.
"There have no resolutions have been canceled; this must be going to lie so that the machines can be humanized.
Of course, people are anxious to know if they will be working after the month's convention. "
The campaign is about a contract signed a week ago, on the night of July 19th.
It is expected to be in force until the end of September 2025 and based on a contract that the stewardess had previously taken in votes.
On July 17, the board of directors and confidentiality of Iceland's stewardships agreed to a full - time work stop at Iclanders, which was adopted by members in votes.
It never came to her, but it was decided after Ikelanda's decision to call off a discussion with the stewardess Society, resigning all of her flight attendants, and looking for contracts with another union.
Then the pilots of the airline were to take on the task of a series of criminals on board a temporary ship.
Ask her how she feels that the vote will go on, says Gullava Liney.
"People feel hurt after this attack by the Illelands, when all the stewardess of the club were dumped and announced that they would be on another trade.
Now it becomes clear if it has an effect, " she says.
940 flight attendants worked for Icelanders at the end of April when 900 were, about 95%, quit.
Their appointment is variable, with three months of employment, and is finished at July August.
This includes about 90% of the flight attendants of Icelanda.
What's the deal against the deal?
"Then we wish for a continued discussion with our clients.
With this deal, we're meeting Icelanda's demand.
If he is rejected, it is apparent that the stewardess have been overstepped. "
The vote for a collective agreement is over and Icellands presents tomorrow's quarterly allowance.
The stewardess' vote for a new dress contract ends at 12 noon tomorrow.
The preparation of the second quarter of a year will also be published tomorrow, but preliminary results indicate that the company's income dropped by 85 percent from the same period last year.
An electronic vote on the Icelandic Flavour Society and the Icland Society's Association started on Wednesday, July 22, and ends tomorrow, Monday, July 27, 12 at noon.
Those who are allowed to vote for the contract are the Icelanda employees who are paying dues to the stewardess' company.
Icelands and the FFI signed a new dress contract on Sunday, July 19, but Friday, Icelands had broken up the discussion with the Society after the flightes broke a previous vote at the beginning of July.
By then, Iclanders had told all the flight attendants and flight teams of the company on Friday, but they were retracted after the new crew contract was signed.
According to a new agreement, flight attendants have to fly five hours more per month for the same basic wage.
The contract has to do with the year 2025, where pilots and flight attendants have been integrated on a single watch for how long to fly.
The contract was presented to members of the FFI at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica Hotel last Monday and declared a number of flight attendants who spoke to a news agency about their dissatisfaction over the agreement.
Most seemed to agree, however, that the contract had to be agreed to keep the FFI alive.
Tomorrow, IcLanda's budget will be presented tomorrow to the EBIT Corporation, its management income and taxes, according to preliminary data negative between 100 and 110 million U.S. dollars, or some 15 billion dollars.
Last Wednesday, Icelands sent temporary bills to the Wall Streets, saying that the company's income was about $60 million at a quarter of $3.3 billion.
At the end of the quarter, there have been about 154 million dollars of U.S. dollars, about $2 billion.
Icelanders also aim to offer the company's parts in August.
Icelanders are going to finish contracts with 15 creditors, the government and Boing the aircraft manufacturer by the end of a month before the stock market is scheduled.
New variants rather than new viral
"New virus just means that it's been an individual who came from abroad.
It's not something that's been cooking up in the country, " says Maor Kristjánsson, director of the Transmissible Disease Department of the Land Hospital, reports that "a new type of virus " has been detected here.
Three internal infections were detected yesterday and two were detected at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the social activities of a sports club at the Rey Cup soccer tournament, the origin of unfounded infectious agents.
Also detected in a person who came to the country on July 15 and who had two contacts with him began showing the symptoms of COVAD - 19.
There was a diagnosis of infection in yesterday related to previous exposure, and after a diagnostic analysis by the Icelandic genotype, "a new type of virus that has not been identified here was found. "
Transmission is complete in association with the presence of infection.
Mon says that the virus is not a new virus but is the same virus that has spread around the world, i.e. the new Korean virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more correct to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new virus.
Asking what that population is and whether it could say something about the start of another epidemic, Mon says that there is a single incident, and it might not be any more.
"But if there are events in the country that do not have a link abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, you could draw that conclusion [about the second wave], but it's premature at this time," explains Maur.
Good heavens in the hot tub
Is the secret to the happiness of Icelanders hiding in the hot tubs?
BBC day-to-day artists are leading to a similar pattern in a fun video that sheds light on the nation's swimming pools and hotpots.
The Icelandic bath culture is globally special, and it is claimed that no one in the world is ever asked for as many people.
It is the basis of the natural flesh, but it is also the custom of swimming that prevails here.
Children's breakdown was legalized in 1940, but older citizens are no less diligent in using hot water for their health.
Dizziness is described as a permanent part of the general well - being of the country.
In the hot tub, everyone's equal, regardless of rank or rank.
Free of cell phones, people discuss home and space with one another, or they enjoy the fused power of water: their minds and bodies are loaded down.
He's got a hard-on to pick up a hundred days in an election
One hundred days there are until the Americans enter the election and select a four-year President.
Donald Trump is looking for reelection, but he's supposed to pick it up.
Joe Biden, prospective candidate for the Dartera Party, has a national lead, taking into consideration surveys.
According to an AP poll, the U.S. record estimates that the nation is on the wrong track.
Similarly, Trump's response to the pandemic of the new Korean virus is very unpopular, and more Americans than before think that the president has kept the economy under poor control.
To be precise, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent claim that Trump's response to the epidemic was supported, and 48 percent reported that he kept the economy well under control.
It was 56 percent in March, and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the FiveThirteenEight mean, the Biden has 49.9 percent national, while Trump is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to shift his attention from the epidemic's performance to the Bden, to promote so - called cultural conflicts, and to promote policy issues that are to be governed by law and order.
However, the Biden campaign is a great effort to keep the attention of Trump, and it is highly likely to win if the vote is actually about how Trump has performed in the last four years.
Unsurpassed Trump also seems to aim to bring down members of the Republican Party and to fear the Apostles that the Darals could reach even the majority of the U.S. Senate senators, who have so far fallen.
Politico reported during the days to continue following classes and candidates comparable, and today the Republican Party would have its greatest success in decades.
Substitution has been particularly bad during the 2016 election, and it is now designed to continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare the people of the suburbs to follow him, including saying that if he becomes President Bden, he will destroy the suburbs of the United States and promote racial strife.
Among other things, Trump has canceled regulations from the time of Barack Obama in the White House designed to increase the variety of suburbs.
He then urged the "housewives " of the United States ' suburb to read an article by former vice president of New York, claiming that Biden would destroy the suburbs of the United States and agree with Trump.
"Biden will destroy your neighborhood and your American dream.
I'll keep it, and even make it even better!" said the president.
The people of the suburbs of the United States are growing among voters.
According to NPR, there are about half of all voters in the United States.
Ever since George W. Bush was reelected in 2004, the candidate who has received the majority of the votes of this group has become president.
Except in 2012, when Mitor Romney received the majority vote from this group but lost to Barack Obama.
Opinions have shown that despite the fact that the majority of the world's suburbs in 2016 have been closely attached to Trump.
Although there are differences between studies, Biden has shown a 15-point advantage over Trump in the outposts lately.
Regis Philbin is dead
U.S. television broadcaster Regis Philbin is dead at 88 years of age.
Philbin served as an actor, a spirit director, host, and singer for some six decades.
He is one of the most famous for directing the popular chat shows Live! With Regis between 1988 and 2011, with Kathie Lee Gifford and later with Kelly Ripa.
Then he's directed factors like Who Who Wants to be a Millionire and America's Got Talent.
According to Guinness World Records, Philbin is the person who has spent most of the hours on American television and has been recognized by that subject.
He won six Emmy's salary in his life and was graded, overall, 37 times.

Will the Olympic fire be light at the end of the tunnel?
After the final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, events that only world wars have advanced so far, the president of the World Olympic Committee stated that the famous Olympic fire would be "the light at the end of the tunnel " and that it was likely to refer to a global season of Korean virus that is now being carried through.
Many more have been able to prepare themselves for this year, and the cost of the delay is improved by the superior authorities in Japan.
Everyone, though, keeps their heads to a high level.
When Tokyo was announced to be the scene of the Olympic Games this year, the Japanese representatives were truly rejoicing.
They wept and laughed, for Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 games, but it bowed down to Rio, Brazil.
This time Tokyo and Japan would bathe in the attention of the world.
The games were to be held on July 24 to August 9, but they have been postponed for a year, starting on July 23, 2021, and ending August 8.
If the Korean virus remains too dangerous, the games will be canceled.
No one, however, wants to think that through.
Olympics are no ordinary sports competition.
There's nothing saved up, the show should always be wonderful and seek to top the last game.
The choice of a city for an Olympic game is based on the judgment of a selection committee on the public introductions of the city.
The more brilliant the presentation is - the greater the likelihood of getting the prize.
Tokyo spent $250 million in an effort to keep the 2016 Olympic Games, or a total of over $200 billion.
The second time, when the game was applied in 2020, there were $75 million, about $100 billion, for the presentation.
In 2013, when Tokyo was decided to receive the game this year, Japanese authorities already spent $30 billion on the project.
But this amount is just a drop in the ocean, considering how much it costs to build an Olympic village, stadiums, and in general to strengthen the interior to manage these conventions, prepare them, and keep their own games.
" The Tokyo Olympic Games, which should have been going on these days, have been postponed for about one year because of the crown virus, would have cost 12.6 billion dollars.
However, a report published at the end of the last year by a government accountant in Japan revealed that the cost was nearly twice that number.
The cost of postponing the games may not be fully evaluated, but it has been estimated that it may cost from two to six billion dollars in addition to its original cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers may therefore run from 15 to 30 billion dollars.
There are so many figures that at the lowest possible cost, all the taxes in the United States represented only about half of the Olympics.
Olympic Games are an event of the order of magnitude that they have become a subject for economists, who try to look into numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In the shortest case, it seems that quite a few have concluded that the influence of the Olympic Games is less than positive for the economy of the cities that keep them.
The short - term effects are some, for example, a growing number of long - term jobs.
Rio, Brazil, is stuck with a huge debt over the 2016 games and has been having trouble spending money on all the big sports activities built for the games.
In London of 2012, statistics have revealed that only 10 percent of those who got jobs in the city's Olympic Games had no prior job.
This means that there was only a small amount of new jobs.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in maintaining Olympics because of the low cost of mening the game.
The benefits, however, are often thought to be an increase in the traffic of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the games, which still have a strong uncertainty about the 2021 games.
It is also unclear if the number of viewers usually to attend will be received.
However, the main thing is the credit to the cities, but it is difficult to appreciate money.
Thus, in spite of enormous costs, the joys the games bring are not necessarily valuable.
Of course, it's not just money.
It's the sports heroes that are in the foreground.
For some accomplishments, it is hardly welcome to postpone the games.
For example, the Australian five-year-old girl and the gold winner in her article at the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is pregnant and would have been far from having fun for the summer, but there is no hope of being in the race for the games 2021.
So it is among athletes who are rather pleased with the procrastination, for understandable reasons.
For the athletes who planned to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, in some case, meant that they would quit before the games.
Just do not trust your body to go through another year of strict exercise.
Few athletes were as good at the audience at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games as the finder of Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has attended several interviews in her country of the United States recently to discuss the Olympic Games.
She's going to play 2021, but she's not necessarily sure she'll still be at the top of the game next year, and she'll be 24 years old.
While it is generally not considered to be advanced age, it is higher for a top actress.
"This is a delicate matter," says Biles, but smiling at another interview published on the Instantgram website of the Olympics asked whether she intends to reach as far as she can at the 2021 games as she did in Rio 2016.
"I just don't know if I'll still be at the top after another year of practice," says Biles.
She has previously spoken of her body's inability to cope with the pressures of handout training for a long time.
Nevertheless, she is an athlete for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was unpleasant to have to stop suddenly practicing when the pandemic was at its height and the findroom was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles as well as for others while all the athletes were shut down for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic gold could buy no access beyond the others; she had to find ways to stay in shape like others.
Yes, the basic form is a little better than most people.
"We have a stiff plan now.
It was difficult to start practicing first again after the findroom opened.
We started slowly, but we're back on track, and I'm going to keep up with my workouts as the year goes by.
Of course, we do not know exactly how these games will be, or whether they will be held, but we practice, considering that they will be, all we can do is.
I've worked too hard to leave the sport now, says Biles.
With her, like others, dozes or perhaps become more conscious that the games will not be held at all 2021 but will come true.
Predicting that, however, is hopeless.
No one can know what the situation in the pandemic of the Korean virus will be like in July 2021 and nothing but preparing for the Olympic Games as a year.
Maybe the Olympic fire will be the light at the end of the Covid tunnel.
Delayed wedding from an outbreak
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding because of the crown virus.
She was to marry the ex-Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
"I think there are other more important things to think about right now," said the actress in a conversation with People.
"We would love to get married sometime and have our dream wedding and all those who care about us.
But we decided to delay it and focus on what is important right now, and this is to help share information on the importance of wearing masks and staying at home.
I look to world affairs more than weddings these days.
There are many things going on, and we are to focus on what is happening in the world. "
