How long have these symptoms been?
and all chest pains should be treated in this way especially at your age
and with fever
and must also examine your cholesterol pressure
and do you have a fever now?
and do you have chest pains now?
and besides that you have difficulty breathing
and can you tell me what other symptoms you have at the same time?
and how high your fever is
and I also have a cough
and I had a little cold and cough
and I really have bad chest pain now
and is this the right time for your hay fever
and it got chest pain
and I think I have a little fever
and I want you to describe where chest pain is
and they also develop fevers
and your history of diabetes
and you know I'm going to collapse
and you know people always get to know me
and you have chest pains
and said it's pressure on your chest
Has anyone in the family had heart disease problems with heart attack of high blood pressure
Have you noticed any other symptoms or problems accompanying muscle pains?
Are there other sick people like you at home who have symptoms similar to your own?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Do you have any shortness of breath?
Do you still have chest pains?
Because today's flu season
but also should we not set aside chest pain from the cardiac heart
but a more important problem today is the pain of this chest
but I found it difficult to breathe
but I knew that many people had picked me up
but we need to treat each chest pain with the utmost seriousness
But now you're breathing well, right?
due to this chest pain I completely forgot
Does it feel as if someone is hitting your chest
Still feeling short of breath
Do they complain that they have a disease with similar symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic or chronic illness, such as high blood pressure or anything like before?
Do you have any other chronic medical problems such as diabetes?
Do you have any shortness of breath along with that chest pain?
Do you have high blood pressure?
Do you have shortness of breath at the same time?
Do you know what symptoms he has?
Can you see the picture?
Drink plenty of fluids now
but I took tests for diabetes
Yet she has symptoms similar to mine
How high is your fever?
What about your blood pressure?
if you continue to develop high fevers
if you have a fever of a hundred and two or higher
if you feel that your symptoms or problems require a closer look
I had a fever yesterday
I also had some fever
I had a fever yesterday
I have severe chest pain here
I also had difficulty breathing
I'll send you a picture
I have chest pains now
I only suffer a little headache and fever now
I think it's flu
I think it's a mild flu
Is there a heavy, heavy person sitting on your chest?
All began with headaches and fever about the same time
Pain in the middle of my heart
It is a chest pain that appears to be under pressure
It was in my chest
it was in the middle of my heart
It is in the middle of the chest
I had chest pains
I am very concerned about this chest pain
I want you to tell me in describing this chest pain
such as high blood pressure or diabetes
as in the middle of the chest
now for fever you can take tachipirina sweet
now you have symptoms for days
now you say that you have chest pains
from time to time I have chest pains
oh you have any other symptoms accompanying it besides just hurting
or someone sitting in your chest?
About the same time, there are fevers and coughs and muscle pains
right in the middle of my heart
Show me this picture where you feel the pain
Because you have a fever
Do you think that some of these symptoms may be related to pregnancy?
your children have several similar symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain
Night fever rises
I had two days of fever
Last night fever began to rise
this was doctor porter at the emergency room triage center
can you tell me a little more about your chest pain?
I feel pain in front of my body here in my chest
I had severe chest pains
when I have that chest pain
What kind of pain do you feel in your chest?
When did this chest pain begin?
Does the band hurt your chest?
where you feel this chest pain
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by your chest
You know I have diabetes and so forth
you say you have a chest pain.
The combination of coronavirus (COVID-19) disease in the European Union/European Economic Area and United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The combined incidents of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases show the same goals in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom that prove that, while at another stage depending on the country, there is rapid progress in all countries in the scores of COVID-19.
Based on experience from Italy, countries, hospitals and units of intensive care should increase their preparedness for the influx of COVID-19 patients that will require health care, and intensive care.
In 31 December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases unknown in the field of anetiology was reported in Wanan, Hubei Province, China.
In 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Because, the disease that has been called coronavirus (COVID-19) disease from the impestion of SARS-CoV-2 was named coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is ca 80% of indibidals with COVID-19 who suffer from a mild illness, that is, an application to the respiratory tract containing or without pneumonia, and most of these recover.
In ca 14% of cases, COVID-19 is becoming a more serious hospital disorder as the remaining 6% of cases experience a critical disease requiring intensive care.
The death of hospitalized patients from COVID-19 was ca 4%.
In this study, we counted the trainds on the combined occurrence of COVID-19 for every European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) country and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them to those in Hubei Province, China.
Let's also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 with the countries of the EU/EA in Italy on 31 January-15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in countries of EU/EA and UK
Following China, COVID-19 underwent additional geographical distribution and the dynamic of the COVID-19 in other parts of the world currently followed this country.
In 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveilance 2020 in 5 March, Spiteri et al reported on the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed Europe as defined by WHO in the case.
In the EU/EA, the first three confirmed cases were reported in France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wanan, Hubei Province, China.
Up to 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were identified in all 30 countries in the EU/EA and United Kingdom (UK), where between 31 December 2019 and including that date, 39,768 cases and 1,7777 deaths were reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting a combined number and combination of COVID-19 cases
At the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the declared case of COVID-19 in every country around the world, obtained only from such official sources as the Ministry of Health of nations, national and regional health authority and WHO, was taken each day at 8:00 in the morning.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 goals in the EU/EA and UK, and to compare them with Italy.
As a representative of the spread of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated 14 days of amputated incidents of COVID-19, thus considering the natural course of COVID-19, in each country of the EU/EA and UK, during 1 January – March 1520.
We also showed a combined number of reported cases in each country on 15 March 2020 8:00 a.m. compared with those in Italy at 31 January–15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Trains in the countries of EU/EA and UK
The trends of 14 days without a combination of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EA and UK will follow generally the Hubei Province (Cafina) (Lary 1).
For the EU/EA and the UK in general, the combined incidence of COVID-19 began to rise in about 21 February and then soared to about 28 February 2020 (Explusive material).
Most of this is triggered by a dramatic rise in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all the other countries of the EU/EA and UK show the same rising direction as the combined incidence of COVID-19 (Eal material).
Figure 2 shows the combined number of cases of COVID-19, in the countries of EU/EA and UK compared with Italy at 31 January – 15 March 2020.
This highlights that, on March 15 8:00 a.m., 15 other countries in the EU/EA and UK reported a total of cases comparable to Italy in the preceding 3 weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of announced cases of COVID-19 is rising rapidly in the EU/EA and UK.
The noted goals in the combined incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is moving ahead at a comparable pace in all countries.
This is even when countries are at different stages, there are differences in national responses to public health, and possibly different definitions of the case in countries and various protols in selecting patients who should be tested for COVID-19 signature, including a follow - up examination.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which ca 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care and reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their highest capacity.
The data on entering COVID-19 cases into a hospital and/o unit of intensive care is currently available at the EU/EA level only for 6% and 1% cases, mentioned (not shown data).
Nevertheless, they must be collected in a systematic method to add to current data by surveillance aimed at the number of recorded cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted in 2010 -11 showed a significant difference in the effectiveness of intensive care and beds in middle care in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer sources than Italy (12.5 beds of intensive care and intermedate care for every 100,000 population in 2010–11).
Modelling scenarios related to healthcare capaitity in recognition, with etimates for each EU/EA countryry and the UK of the Prevalence of the hospitalized COVID-19 casess as well associated womb; 90% rigk of extended intensive care, are provised in thext update of the ECDCidsk as Censeg-ODVI.
Because cases are combined today by some regions in the countries of EU/EA and UK, and hospitals and units of intensive care (intensive care units) usually serve a designated population, information about cases and beds in intensive care should be better prepared to be used at the level of Nomenclature of terricition units for statistics 2 (NUS-2).
The experience in Italy and current rails in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly developing in the EU/EA and UK.
Countries, hospitals and units of intensive care should prepare themselves for the scenario of the long transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the community and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who need health care, and in particular intensive care, such as is taking place in the affected regions of Italy.
As noted in the recent recent rapid assessment of the danger of ECDC, a fast, active and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, when a transfer is made from near cure to immediate resistance, because the expected rise in the number of cases may not be able to give consent and hospitals enough time to be accepted, and their response if not carried out sooner.
A quick assessment of the danger also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief space in which countries have the possibility of increasing their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and to reduce health - care pressure.
To the disappointment of this, it is likely that the health - care systems of other countries at EU/EA will face an influx of patients who need intensive care within days or weeks to come.
The spread of the disease Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has now killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, which are threatening disasters for humans.
Like a virus similar to this, SARS-CoV, which causes SARS to be found in thousands of people in 2003, can also transmit SARS-CoV-2 from bats and produce similar symptoms by means of a similar mechanism.
Nevertheless, COVID-19 has lower seriousness and mortality than SARS but is more easily spreading and affecting more older than young people and more men than women.
In response to a rapid increase in the number of published reports on the rising disease, this article makes an effort to provide an up - to - date and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing subject of research.
We will cover basic knowledge of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although there are many questions that still need answers, we hope that this lift will help to understand and eliminate the threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020, became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory of all Chinese who were encouraged to stay indoors during the entire vacation and for weeks afterward as a result of the spread of a new disease from the virus.
The virus has much in common with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; thus, it came to be called SARS-CoV-2 of the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease -19 (OVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wanan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and about 50 others around the world.
On March 2, 2020, the virus struck more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients being sent home and more than 3,000 patients killed.
" WHO reminds us that COVID-19 is "number 1 public enemy" and possibly stronger than terrorism."
According to PubMed (htps:/www.ncbi.nm.h.gov/pubmed/), below two months, more than 200 papers have been published in COVID-19 together with science in studying microbiyo, educational lessons, origins, autognosis, and treatment since the first report of January 7,20 that pointed to the order of the microbigio separate from many patients.
This rebyung tries to comb the progress of research in the new, rapidly developing area of the subject.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an increase in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned about prevention and diagnosis of disease as well as some of the remaining but immediate questions.
CoVs are traditionally regarded as nonfatal pathogens in humans, leading to about 15% of the common cold 4.
Nevertheless, in this century, we have twice encountered the high pathogenic human CoVs, meaning that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an increase that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, as described, and soon spread to many other countries with appalling maught and mortality.
Therefore, the present COVID-19 is the third spread of CoV in recorded human history.
As show in Fig. As indicated in Fig. Fig.1, masses of pneumonia unknown to the origin were first reported from Wan on December 31, 2019 in China's National Health Commission (National Health Commission).
Seven days later, CoV sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case from Wan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, rural areas, and countries.
On January 20, health - care providers reported their applications, suggesting that human transmission is possible.
On January 23, Wan's city was locked down with all its public transportation stopped.
On January 24 the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had a direct contact in Wanan's shellfish market that was considered a breeding ground for infection from unknown animal sources.
On January 30, WHO declared the spread of a global health epidemic.
By the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig. 2) .2). (Fig.2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the extended scope and severity of the spread remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a mass study center for 8,866 patients included 4,021 confirmed patients of COVID-19 showed more time - honored descriptions of epidemics such as the following (htttps://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rXPAqHAbhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has inherited people at all ages, but above all at the age of 30-65.
About half (47.7%) of infected individuals were over 50 years of age, fewer children than 20, and only 14 infected people were younger than 10 years.
More men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000) are infected with SARS-CoV-2.
The COVID-19 spread out mainly and around Hubei.
COVID-19 lasts an average of 5 (2-9) days from beginning to diagnosis.
The average period of indention is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) sun.
The average length from beginning to death was 9.5 (4.8-13) sun.
The bacterial reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 by 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the time of mass travel prior to the Taggosta in China.
The mortality of includings conformed cases was 1.14% (95% CI: 1.10-86%), and the adjusted mortality of all the consequences was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-49%).
The three main causes of risk for COVID-19 are gender (males), age (ia60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are subfamilies of large, wrapped viruses containing a single string of sense RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, holls., alphas, beta, gamma, and delta, where alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to defile people.
The envelope spike (S) glycopotein unites cellular receptors that are the cinotin-confusion enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as noted, and then the membrane desion takes place.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after the replicating of the viral genome, the genomic RNA combined with the wrapped glycopoteins and nucapsid proteins forms besiles containing the virion, which then joins the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 has been identified as a new type of beta-CoV with more than 99.98% genetic identification of 10 successive samples collected from the original site of expansion, the Huananan Seafod Market in Wan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By means of transmission electronscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles have been found in overcisional areas of epithelium in the human air tract.
Human ACE2 has been found as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as for SARS-CoV.
Nevertheless, S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds ACE2 of people to a weaker level than SARS-CoV, with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe interaction with patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein edited by orf3b and a secreted protein edited by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may have a role in the viral pathogenicity and prevent the IFN praying; nevertheless, orf8 does not contain any known functional domain or mitif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported the royal structure of the entire human ACE in 2.9 A resolution with amino acid transporter B0AT 1.
They found that the complex, with its open and closed columns, was gathered as a diary and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could gird two proteins, giving evidence for CoV's identification and inspection.
B0AT1 can be a medical target for warning drugs to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The background and intermedate host
It was known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from bats and were transferred to humans by lynx and camel, as mentioned.
By means of the physiochemical comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, the native host of SARS-CoV-2 is considered bats because the new virus is 96% identityal to two mARS CoVs from bats called bat-CoVZ45 and bat -COVZ21.
Still, it remains unknown what intermedate host helped the virus cross the barrier of species to infect humans, and the transmission route should still be clear.
Ji, et al., suggests snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to people who are involved in re - creating the same material inside S protein.
According to the study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that the pangolins - long-ngus, ant - eating mammals that are often used in the traditional Chinese medicine -- are the pop intermedate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% genetic homology in a CoV discovered in the pangolins and SARS-CoV2.
Nevertheless, the 1% difference spread over the two genomes is still quite different; thus, the negative results for concrete ebidenya are awaited (Fig. 33) (Fig.33).
The physical parts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been generally identified.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can live in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days under 20 °C and 40%-50% chewing.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar characteristics.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and is heated in 56 illustrateC for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, disinfectants containing chlorine, gascetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively stop the virus.
The whole human population in general has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and canwid is susceptible to the new virus.
At present, no detailed study has been reported on the immunologic response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we could only consult earlier studies with other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4) .4) (Fig.4).
Generally, after a virus attacks the host, the host innate immune system first recognizes it by means of the instant recognition receptors (PRRs) together with the C-type lectin-licke receptors, Toll-lice receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors (NLR) ), and RIG-Ike receptors (RR).
Through various passages, the virus begins the appearance of causes of inflammation, dendritic dedritic sulates, and synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that detect the spread of the virus and stimulate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
Nevertheless, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus break free from immune resistance.
In a relatively short time, allergic immune resistance has joined in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes along with CD4 + and CD8+ T cells play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies in particular to the virus, and CD8 + T cells kill viral selyulas.
The two - year - old Tellers produce protein cytokinines to help defensive selyulas.
Nevertheless, CoV can suppress T cell functions by starting with the death of T cells.
The humoral immunization includes such additives as C3a and C5a and antibodies is also important in combating viral infection.
For example, the antibodies that are suspended from the cure are treated in MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overoccupation of the immune system creates large numbers of local free radiocals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and, at the worst of scenarios, snaps of many organs and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, highlighted at first, is more likely to affect older people withmorbidities and pregnant women.
Usually people exposed to large numbers of viruses or who compromise immune reactions, have a higher chance of infection than others.
Ian inculbation period inRS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, often 3-7 days based on a lesson in the first 425 cases in Wan.
Nevertheless, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the period of infection was 3 days on average and from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the period of concentration is 4.8 (3.0-7.2) the sun based on the demography of 8,866 cases.
It is vital for health authorities to work out effective quarantine time based on the most accurate period of infection, in order to prevent infected but symptomless people from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, indibidals exposed to, or infected with, virus usually have to be quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
COVID-19 often deals with fever, which can be accompanied by mild or other symptoms such as a dry cough, aching, muscle pain, dizziness, headaches, swollen throats, an accumulation of fluid in the nose, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients suffer from respiratory and/o hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients have advanced rapidly in the development of acute respiratory syndrome, septatic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/o respiratory symptoms and chronic fever, even if there are no abnormalities in the image of the lungs, should develop for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographer study in late December 2019 showed that the essence of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry coughs, 55% for breathing, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar acquaintances have been reported on in two recent studies in a family cluster and a cluster resulting from passing from an indibidal asymptomatic.
By comparison, a 2012 demographer study showed that MERS-CoV patients also developed fever (98%), dry cough (47%), and breathing (5%) as their main symptoms.
Nevertheless, 80% of these require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and according to a higher MERS death than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and swollen throat (21%) were also noted in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29% -75%), breathing (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and swollen throat (13-25%) are major symptoms and need ventilation support for patients.
By February 14, COVID-19 was 2% when the confirmed case reached 66,576 worldwide.
By comparison, the mortality rate in SARS in November 2002 was 10% of 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a demographic study in June 2012, the death was 37% of 2,44 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47 with a 95% gap of trust (CI) 5.71-7.23, while R0 of SARS-CoV reached only from 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV with their symptoms, death, and R0 was shown in the Talanan1.1.Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher ability to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is not fatal than the last two.
Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The tied start often occurs in both families or from the same gathering or vehicle as a cruise ship.
Patients often have a history of travel or living in Wanan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients two weeks before the beginning.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that people can have the virus without symptoms for longer than two weeks and patients who have been cured from hospitals may carry the virus again, which provides an alarm for the duration of the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced rate of peripheral white blood plaques (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
As an example, lymphopenia with the white blood sultry < 41109/L along with the number of lymphocytes as < 1z109/L, and the elevated levels of astrotate anotsferase and viremia were found in the 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of liver and muscle and myogloin enzymes have been increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sectionation have been increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the D-dimer level, a fibrin degradation product present in the blood, was raised, and the number of lymphocytes was gradually reduced.
The radography abnormalities of the chest are found in most COVID-19 patients and are featured by the bilateral shafts or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often develop an athletic pneumonia, chronic lung damage, and acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the gas exchange.
Type-I and type-II pneumocytes misacterize the level of surfactant and increase the tension above, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs that expand and increasing the risk of lung giving.
Thus, the worst known radographic in the chest is often in line with the worst limit of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first study of the cause of the disease COVID-19 showed the spread of pneumocytes, the development of the glass membrane, and interstitial lymphocytes infiltration, and multicleciated syncytulas in the lungs of a patient who died of disease, who is in harmony with the pathology of viral andARD infection and is similar to that of SARS and MS patients.
The discovery of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the primary standard for cycling COVID-19.
Nevertheless, with a high level of false-negative rate, which can speed up the epidemic, clinical manipestation began to be used for diagnosis (which is no longer dependent on China's RT-PCR) on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation took place during the betrayal of SARS.
Thus, a mix of the history of disease, clinical manipestations, laboratory tests, and radioologicals that have been known is essential and necessary for producing an effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protool using the SHERLOCK technique based on the CRISPR to see SARS-CoV-2, focusing on synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments in 20 ch-18 mol/L to 200 $-18l MoL/L (100 copies per microliter) using a ditick for a longer hour.
It is hoped that the new method will be able to detect sensitivity and relief if active in clinical samples.
Because of a lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians may provide basic support for COVID-19 patients; while testing various therapies used or previously recommended for treating other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS- CoV and other viral diseases (Hanyanyan (yan2).
These treatments include current and conventional treatments for antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even plasma from cured patients was recommended for medical use.
Dimatic compressors advance to form antibodies and vaccines against microbiyo.
SRS-CoV-2 attacks initial lungs and is also likely to attack, at a lower level, other organs declaring ACE2, such as the intestinal system and kidneys.
Nevertheless, the failure to function and to breathe is a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Thus, breathing support is critical to eliminate symptoms and save lives and include general oxygen treatment, high oxygen flow, inadequate ventilation, and ventilation control depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to be supported by an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiovascular bypass technique that is used in treating the threat of heart contact or breath.
In addition, maintaining the balance of electrolyte, controlling and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and the maintenance of the functions of important organs are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It has been known that a cytokinine storm reacts from the overreaction of the immune system to SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokinine storm is a form of sytomic response to the inflammation reponse featured by showing a series of cytokines including TNFFS, IL-1lem, IL-2, IL-6, IFNDA, IFNDANDA, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune cells to release large amounts of free radios that are the main cause of the ARDS and the glance of many organs.
immunosuppression is essential to treating cytokinic storms, especially chronic patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumabs, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibodies, were used in treating cytokinine storm.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokinine storm include the slide of T cell-directed immune resistance; the blockion of IFN-ica, IL-1, and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; supppressor of cytokin signaling 4; and HDAC inhitors.
steroids, as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in SARS treatment to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
However, steroids that have high doses of serious lung damage in SARS and COVID -19 patients are not beneficial.
Rather, they can cause serious side effects, especially vascular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects prognosis.
Nevertheless, short courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use for COVID-19 patients who had a critical disease.
During writing, no effective antiviral treatment was confirmed.
Nevertheless, intravenous giving with ridesivir, a nucleotide anologist, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
A new antiviral drug is Remdesivir that Gilead first developed for treating the diseases caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
In time, remdesivir also showed possible control of other pinand RNA viruses along with MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead gave the compound to China to perform a pair of tests on the indibid communities infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results were expected in most.
In addition, bricinb, interferon's, lopinavir/cinavir, and rivervirin have been proposed as pop therapy for patients with chronic respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other bad reactions can occur following the used treatment of loinvir/rirenavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma from recovering patients and producing antibodies
Collecting blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to protect healthy infectiouss from infection has a long history.
Indeed, patients who recover often have a slightly higher level of antibodies against the cause of their blood disease.
The antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to combat causes of disease and other foreign objects and recognize special molecules in causes of disease and directly neutralize them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who recovered from COVID19 and injected into 10 seriously ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, combined with a reduced inflammation and virus charge and improved oxygen fraction in the blood.
Nevertheless, verification and clarification are needed to recommend the method for large - scale use before certain therapies are developed.
In addition, because of therapeutic effects, some plasma - related dissellents should be considered carefully.
For example, antibodies can overheat immune resistance and cause cytokinine release syndrome, which is a commercial poisoning threat to life.
Antibodies usually have low concentrations in the blood, and the need for plasma is great for treating critical patients.
It is difficult to assemble and produce particular antibodies at enough speed to fight the global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more critical and practical to isolate sely adults B from recovering patients and to distinguish genetic codes from effective antibodies or to process effective antibodies against vital viral proteins.
In this way, we can easily measure the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
Nevertheless, its effects depend primarily on a mix of many ingredients in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most effective ingredients remain unrecognizable or vague because it is difficult to pick up and vercate the ingredients or their best combinations.
Presently, because of a lack of effective and particular therapy for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the major alternative treatments for patients with mild - to - moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective for treating COVID-19.
The leading charges for treating COVID-19 patients were observed in some rural China that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ninxia (50%), and Hinan (50%), while the province of Hubei, which used TCM only in an estimated 30% of COVID19 patients, had the lowest recrat of recovery (13%).
Nevertheless, this is a rather rude comparison because many other causes of such powerful effects as the number and severity of patients should be included in inflammation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study that compared with the treatment of western medicine (WM) only in used treatment by WM and TCM.
They learned that the hours required for recovery of body temperature, loss of symptoms, and hospitalization were markedly shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM alone.
The most impressive, the number of symptomatic extremes (from light to serious) is noted to be lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM alone (7.4% against 46.2%) and the death rate is below the WM+TCM group (8.8% counter to 39%).
Nevertheless, TCM's effectiveness and survival are still awaiting tests that are well controlled and that are wider and that are at more centers.
It is also intriguing to attribute character to the mechanism of actions and to clarify the effective components of TCM treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspect or confirmed COVID-19 experience much fear of highly contagious and deadly disease, and people withquarantine also experience boredom, loneliness, and anger.
Furthermore, symptoms of such infections as fever, lack of oxygen reaching tissue or hypoxia, and cough as well as side effects of such treatments as insomnia caused by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and mental concern.
During the early stages of SARS ' spread, a range of psychiatric morbidities including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor extensions, psychotic symptoms, delirium, and even suicide were reported.
Forced runs on kotak and quarantine, as part of the responses of public health to the spread of COVID-19, can make people more concerned and guilty with the effects of infection, quarantine, and stigma in their families and friends.
Therefore, mental care should be given to COVID-19 patients, those who are suspected of being divided, and people who associate with them as well as the general public in need.
Mental support should include establishing multidisciplinary mental health groups, clear communications with regular and accurate time on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to prevent close contact with each one.
Effective vaccines are essential for halting the transmission chain from pregnant animals and infected humans to easily contaminated host and often antiviral medical aids in controlling epidemics caused by developing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop Stein-based vaccines to produce long - term and effective chemical antibodies and/or protective immunizations against SARS-CoV.
Living-attenated vaccines have been diagnosed in animal models for SARS.
Nevertheless, the effectiveness of these candidates vaccines in old inhibitants and models of the deadly challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus interference is not known before a clinical study begins.
This may have been because SARS died 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
In contrast, sporadic cases and MERS clusters continue to take place in the Middle East and spread to other regions because of the continuous zoonotics that trigger the endemis.
The vaccination strategies were developed for MERS by the use of infinated virus, DNAplasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, partitions and recontort proteins subunits and were diagnosed by some of the animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for nonresponsive inhibitions is an immediate and critical task for controlling the present epidemic.
Nevertheless, it is a challenge to survive the long period (which takes up to 18 months) needed to develop the vaccine and the dynamic variations of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 had just been called upon to show its full clinical course to thousands of patients.
In most cases patients can recover very little without sequelae.
Nevertheless, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high rate of illness and death among patients with severe cases.
Until recently, the development of the model of disease protection is essential for health - care agencies to give priority to their services, especially in areas where access is limited.
Based on clinical studies reported to this day, the following reasons may affect or be linked to the prognossis of COVID-19 (Talaranan33) patients:(Table33):
Age: Age: Age is the most important reason for SARS ' prognosis, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 basically happened at the age of 30-65 with 47.7% of patients over 50 in a school of 8,866 cases as described above.
Patients in need of intensive care are more likely to have hidden comorbidities and complications and meaningful older than non (in median age 66 against 51), which recommends age as a prognostic factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Sex: Kasarian: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 counter to 0.27/100,000), such as those pictured above.
Comorbidities and complications: Coorbidities and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who needed intensive care were more likely to suffer from chronic heart damage and arthythmia.
Heart events are also a major cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also rub in with ACE2-positive cholaniocytes, which can lead to liver failure in COVID -19 patients.
It is vital to remember that age and hidden illness are closely linked and can disturb each other.
Abnormal Laboratory dendings: Unnormal misunderstandings in the laboratory: The level of the C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and suggests that a random prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy, and complete recovery.
The accordion of CRP level in severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aantotransferase (AST), naming aantransferase (ALT), and creatine dye (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely displayed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditionally signs of wrong heart or liver function.
Major clinical symptoms: Mayor clinical symptoms: Radography of chest and temporary development of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other issues for predicting the consequences and complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: Using steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressant commonly used as an addive therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammation damage.
Because a high dose of corticosteroids is widely used in serious SRS patients, many survivors have suffered from avascular osteonecrosis with a life disability and poor quality of life.
So, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short time in COVID-19 patients.
Mental Stress: Mental stress: As described above, in the spread of COVID-19 many patients have suffered from extraordinary stress because they often endure long periods of quarantine and severe uncertainty and have witnessed the death of close family members and fellow patients.
It is important to give psychological advice and long - term support to help these patients recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies to this day, SARS appears to have different ecological properties in COVID-19.
In addition to copying the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 may effectively increase in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, as do other CoVs that cause common colds.
Until recently, infected patients may develop many viruses during daily activity, causing great difficulty in controlling epidemics.
However, SRS-CoV transfer was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while most of the move did not occur in the first part.
Thus, the current spread of COVID-19 is more serious and difficult to control than is the spread of SARS.
A great deal of effort is currently under way in China along with the lockdown of WAN and surrounding cities and the continuing quality of nearly the entire population in hopes that SARS-CoV-2 will be cut off.
Although these actions have greatly damaged the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients has dropped, indicating a decline in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate will end the spread by the end of March and the drying will last 3-4 months.
Nevertheless, some experts are not so tropical.
Paul Hunter, et al., asked that COVID-19, which seemed more contagious than SARS, would not end by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., set up a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect the twoths of the world population.
One school group reported that SARS-CoV-2 had been observed in the same mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who had recovered and had left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could be a cycle episode similar to the flu.
Nevertheless, promises have occurred in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that present disktetes may be at work.
The ebolia was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases of half a million deaths.
Nevertheless, by keeping too close and isolating, the disease eventually stopped.
It is possible that like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become weaker in vomiting and eventually die or become a virus with a disease that lives with humans.
The comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. (Fig.55) (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is fully transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and it can also be by direct contact with viral - contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in wastes, adding a new possibility of contamination from waste to mouth.
A new study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases could cause hospital impulses, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 health care providers.
Thus, care must be taken to protect people, especially health-care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even observers from contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of defense that can be used to lower the risk of inflammation is by wearing face masks; both by using surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (serye # 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
The surgical facial masks inhibit liquid droplets from a semitensial infected inside from air travel or attaching them to the surfaces of materials, where they can be passed on to others.
Nevertheless, N95 (serye # 1860s) only masks can protect against breathing varions as small as 10 to 80 pms, with only 5% of virions that can penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the size of SARS-CoV and is both maturely 85 pm.
Because particles can pass through even five placed surgical masks, health care providers directly associated with patients should wear N95 (ery # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health - care providers should wear a joint reaction gowns to reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also be infected by an indibidal with eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he wore N95 masks; the virus could enter his body with swollen eyes.
Thus, health-care providers should also wear clear shields on the face or antipara while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or semiten social areas, it has been strongly suggested that all people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more frequently than ever before, try staying indoors for self -quarantine and restrict the contact with pops infected with indibidal.
Three feet are considered an ideal district for people to take advantage of a patient.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection as well as to suppress the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has been transmitted as a new virus in the human world, its high homology in SARS-CoV as reported in 7 January 2020 should have caused high alert to China based on its deep memory of the spread of SARS in 2003.
Nevertheless, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Inan Control Center calmed citizens by saying that the new virus has a low rate and a limited increase from man to man and that it is not a problem to prevent and control disease.
This message has dramatically calmed the public alarm, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Festival of Spring, and passed the critical opportunity to prevent the disease at its lowest level in Wan.
China's disease control agencies may consider this difficult lesson and make critical improvements in the future.
For example, these agences should be (1) more careful when making public schemes because every word is important to the citizen and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) more sensitive and active in non - ordinary information from clinics than to wait for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more rigidly restricting a potensial epidemic at its early stage rather than attempting to trap the public; and (4) more frequent targets and drills to increase awareness of the public disease in order to improve and to improve the social response.
The spread of the COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and near 50 other countries around the world during this writing.
Because the virus is about the same as SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the spread of COVID-19 has created the feeling of repeating SARS.
Nevertheless, there are some amazing differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for preventing epidemics and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older indibidals than young and more men than women, and the severity and rate of death are also higher for older individuals than for young people.
SARS is higher in mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% over 1.14%).
COVID-19 patients spread the virus without symptoms while SARS patients usually do so when they are seriously ill, causing more difficulty in preventing the spread of COVID-19 than in SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA assay can be negative for SARS-CoV-2 in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may regain a positive outlook on the virus.
These data dramatically increases the risk of spreading the virus.
Because of the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, several critical issues remain to be settled, such as the following:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% genetic homolog has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two-ARSy bat CoVs, we still cannot establish from bats SARS-CoV-2.
To what animal can the intermedate species transfer the virus from the original host, let's say that bats, to humans?
The answers at #1 and 2, we do not have the electricity to break the transfer, and the spread can be repeated at any time.
Although molecular spraying and biochemical assays have demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 unites ACE2, how exactly does the virus get into the respiratory channels and produce the resultant pathological changes?
Does the virus also gird the selyulas that proclaim ACE to other organs?
If there are no clear answers to these questions, we cannot obtain quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus develop genetically during transmission to humans?
Will it be a pandemic around the world, vanishing like SARS or periodically return like the flu?
This is important but may take some time to find answers above and many other questions.
Nevertheless, no matter what may be asked to replace us, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic soon and bring our lives back to normal.
Zoonotic origin of man's coronavirus
Mutations and appropriateness have pushed coronavirus (CoVs) and their host, including humans, together for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two CoVs of humans (HCoV) were identified as sewing a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The prevalences of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have shown how HCoV's infection is harsh and life threatening.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 put the CoVs to a fresh note and surprised us with its rapid move but reduced pathogenicity or the cause of disease compared with its SRS-CoV brother.
The HCoV presection is a zoonosis and the understanding of zoonotics from which the HCoVs come will serve us properly.
Most HCoVs come from bats where they do not cause disease (pathogen).
The intermedate reservoir hostes of some HCoVs are also well - known.
Referring to animal hostages has direct implications in avoiding human diseases.
An investigation of CoV-host links with animals can also take an important look at the CoV pathocesis of humans.
In this rebyu, we show a general view of existing knowledge of seven HCoVs, with reference to the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and migrations to species.
The important thing is that we compare and separate various HCoVs from a view of viral evolution and recongrating the genome.
The current disease CoV 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic is discussed in this context.
Moreover, what is needed for successful host transmissions and the implications of the virus's evolution to the severity of the disease are also addressed.
Coronavirus (CoV) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which is made up of a group of envelopeds, positive-sensed, single-stranded RNA viruses.
" These viruses cover the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilograms among RNA viruses has been called "CVs" because of their morpology as a crown under the electron microscope."
In the structure, CoVs have genomes that do not play a role that distributes the same order.
It is estimated that two-mkalo of the genome contains two large parallel open - line reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated intopp1a andpp1ab replicase polypubins.
polyproteins are better processed to produce 16 nonstructural proteins, named nusp116.
The rest of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some of the specific lines of accessory proteins are also edited by various CoV lines.
Different from protein sequences, CoVs are classified in four genesras (alpha-CoVs, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where beta-CoV genes contain the largest number of HCoVs and divide into four lines (A, B, C and D).
The physionetic ebidenas show that bats and rodeents serve as the source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammas-CoVs and deltas.
During thousands of years, CoVs continue to cross species boundaries and some appear to be important man's pathogens.
Today, seven human CoVs (HCoV) are known.
Of these HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
Other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiry syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East rehabilitation syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-V-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually sew mild symptoms, such as common colds and/o diarrhea.
In the third instance, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are full pathogenic, which sews serious infections on the lower respiratory tract to the slightly higher patients with a higher chance of having acute retylizers syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary symptoms.
The first piin of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from patients ' common colds in mid - 1960.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through extensive studies in HCoV-229E and HCoV-OCC43, both of which produce self - induced symptoms.
In fact, the concept that usually does not harm HCoVs was widely accepted until the outbreak of SARS.
The march of SARS that took place in 2003 is one of the most grim of current history, which has infected more than 8,000 people with an initial death case of 10%.
Ten years later, the spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has struck a continuing epidemic on the Arabian Peninsula with its occasional worldwide spread.
The 2019 new HCoV (2019-nCoV), which then changed the name to SARS-CoV-2, was responsible for the agent for the continuing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which claimed more than 3,120 lives and satisfied more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm is already ringing and the world has to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have a zoonotic origin from bats, rats or pets.
A number of lines of evidence support an evolution from which all HCoVs come from bats, where viruses adapt well and are not yethogen but show a good genetic difference.
The COVID-19 epidemic presented a major challenge to medical, science, society and morals in China and around the world.
The monitoring of the zoonotics from which the HCoVs came provides a framework to understand natural history, cause and factors that restrict migration into species.
It can also guide or facilitate the search for storage, middle and athletic (s) SRS-CoV-2 host animal, with important implications for avoiding future spreadings.
In this rebyu we show a general view of zoonotic origins, moving between the species and pathogenes of the HCoVs.
In particular, we focus and discuss the common theme that parents of HCoV viruses are usually not (pathogenic in their natural reservoir host but become pathhogenic after cutting between species at a new host.
We also examine the evolution process of HCoV in which the rate of passage is often accompanied by a drop in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the continuing spread of SARS-CoV-2 was also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the 1930 ' s.
Before the first separation of HCoV-229E strin B814 from patients ' nose juice with a common cold, various CoVs were isolated from various infected animals, including sobs, rats, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
In recent decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A chief summer of the history of HCoV discovery in chronicological order (Table 1) would development and institution.
The first string of HCoV-229E was separated from the respiratory tract of patients with the upper respiratory tract in 1966, and eventually adapted to grow in the lung cells WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E showed common symptoms of colds, including headaches, sneezes, sore throats and swellings, which were diagnosed with fever and coughs found in 10 really20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and followed by a surgical transfer to the brain of baby rats.
The clinical features of the HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to the causes of HCoV-229E, whose symptoms cannot be identified from the impestion of other pathogens of the respiratory tract such as influenza viruses and rhinovirus A.
The same HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are spread around the world, and they are probably transported during winter in temperate weather.
Often, the period of infection of these two viruses is lower than a week, followed by the six-lingg disease.
According to one volunteer study, healthy insomnians infected with HCoV-229E developed a gentle common cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed serious infections in the lower respiratory tract.
" SARS, also known as "aypical pneumia", is the first well - documented cause of the HCoV pandemic of human history and the economic agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered."
The first case of SARS can be traced back to late 2002 in China's Guangnged Province.
The SARS epidemic reported 8,096 reported cases of 7774 dead, which spread to many countries and continents.
In addition to those who spread strongly, it has been estimated that each case may cause two second cases to develop, with a time of hatching or inculation of 4 to 7 days and the height of a viral load appear on the 10th day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV at first were seen with myalgia, headaches, fever, masaise and trembling, followed by dyspnea, cough and respiratory irritations as the last symptoms.
The lymphopenia, tests on the function of the damaged liver, and lifting the creatine nise are common abnormalities in the SARS laboratory.
The loss of the diffuse alveoler, the spread of epithelial cells and the rise of macrophages have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later require intensive maintenance and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower parts of the respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidney may also be detected in these more serious cases, usually accompanied by cytokinine storm, which can be especially lethal to patients who are vulnerable to disease resistance.
The virus was first isolated from an open lung biopsy by a relative of the sign patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, intense effort has been focused on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7 - month - old child from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was first found to be widespread among children, adults and patients with poor resistance to respiratory diseases.
Coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchioitis are common in HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described separating the same virus from a nose specimen from an 8 - year - old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is actually scattered around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 consists of approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and the height of its range occurs in the early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to a craving throat disease, also known as a croup.
In the same year, HCoV HHKU1 was separated from a 71 - year - old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchioitis in Hong Kong.
Apart from the development of pneumonia and bronchioitis from the community, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be associated with chronic increased asthma.
As in HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found around the world, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCoVs derived from the community are more likely to adapt well to people and generally are less likely to contribute to high pathogenic diseases, even though accidents occur for unknown reasons such as in a rare case of a much more virulent subtype of HCoV-L63, which recently reported to cause serious infection in the lower spirit tract in China.
Often, when these HCoVs develop the ability to spread rapidly and remain constant inside people, they reduce their vullentism.
MERS-CoV was first separated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60 - year - old patient who developed chronic pneumonia and stone drops in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory - confirmed cases came from the Middle East, informant cases with an occasional second spread to close relationships were reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Another second spread took place in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
MERS clinical displays resemble SARS, which can be described by progressive chronic pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop a chronic stone glance, which today is unique for MERS in the diseases that cause HCoV.
More than 30% of patients have intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2500 diagnosed laboratory cases were reported to have high cases of death of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive viruses known to humans.
In mid - to late December 2019, rows of pneumonia patients who in retrospect were known to be linked to the SRS-CoV-2 script were identified in Wanan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has announced the continued spread of infection in the lower respiratory tract caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergence as a Global Problem (Piverc Health Emergency of International Concern) and has also called the COVID-19 disease.
Up to March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were signed worldwide, with an estimated death rate of 3.4%.
Interestingly, the case of death in Hubei, China 4.2%, while outside it 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory intolerance such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is seen as fever, cough, and respiratory discomfort.
Diarrhea has also been seen in some patients.
pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can develop rapidly in acute respiratory stress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are almost identical because of high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they line various branches in the physilogic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 seems less pathogenic but is more transmitted than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects that do not show symptoms infected with SARS-CoV-2 are reported and that can contribute to the rapid spread worldwide.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveals similarities and differences that are noticeable.
For one thing, the time of the incubator and the duration of the HCoV course are almost the same.
In this connection, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms lingers between SARS-CoV and four community extracts of HCoVs (ie HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the SRS-CoV-2 presection shows characteristics that are more often seen during the inspection of those derived from the HCoV community, including accounts of minor, gentle, or without symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious COVID-19 cases can also be seen as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the rating is slightly lower.
Third, the move of SARS-CoV-2 also shows funny patterns of character in both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs that are available in the community.
In part, the ability to move SARS-CoV-2 is equal to the HCoV extracts in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to be verificed if the ability to transmit by SARS-CoV-2 falls after passings on humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 may have been identified in waste samples.
If the excretion from waste to mouth (fecal-oral transmission) SARS-CoV-2 has an important role like that in the case of SARS-CoV at least under certain circumstances future studies remain to clarify.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 may indicate a sense of time like in cases of HCoVs found in the community.
Nevertheless, highlights of SARS-CoV-2 together with its ability to move, pathogenicity and maintained postmigrations will be able to perform the final fate of the steady spread of COVID-19.
All four HCoVs obtained from the community that produce mild symptoms suit people well.
From another standpoint, it can also be true that people are well adapted to these four HCoVs.
Simply put, the two may have come from ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who have contracted a serious HCoV disease have been eliminated.
To do this, HCoVs must be copied to humans on an adequate scale so that the accumulation of assisted mutations can occur that contradict the host distribution factors.
In this definition, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 spread and the number of people it infects continues to increase, the greater the chance that it is fully suited to humans.
If this is adapted properly, moving it to humans will be difficult to prevent from being controlled by quarantine or other measures.
Over the years, the four CoVs from the community have been moving to human populations, starting with the common cold in patients who respond to the disease normally.
These viruses do not require a storage animal.
In contrast, the overhogenic SRS-CoV and MERS-CoV did not adapt well to humans and were unable to maintain their relaxation within men.
They must maintain and spread their zoonotic reservoirs and look for the opportunity to move to easily contaminated human targets, perhaps by means of one or more intermediaries and strengthening host.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to those of both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and of four HCoVs derived from the community.
It is as contagious as HCoVs who have recovered from the community, at present.
Nevertheless, this causes more disease or pathogenic than those derived from HCoV in the community and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen if it is fully suited to humans and moves inside humans without a reservoir or host animal mediator.
Before discussing HCoV's animal origins, we can consider the meanings and characteristics of evolution, natural reservoir, intermediators and strengthening hostes of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the truancy host of an HCoV if it is to have a closely related ancestor that shares high homoology at the level of order of nucleotide.
The viral ancestor usually adapts properly and is not in the process of pathogenic to this host.
Also, a reservoir host has HCoV continuously and for long - term.
In both cases, the host is naturally infected and the natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV was introduced recently to a host mediator before or by its introduction to humans, it did not fit neatly with the new host and frequent pathogenic.
The intermedate host may serve as a zoonotic source of human intervention and assume the role of an increased host by allowing the virus to move about and then transfer it to humans to expand the range of human infection.
A HCoV may come under a dead-end inspection if it cannot keep it off inside the host mediator.
In contrast, HCoVs can also fit in with the middle host and further establish long - term endemicity.
In this case, the host mediator becomes a natural reservoir host.
Looking back, the ecological data showed that the index case of SARS had a history of contact with game animals.
The subsequent zeroivales suggested that animal traders had a higher rate of anti-SARS-CoV IgGs than the general population.
The masked palm cutts and racoon dogs in animal live markets were first identified with SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is not directly supported by the fact that no additional SARS were reported after all the lynx on the market were killed.
Nevertheless, it has been reported that masked palm cutts from forest or farm that have no exposure to animal life on the market are clearly negative for SARS-CoV, which suggests that masked palmivets may serve only as a means of strengthening host but not as natural reservoir of SARS -CoV.
Interestingly, because 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibilities that many species of small mammals can also serve as a strengthening agent for SARS-CoV's SRS cannot be isolated.
All of this appears to be dead-end host of SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search for SRS-CoV's natural host animal opened a close relationship with bat CoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoes.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other bat CoVs are like 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology in SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for the new concept that bats are host to the growing human pathogens.
Many SRASlike CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified as being from bats, but none other than a so - called WIV1 can be separated as a living virus.
The human cinotantin linking enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 from a sample of bat dung has been shown to use bat, lynx and human ACE2 as a signal for cell entry.
It is intriguing that the landlady of convalescent SARS patients has the ability to challenge WIV1.
Today, WIV1 represents the nearest closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV among bats, which distribute 95% as nucleotide sequence homology.
Even if the similarities between these two viruses are high, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the instant - parent SARS-CoV virus and bats are not the instant reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
Phylogicesynthetic assessment includes MERS-CoV in the same group as CoV-HKU4 of bat and CoV-HKU5 of bat.
The CoV-HKU4 of bat and MERS-CoV use the same host receptors, irregularlyl peptidase 4 (DP4), for viral entrance.
RNAs-dependent RNA polymerase sequences followed by MERS-CoV are physiologicals closer to those of bat betas known from Europe and Africa.
So far, there is no live MERS-CoV found in wild bats.
The MERS-CoV and the nearest relative CoV-HKU25 of the bat divide only 87% nucleotide sequence homology.
Thus, bats may not be the nearest Reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are zeroitive for MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, such as camels from the Middle East in many African countries.
The life of MERS-CoV, the same as the virus found in humans, is swabized from the swabs of dERmedary camels ' noses, which further suggest that camels serve as the sure reservoir host of the MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that general mild symptoms but a significant spread of the virus have been observed on camels experimented with MERS-CoV.
Interestingly, infected camels have released viruses not only through the respiratory route but also by means of extremely bad routes, which are also the main route for viral emissions from bats.
Still, questions remain because many confirmed MERS cases do not have a history of linking with camels before the onset of symptoms, which can be translated between humans or unknown migration routes involving unknown animal species with MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 divides 96.2% nucleotide homology with CoV RaTG13 of bats separated from Rhinolophus affinisive bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the order of variation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too high to install the parent relationship.
This means that bats may not be the fast - speed (s) reservoir host of SARS-CoV-2 unless they find in the future about the same as the bat's CoV.
Perhaps the intermediate host animals of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the species of wild animals that have been bought and killed in the Huan Seafood Whole Market, where many of the first cases of COVID-19 are related, indicating a possible development of transmigration.
A few recent studies based on metagenomic order suggest that a group of endangered small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may also be harbor beta ancel beta-CoVs associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Newolin CoV genomes divide 85-92% sequence of homoology into SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, they are closely related to RaTG13 with about 90% identifying the level of nucleotide.
They combined with two sublineages of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the physionenenetic tree, one of which shares a more similar receptor bindiing domain (RBD) in SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% amino acid sequence identifying.
With a clear difference, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are even more different, even though there is a higher degree of order of homoology in the genomes.
An earlier study of alcohol patients also reported the discovery of viral contigs from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study reinforces various ways of intermingling and man - made sorting to form a partial sequence of the genome consisting of an estimated 86.3% of the entire length of the viral genome.
We cannot isolate the possibility that the pangolin is one of the host animals of SARS-CoV-2.
At present, however, there is no evidence to support a directolin from which SARS-CoV-2 comes because of the sequence of separation between SARS-CoV-2 and solin SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
Moreover, the district between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is much shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and solin SARS-CoV-2-ka associated beta-CoVs.
The evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals remains stable.
While the highest sequence homology was found among RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SAS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, SARS-CoV2 and RaTG13 divide the highest sequence homology throughout the genome.
There is strong speculation that high levels of similarity between RBDs of pangolins INRS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 are caused by evolutionary selective-mediated convergent.
One opposing scheme was in favor of a recongrating between a surin INRS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV and RaTG13 to the third wild species.
As the driving force of evolution, reconvention is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is not yet in the flash zoonotic source of SARS-CoV-2.
Besides the high pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OCC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also educated.
Ebidensy phylogicenenetic suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have come from bat CoVs, as parents of the HCoV-OC43 virus and HCoV-HKU1 were found on rodeents.
It has been reported that a bat CoV called ARCoV.2 (the Appalachian Rise CoV) identified in the North American tricolored bat has shown a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
HCoV-229E, on the other hand, is genetically linked to another bat CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was observed in Ghana, while camels were also suspected of being its intermedate host.
For clarity, current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCoVs has been summed up in photo 1 and Talanan 2.1 and Table 2.
Phylogicetic analysis has provided evidence for the events of transmigration between the HCoV species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed the species that infected humans from pets in 1890, a pandemic was recorded in the respiratory script.
The history of the interspecties transmission of HCoV-229E is not so clear.
The bat's alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E were found.
Between them was a harpca alpha-CoV.
Several lines of evidence support direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans but not harpcas may have had contact with bats in an ecologically divided area.
Instead, people have close links with harps.
Second, the HCoV-229E associated with bat alpha-CoV is different and not yethogenic in bats, while the harpca alpha-CoV has caused the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the harpca alpha-CoV was not found among wild animals.
Thus, the possibility cannot be denied that harpcas have taken HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from men.
In fact, bats are the direct source of man's pathogenic viruses including the rabbit virus, Ebola the virus, Nipah the virus and Hendra virus.
So it is not too surprising that bats can pass HCoV-229E on humans directly.
As an alternative, even the bat alpha-CoVs will serve as the gene pool of HCoV-229E, the harpcas and dromedary camels may serve as intermedate host to transmit viruses to humans, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of moving between species from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolution from which MERS-CoV came from bats was identified by earlier identification and was also strengthened by subsequent discoveries.
Bats evidently provide a fertile source of the virus's species for exchanging between the species of genetic fraction and moving between species.
The length of life, mass colonies, close social contact and the powerful ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats to become a perfect virus - spreader.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV was introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is excellent for these camels to move from an intermedate host to a stable natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes a very mild disease and keeps these animals at a slightly low rate of mutations.
Illing people from time to time is an accident and people remain a deadline host of MERS-CoV because it is not maintained.
Contrary to the role of camels in moving MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, is different from that of SARS-CoV-2.
In particular, the panolin beta-CoVs is a complete pathogenic in pangolins.
They can be a dead-end host for the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV, which is similar to the civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Some possibilities for moving SARS-CoV-2 between species from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, bats may be reservoir host to a SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is about the same as SARS-CoV-2.
Man may be able to divide ecologically suitable areas into bats by killing or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the middle strengthening parties where a virus related to SARS-CoV-2 was introduced recently.
People get the virus by killing and eating the meat of the game.
It is possible that many mammals that include pets are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A survey of pets and wild animals for antibodies is needed.
Third, as mentioned above, the recongrating and adapting of SARS-CoV-2 may have happened to a third species related to both bats and pangolins.
The search for SARS-CoV-2 animal sources is still in progress.
Among the various types of host animals, three basic reasons for the vral are also important in making CoVs easier to cross species boundaries.
First of all, their slightly elevated mutations at the copying of RNA.
" Compared with the other side-strand RNA virus, the estimated number of mutations in CoVs may be considered" moderate" to"" high" with an average substition substitusion T 104 substitus per year on each site 2, depending on the period of CoV's adjustment to new host. "
CoVs have a proof-reading exiribonuclease, the removal of which reduces extremely high levels of friction and weakening or loss of meaning.
Interestingly, the nucleotide anatomy Remdesivir is known to suppress CoV's copying by stopping this exribonuclease and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Cremdesivir is one of the most reliable anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to try on clinical tests.
Nevertheless, CV mutations are about a million times higher than their host.
In addition, mutations rate is often high when CoVs do not fit properly at the host.
Compared with SARS-CoV with high mutations rate, SARS-CoV-2 mutations rate seems lower, suggesting a higher level of adjustment for humans.
Perhaps it was appropriate for other hosts near the crowd.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, it is also applied to MERS-CoV, which is well suited to dromedary camels.
In theory, it is not likely that genetic drift will quickly cancel vaccines and antiviral vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs performs extra plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and regrating, thereby increasing the possibility for a combination of evolution between different species, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
It is backed by a recurring special open - up frame and protein roles that are located at the 36 end of the genome.
"PAPUC, CoVs are randoms and frequently transfer Templates during RNA detection by means of a unique "copy-choice" mechanism."
During a host that serves as a mixing container, the strand exchange often occurs during the CoV RNA transition.
Largely identical whole and subgenomic RNAs can reunite to form new CoVs.
The physiologic evidence of natural recongration was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Intertion virus-host associated with vomiting
In addition to the three factors of the virus mentioned above, the virus's interaction with the host receptors is another major factor contributing to the migration between species.
Here, the reuniting of SARS-CoV was viewed as a common example, which also showed evidence of positive choice as it moved between species.
Based on a comparison between people and SARS-CoVs of lynx, SARS-CoV is thought to be undergoing rapid adjustment to various parties, especially in S protein's RBD mutations.
Often, the RBD in S protein of a CoV has an interview with the cellular receptors and is strictly selected by the host's antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is in the318th to510 amino acid in S1 fraction, which binds man's ACE2 together as well as coreptors for the passage of the virus.
The RBD of SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize ACE's receptors in various animals, including bat, lynx, rat and comments dog, which allow for the transmission of the virus between species.
In fact, only 6 amino acid receptors have been observed that differ from humans andivets separating the virus from RBD and 4 of them have been seen in the receptor-binding motif for the ACE2 receptors interaction.
The Civet SARS-CoV contains K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which can raise the interaction of spike protein with man as ACE2 receptors.
Simply put, two amino acid substitutions can be important to the vraltion that suits humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2's cellular receptors are identical and SARS-CoV.
30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 units of S.S. protein indicates that the uniting link between S protein and the person ACE2 may have been replaced.
In fact, a college -EM study suggests a 10 - to 20-cyclop higher accompanying this bonding than between human ACE2 and SARSCoV S protein.
It will also be an interest to determine whether any other coreptor is needed for SARS-CoV-2 vomiting.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also unites ACE2 but has another part of S.
There are many other HCoV receptors, such as aminoopptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-attylated silic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also report for successful fitting these CoVs with humans after cutting between species from their host animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of HCoVs moving between species is also governed by other host drops and pressure factors.
The contrast between these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of HCoVs such as bats, dromedary camels and animal pests can be a barrier to migration between species.
HCoVs must usurp host dependencies factors and subvert host distribution claim successful relaxation between species.
In this connection, molecular determinants in this vital area of intervention in the virus remain to be referred to and described.
An impartial recording of the host's contact with all genomes and risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the modern technology of the CRISPR can be beneficial.
The appearance of new HCoVs: back to ground zero
The contrast between bat CoVs provides many opportunities for new HCoVs to appear.
In this definition, bat CoVs serve as the gene pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic recongration also push the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, obtaining or losing new protein-coding genes has a policy to alter the vrals with a large degree of phnotype.
Among the key proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be essential for adapting to humans, for bat viruses associated with SARS-CoV are separated but have been found to regulate unvergents of ORF8 proteins.
The ability to remove 29 nucleotides of SARS-CoVs has been found in the string that is isolated at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an assisted mutations that promotes the conversion of parties.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of regrating the origins of alphas -- and gamma-CoV, in which a large number of smaller reconfusion regions were identified at RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Reconvention locations were also identified at nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of psp14.
Also, it was shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic experienced incidents of regrating between different clans, which occurred on Saudi Arabia's dromedary camels.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, repeatations have also been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs have reunited with other animal CoVs in their nonstatrical genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to random changes in the viral genomes, possibly resulting from a decrease in viruses from selection forces, such as the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full-long Of4 in HCoV-229E prototype string, because of a removal of two nucleotides.
As the ORF4 insect can be observed in bat and camel viruses associated with HCoV-229E, the harpca alpha-CoV indicates a single entry of nucleotide, which passes through a frameshift.
Last but important, the evolution of new HCoVs is also caused by pressures in selecting their reservoir host.
No symptoms or mild symptoms were detected when CoV bats were infected, indicating the same fitting between CoVs and bats.
It appeared that bats were well suited to CoVs in connection with anatomy and pisylohika.
For example, behavioral defects in pro-inflammatory's response to bats have effectively reduced the cause of the disease initiated by CoV.
In addition, the natural herbicides in bat selyula activity have been prevented by the upgregulation of the inhibitory natural killer cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and low levels of expression of the principal histocompatibility complex class I of molecules.
In addition, the high levels of the radioactive oxygen species (ROS) formed from high metabobolic activity of bats can both control the detection of CoV and affect proofreading by means of exoribonuclease, thus providing selection pressure for the generation of pinin viruses that are overhogen when introduced to a new host.
Further pathogenic CoV stringains can also develop by regrating, leading to the extraction of new proteins or protein features for adjusting to the host.
Thus, it was not by chance that the three new HCoVs appeared in the last two decades.
coVs are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts like bats and camels.
They race fast without taking a powerful host immune reaction.
Therein lies the secrets of why asmptomatic carriers are visible and what sews to the severe case of human intervention.
Serious symptoms are a major result of the hyperactivation of immune resistance and the cytokinine storm in which the greater the immune response, the greater the damage to the lungs.
On the contrary, for those with no symptoms, immune resistance has been prevented from doubling the transmission of CoV.
The same diskte for removing the restensance response can have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The response of the interferon is particularly powerful for bats.
Thus, the management of the type I interferon during the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 in humans is beneficial.
In addition, NLRP3 inflamamomo activation in bats is defective.
By this rationalization, stopping NLRP3 inflammame using MC950 can be useful in treating COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general theme on which SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV came from.
While a bat beta-CoV is identified that divides 95% of nucleotide homology into SARS-CoV, there is also a bat CoV that divides 96% nucleotide hoomology in SARS-CoV-2.
Because cutts and other market animals were found to contain viruses similar to SARS-CoV, the high - speed host mediators for SARS-CoV-2 were not identified.
Panolin beta-CoVs that are strikingly similar or homologous in SARS-CoV-2 was found, indicating thatolins can serve as one of the intermedate parties or that theolin beta-CoVs may cause genetic fractions in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While the questions persist, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man's work either deliberately or unintentionally.
CoVs have returned to sunlight because of the recent spread of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has changed rapidly in our understanding of the value of zoonotics from the origin and reservoir animals of the HCoVs in man - playing.
The vast economy showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 came from bats and were transferred to humans by intermedate host.
Thanks to the SRS-CoV's impsectation comes from a relationship between people and cutts on markets, closing wet markets and killing them there may effectively end the SARS epidemic.
By both reasoning, theolins must be removed from sales to prevent zoonotic contamination, having been found to have manyolin beta-CoV lines closely associated with SARS-CoV-2.
Nevertheless, whether to transfer and how to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to humans through pangolins and other mammals remains clear in future checks.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels serve as a valuable transportation tool as well as the main source of meat products, milk, leather and wool for local people.
They are widely spread throughout the Middle East and Africa.
So it is impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, such as the wild market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To halt the repeated spread of the MERS, a comprehensive method must be developed to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, along with other measures for controlling inflammation.
Because we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may appear that will bring about widespread growth.
There are a variety of zoonotic CoVs moving into the forest.
In particular, bat CoVs with zoonotic pops differ.
There are many instances when these zoonotic CoVs are changing and reuniting, which regulates the emergence of new CoVs that are more contagious and/o lethal to people in the future.
The traditional eating of wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce the unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the torments of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better plan must be implemented for preparation and response.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They stay in their own natural containers until there is a chance to overflow.
Even though bats have many highlights that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunity for humans to associate with bats and other species of wild animals can be reduced if humans are taught to avoid them.
The constant monitoring of mammals is necessary for better ecological understanding of CoVs and their natural host, which will prove useful in controlling man - to - man contact and future spreadings.
Finally, the most important way to prevent viral zoonosis is to draw people away from ecological areas of the zoonotic virus's natural reservoirs.
Some pieces of the zoonotic puzzle from which SARS-CoV-2 are born are still missing.
First, if bats have produced a foreign virus, SARS-CoV-2 in pangolins, it is easy to see in what events the bats can share and press the same ecologically suitable place.
Second, if bats have a more direct role in human vomiting, human contamination from bats must be identified.
Third, if the third mammal is to be a real intermedate host, it must be clear how it connects with different species.
Finally, because many mammals include pets that may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both monitoring and experimental applications must be done.
Whether it is a bat, pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its virtually identical parents will be identified by future natural host.
Further investigations into this section will explain the evolution path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications for COVID-19 control of humans.
" Dating standards in the diagnostic of COVID-19" taken as a case" and""" and" confirmed case" is necessary"
In the mid - February 2020 ' s, our team published a quick guide in the advice for examining and treating 2019 coronavirus novels (2019-nCoV) that was indicted, and this guide provided our experience and developed an excellent council for fighting against the global pandemic.
Nevertheless, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually being increased on the basis of findings in ongoing research and clinical work experience; therefore, the disks of analysis and treatment are also continuing to date.
" In this letter, we answered a criticism of our guide and gave the latest diagnostic standard of "respected" and" confirmed case" which according to the latest guidance guides in Diagnosis and therapy for the COVID-19 (seventh version) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China."
In December 2019, 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) brought about an increase, which has now been referred to as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and has been named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV- 2).
In the 11th of March 2020, WHO introduced COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SRS-CoV-2 inspection, our team developed a rapid guidance guide and was published online in Military Medical Research in 06 February 2020.
This has attracted much attention since publication.
But remember that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge slowly rise on the basis of ongoing findings in clinical training research and experience; therefore, disks of diagnosis and treatment are also continued to be updated.
Consider, for example, the guides on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http:/www.n.gov.cn/), in 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, released a total of seven editions with some contexts of dramatic change.
Now our guide received an observation of Zhou et al., they introduced a scheme on simple marking based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence for our guidance and also made an important spot for international legal action.
We supported their meaningful work and expressed our gratitude.
Nevertheless, their work also requires dating according to the latest investigations and Gabaies in treating COVID-19 (Teaching the seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to sign the checked case must combine any one item with the features of epic history and two items of clinical indicators to make a comprehensive analysis, or to meet the three items of clinicals indicating when there is no explicit epic history:
Epidemiological history: History of epidemiohiko: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wanan and surrounding areas, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases were recorded on the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) a history of contact with infectious SRS-CoV-2 cases (with positive tests of nucleic acid); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or of breathing from the surrounding city and other areas, 298 years prior to history; 2 C.
Clinical manifestations: clinical appearances: (1) fever and/o symptoms in the respiratory tract; (2) with highlights of the COVID -19 infection; (3) total number of white blood cells showing normal, reduced, or decreased number of lymphocytes during the first stage of birth.
Diagnosing the confedered case should base on unspected case in anany; item of pathogenic or serological envidance as following: (1) real-time PCRRRR test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) viral genome-quencic show homogenity to the gnollious no corvelnavies; (3) positive for the spectrum IMic antibody and INCTOCTOV'TAV'sc; entercrecrete-V'screcrecrecrete-recrecrete-V'screcrecrecrete-recrecrecrete-rec to reprecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecrecre'sem'sem'sem'sem'semsem'sem'semsemsemsemsems.
We will see that the real - hour PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) edition.
The discovery of pathogen in blood employment was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) edition; and then the zeroohical evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the researchers ' ongoing work of looking for an ideal trap of nucleic detection acid for quick analysis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract including blood sacling, which increases the presence of various spectimens, and is supported to bring definite positive results of antibody to the confirmed standard.
In addition, more and more efficacy reminds us to beware of patients who are unusually psychotomatatic and sour.
" Thus, the chart of the flow of Zhou et al. should be dated, because they classify man without clinical symptoms as "lowly at risk"."
The point system also needs to be proved by additional clinical activity and study.
In conclusion, we expect more direct curiosity and call on readers to give their criticisms.
" For a study of the "respected cases" and "" confirmed cases", we recommend monitoring and following the latest rules of their home countries."
It was also time for our team to date on guidelines to provide help.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the largest one day
Yesterday Bangladesh signed that there were five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
It is the highest mortality rate of a day from germs.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a number of officially infected cases including 114 active cases and 33 cases of recovery that remained at home.
Total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online news service, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, mentioned among those who died were four men and a woman.
According to Dr Meerjady, two cases are 60 and older, two are between 51 and 60, and a 41-50 - year - old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
One hospital official told the Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the dead was Jalalal Saifur Rahman, a director of the Bengali Anti -Corrupation Commission, who was raised at the Kuwait Maitre Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online press video, Bangladeshi Road Transport and Bridges Minister Obaidul Quader said that the public vehicle would stop work longer than had been planned earlier, until it would come Saturday.
The closing of public transportation was first started on March 26 and was planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
The trip of important goods -- medical, fuel and food -- was still tolerated.
The first recorded events of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were March 8, of two persons who came home from Italy and also of the wife of one of them.
By March 19, these three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has passed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections passed one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
A minimum of 52 thousand deaths were linked to COVID-19, the coronavirus disease.
The significant event came on the same day that Malawi confirmed his first coronavirus infections and Zambia gained her first death in connection with coronavirus.
North Korea, on Thursday day, claimed that it was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in twenty - four hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, over 244 thousand cases of coronavirus have been recorded, extending to the minimum of 1,900 dead.
The CBS News, referring to data from Johns Hopkins University, announced that there were more than 1,000 US deaths during the Mieroles transport of coronavirus infections.
Worldwide, nations have advertised more drastic measures to prevent disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city lockdown to May 1.
Throughout the country, President Vladimir Fintin estimated that Russian citizens would continue to be paid without work until April 30.
Portugal's stake was bomoto for the length of national engineering for 15 days; the vote had 215 votes in favor, ten did not participate, and a counterseignant.
The Saudi Arabi extended curfews to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina that lasted for a whole day; before, the curfew had been valid only between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio's governor Mike DeWine announced that the state extended the order of slaughter-at-home to May 1.
Australia's stores read toilet paper limitations in each transaction
On Sunday and Saturday evenings, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their restrictions on buying paper in the bathroom in two and a package per transfer to all stores throughout the country, each one.
ALDI also started a set limit on Monday.
These limitations are passed as messages on checkouts, and on the pages of the chain Facebook.
Consumers reportedly save because of fear of COVID-19 if people have to separate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited what could be purchased for delivery to the home in a package each order.
These changes will follow the last four-steps per transactance restriction introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
" Coles, in the March 8 media release, reported that in four package restrictions, "" many stores still sell for an hour of delivery", and call the demand "no longer", while ALDI, in a post on Facebook on Tuesday, called it" unexpected""".
" Sales have risen" a sharp increase" last week, according to a spokesman for Woolworths."
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the permitted amount in two packages last week.
To alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and took the delivery, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI was on stock for planned Miyerkoles that were specially available early.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australyan Nagistingi Society, said that it was a struggle to raise the goods, but the restrictions of the local council were difficult to make at the timing of truck transport.
He expects rising production costs, for suppliers try to meet the demand, and fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following an early release of goods, some stores could not operate the Wednesday special.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortormer, a trade expert from the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores dominate the establishment at night.
She mentioned that toilet paper is a large item, leading to low stock levels, and, when all are bought, leaving much space in the establishments, adding to the sense of inadequacy.
" Sore Coles and Woolworths [that] if there are many things in the establishment, if such products as toilet roll and snitiser can [sell] and many, perhaps you can reduce panic" Russell Zimmerman said in ABC News."
The manufacturer of the toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, says that they have run out of stock the past Wednesday.
The Pretoria-Clark, which produces Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and the Sorbent Solaris Paper, has granted them 24/7 jobs to maintain the supply, reports News.com.au.
Domin.com, a site real estate, reported some salespeople who offered free toilet paper on the first bidder at Melbourne auctions, much less auctions held because consumers had time off during the long - term week - long Labor or Labour Day.
The Thursday edition of the ENT News, a Darwin newspaper, brought together an eight - page note that was to be cut and used for toilet paper.
Stores originally purchased to enforce restrictions, according to a report from ABC on March 3 in which they said they had no plans to put restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman observed that other products, including masks, snitisers, dried goods, handwashing and flour, were also in high demand.
Similarly, outside Australia, Sunday night saw the online British supermarket Ocido collecting the purchases of Andrew toilet paper in two 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization has announced that COVID-19 is a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) supported the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the coronavirus disease of theRS-CoV-2 — which is a pandemic.
" While the word "pandemy" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, does not indicate how dangerous the cases are, WHO has taken the risk of pushing governments to action:"
" All countries can even change the course of this pandemic.
Seeing, examining, treating, disassociating, the nations drive and move their people in response," according to Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
"We are very concerned about both the alarming levels of spread and severity and the alarming level of inactivity."
" ACcording to Dr. According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pandemic is "unlike."
"He said, in talks published by CNN in February, "except in the flu, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from the appearance to the continuing spread of the world."
" Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that "we had never seen a pandemic issued by a coronavirus""
He continued, "and we have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled by the people."
The new status as a pandemic followed WHO's admission in January to announce the outbreak of commercial health to the public to be remembered international.
" The United States's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease's director, Dr. Anthony Fauci, sid of the outbreak, ""botom line, i's goting to get worse."
Until Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, which caused more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 pandemic coronavirus is a continuing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe chronic respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak of Wanan, China, was identified in December 2019, which was declared an Public Health Emergence (Organic Health Emergency) World Remember (International Concern) on January 30, 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Until 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in an estimated 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The brutal killer of the case is estimated to be 4% in China, covering the world from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fevers, coughs, and gasps.
The complications may include pneumonia and sandroms of chronic respiratory disease.
For five days the time from exposure to onset of symptoms has been temporary, but it may last from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or definition of antiviral treatment.
Symptomatic and therapeutic support are the main treatments. The recommended step in avoiding hand washing is to cover one's mouth when coughing, maintaining disability in other people, and monitoring and isolating themselves for people who suspect that they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantine, curfews, risk controls, and the closing of the facility.
The pandemic led to serious disturbance of social life worldwide, the delay or canceling of games, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of equipment aggravated by panic fire.
Schools and universities are closed to any national or local basis in 193 countries, affecting about 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
False information about microbiyo spread online, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other Orientals and families of the Southern Asia, and others from places with meaningful cases of microbiyo.
The reduced travel and the closing of heavy industries have reduced air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wanan, China (the province capital of Hubei) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases unknown in 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched early in January 2020.
Cases usually have links in the Huan Seafood Wholeale Market and therefore the virus is thought to have zoonotic origin or animal origin and has been translated into man.
The virus that causes outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person with symptoms was later diagnosed as ill in 1 December 2019 , and that person was not shown visible connections in the market crowd later.
In the early number of cases reported in December 2019, two imports related to the market were found.
On March 13, 2020, an uncertain report from the South China Morning Post was proposed that a case monitored on November 17, 2019, in a 55 - year - old from the province of Hubei, might be the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reported rejected in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China at the first time.
There may be an important lack of adequate reporting of cases, particularly those with more mild symptoms.
By 26 February, there were few cases reported to young people, among the 19 down making up 2.4% of cases worldwide, and United Kingdom science chief Patrick Valance was estimated to have been 60% of the British population infected before obtaining an effective herd immunization.
Cases refer to the number of people diagnosed in COVID-19, and their tests were confirmed positive according to official probes.
Until 23 March, no country had examined more than 3% of its population, and many countries had official policies not to examine only those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 established that in China, as far as January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID -19 applications were not noticed, and that these undecirded applications were the source of the impestion for 79% of documented cases.
A statistics study published on March 30 estimated that the number of abortions in Italy is much larger than reported cases.
The initial tattoos of basic reaction numbers (R0) for COVID-19 are 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention feels that it may be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 are cured.
For those who do not, the time from showing symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly living 14 days.
Up to April 1020, some 97,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19.
In China, to February 5 almost 80% of deaths were over 60, and 75% had earlier health conditions including cardiovascular and diabetes. The official death list from the pandemic COVID-19 usually referred to dead people who were diagnosed positive for COVID according to official protocols.
The number of real deaths from COVID-19 may be higher, since it may not be that of the dead who have not been examined. At home, in nursing houses, etc.
From Italy's pale data, it was learned that the death toll during the pandemic exceeded the official death count at the COVID factor 4-5x.
" A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowd "We knoww that [the stated death toll] is an underestimation", a statement corroborated by anectal reports of the undercondition in the U.S.
The first death outside mainland China occurred in 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France in 14 February.
By February 28, in the February 28, issue of mainland China, more than a dozen deaths each had been recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By March 13, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on every continent except Antarctica.
These figures vary according to the region and over time, and are marked by the number of tests, quality of health care systems, medical choices, time from the pre - escape period, and characteristics of the population such as age, sex, and general health. The ratio of death rates in the number of cases reflects the number of deaths that have been divided into the number of diagnosed cases within between hours.
Based on statistics at Johns Hopkins University, the international death ratio in the case was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) until 10 April 2020.
The figures vary according to the region.
In China, estimates for the rating of the number of deaths in the case have been reduced from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms from 1 February 2020) other measures include the number of cases of death or case fatlity rates (CFRR), which detect the percentage of people diagnosed from 1 February 2020) dying of disease or infestate (IR), which detectes the glasses of infected diseases and who die from nonstracticable).
Theseists have no set time and follow a fixed population from infection to judicial settlement.
The number of academics attempted to calculate these numbers for certain populations.
The University of Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine calculates that the mortality rate for pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimates in this row are in line with results from the first chance analysis or raidm testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and the statistical studies that examine the effect of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO believes that the pandemic can be controlled.
The top and longest start is uncertain and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University said, "If not checked, infectious flares will usually reach the top and start to descend afterward when there are no hostables.
But today it is almost impossible to predict when that will happen."
" Chinese government associate medical adviser Zhong Nanshan explains that "it may be completed in June" if all the nations take action to follow WHO's advice on steps to stem the outbreak of the microbia."
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "is going to be writing, patentity for a year or two".
" According to the study of Imperial College conducted by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures are necessary "until there is a vaccine (may be 18 months or more)"."
" William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I don't think this coronavirus is likely -- because it's so easy to transmit it will be completely lost"" and it "can be a seasonal disease, which returns every year"."
The drastic return to the safety of the flock and the extent of the change depend.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively uncertain and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory glutum (plema), loss of smell, breathing, muscle and joint pain, swollen throats, headaches, tremors, vomiting, blood spit, diarrhea, or skin rashes. WHO says that one in six people becomes seriously ill and suffers from breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists such memergence symptoms as breathing difficulties, persistent breast disease or pressure, sudden confusion, wake - up difficulty, and aching face or lips; high medical andension are recommended if there are symptoms. The progress of the disease can lead to acute pneumonia, acute resultatory syndrome, sepsis, shock and death.
Some of those infected may be assimptomatatic, with no clinical symptoms but with test results proving diagnosis, so researchers have issued advice that those who have close contact with a confirmed infected person should be closely monitored and tested to prevent the infection.
The Chinese asked the asymptomatic ratings covered from a few to 44%.
The usual period of inculction (the period between immersion and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; it is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, a small percentage of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell went through 30% and fell later 15%.
Some details about how disease can be spread are still being referred to.
The disease is believed to be spread mainly in the nearby kotak and with a tiny drop from coughing, sneezing, or speaking; with close contact within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that uncovering can produce tiny droplets that travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted by tiny droplets that persist for long periods in the air, which can be formed by speech. The tiny droplets in the breath can also develop at the time of breathing, including speech, even if the virus is not really in the air.
Small droplets may land in people's mouths or noses nearby or can be inhaled to the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiac resuscitation (CPR) can lead to respiratory juices that float in the air and then stulate in the air.
It can also spread when a person touches a contaminated surface, including skin, and then holds their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there are worries that it can spread through human pollutants, this danger is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of the tae-mouthed transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Microbiium was most contagious within the first three days after symptoms began, even though the spread might be before symptoms and the final stages of the disease.
People who have been diagnosed as positive for the disease for up to three days before symptoms appear recommend that transmission be possible before producing meaningful symptoms.
Very few reports exist in cases that do not show the symptom confirmed by the laboratory, but the transmission without symptoms has been identified by some countries as a fight goes out on the kontak.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that while the spread of the disease is not fully clear, a person in general is contagious to two to three others. The virus lives for hours or days on held objects.
To be sure, the microbio was found to be visible for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on the cardboard, and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, will be changed according to moisture and temperature. New animals and other animals have been examined positively in COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the mix on to humans, although British authorities advise that hands be washed after touching animals, such as after contacting other surfaces that infected humans can touch.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a microbiium novel, first isolated from three people with pneumonia in the mass of severe rest cases in Wan.
All the characteristics of the novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses occur in connection with the coronavirus in nature. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective shield. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS- CoV.
It was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic studies have revealed that coronaviruss are a genetic ring in the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two al-pana - bins.
It is 96% equal to the level of the entire genome in other bat coravavirus's coravavirus (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers learned that there is only one difference between amino acids in parts of genome sequences between viruses from pangolins and from humans.
The whole-genome comparison has now found about 92% of the genetic material in common with the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that theolins are intermedate host.
Microbiosis may be first diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although the confirmation is ultimatum that through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected complications or CT imaging.
One study comparing PCR with CT in Wanan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, even though less certain, with many features of the imbea in other processes of pneumonia and disease.
" Until March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that" CT should not be used to -screen for or as first-line test for COVID-19".
WHO published a number of protocols in an RNA test for SARS-CoV-2, which released the first on January 17.
The study uses a real - time reverse delivery polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be made on respiratory or blood samples.
Results are available in general for hours to several days.
In general, this analysis is conducted by rubbing the inside of the nose or by means of a therapeutic sense of humor even when rubbing the inside of the throat or throat swab can also be used. Several laboratories and needles make up astrological tests, which detect antibodies.
Up to April 6, 2020, none of them proved sufficient to be approved for widespread use.
In the US a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for the commercial use of assisted laboratories alone.
The sadistic properties of paleography and cogentized tomography (CT) of people with markings include asymmetric peripheral ground glass and absensent plet sffusions.
The Italian Radiological Society collects an international online database of estimated cases in confirmed cases.
With overlaps in other applications such as adenovirus, there is a limited certainty in COVID-19 to develop without a PCR signature.
A major study in China compared the results of the chest CT in PCR and showed that even though racing is less particular for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting a consideration of it as a warning device in areas of the epidemic.
The artificials are developed based on convolusal biological networks to see features of the microbiyo description that have both radiographs and CT.
Measures to prevent the spread of disease include maintaining general good personal hygiene, washing hands, trying to hold the eyes, nose or mouth of unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing and putting tissue straight into the garbage container.
Those who may already be infected are advised to wear a irurhiko mask to the public.
Physical distanciing has also been recommended to prevent infection, and many governments have restricted or warned against unnecessary travel to and from countries and areas affected by outbacks.
Nevertheless, the microbia reached a period of expansion in the community in large parts of the world.
This means that microbiosis is spreading within communities, and it is not known where or how they are infected by some members of the community. Health care providers who care for a person who may be infected are recommended to use standard precautions, associations, and eye protections.
Using the location data from mobile phones by governments for this wish has prompted withdrawal worries, along with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that issue a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been enforced or proposed for spontaneous use, and up to April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups work on solutions that are warm-sapribate, such as using the Blueooth to draw a neighbor to a user of other celpons.
Users can receive a message if they are close to a person who has been diagnosed as positive for COVID-19. False speculations are transferred about how to avoid implication; for example, cutting the nose and letting the mouthwash is ineffective.
COVID-19 has no vaccine, even though many organizations work to form one.
Hand washing is guaranteed to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for twenty seconds, especially after going to the moth or if the hands are visible to be dirty; before eating; and after spewing out their own nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which fires its protective bubble.
The CDC further recommended the use of alcohol - based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol according to volume when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid touching the eyes, noses, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces can be cleaned of a number of solutions (in one minute of exposure to the disinfectant for the stainless steel surface), including 62–71% ethanol, 5000% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen butxide, and 0.2 –7.5% vidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected of having a case or is confirmed in a facility such as office or day care, all places such as offices, bathrooms, general areas, electron distributions such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by human diseases, should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with their folded elbow or tissue when coughing or dropping, and immediately dispose of any tissue.
Physy masks are recommended for those who may be infected, for the use of the mask can limit the number and loss of the movement of tiny droplets while speaking, coughing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
" According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist of the University of Leeds, "" Wearing masks can reduce the habit [of] people to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene," The masks are also recommended for those who care for a person who may be sick."
WHO recommends that healthy people wear masks only when they are at high risk, such as those caring for a person with COVID-19, even though they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Some countries have begun to persuade the use of masks by public members.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China specifically recommends the use of still - growing medical masks by healthy public members, especially close - knit (1 m or 3 feet or closer) with other people.
Hong Kong recommended wearing surgical masks when riding public transportation or staying in crowded areas.
Thailand's health officials have persuaded people to make facemask cloths at home and to shave them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned public presence without wearing a mask or covering of a person's nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a face mask when going to public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government decreed that everyone entering a grocery store should wear a face mask.
Israel asked all residents to wear a face mask when outside.
Taiwan, which produces ten million masks each day since mid - March, ordered train and buses in the city to wear face masks in 1 April.
Panama has replaced wearing masks every time you go outside, while also recommending homemade masks for those who cannot afford masks.
Facial masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) is accompanied by action in controlling presection with the intent to slow down the spread of the disease by reducing close contact with indibid communities.
Ways include quarantine; travel restrictions; and closing of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or shopping centers.
Indibiders can perform long - distance methods by staying at home, picking up travel, avoiding crowded areas, using greetings without contact, and physically keeping themselves away from others.
Many governments now order or plan social distancing in regions affected by the outbreak.
The largest number of gatherings recommended by US to government representatives and health organizations has been reduced rapidly from 250 persons (if there is no known circulation of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 people, and then 10 people.
In March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings above two people. Older and infirm people such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory illness, abnormal high blood pressure, and poor immunology systems were facing the greater risk of chronic illness and complications and were advised by the CDC to stay at home as long as possible in areas of outbreaks in the community. In late March 2020, WHO and other health agents were able to replace the use of the term "sociscriptive " as it was kept in contact with the physical goal" to corrective "by compatructural means, " by extension.
" The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that people should join in total social isolation, rather than persuade them to stay in touch with others by alternative means. Some authorities have issued guidance on secondary health for use during the pandemic."
These include recommendations to have sex with someone at home who does not have the virus or the symptoms of the virus.
The separation of oneself from home is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies issued detailed instructions for the right separation. Many governments ordered or recommended self-quarantine for the entire population living in the affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions are issued for high - risk groups.
Counsel has been given to those who may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and the recent travelers to a country or region with a wide transmission to perform a self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
Control strategies for an outbreak are control or control, and cure.
Control of early stages of outbreaks and intent on identifying and separating the infected as well as to start other methods of controlling immunizations and vaccines to stop the outbreak of disease in the remaining population.
If the spread of the disease is beyond control, efforts will change during the period of reduction: steps will be taken to slow down the spread and ease its effects on the health - care system and society.
The combination of the same measures of control can be taken simultaneously injuring and lightening.
It takes control of more drastic measures to combat resistance by reducing the standard number of breeding at a below 1 outrank management of a contagious disease to try to reduce the severity of the epidemic, known as smoothing the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of excessive health services and allows more time for vaccines and treatment to develop.
The non-parmasatic interference that can govern the outbreak include personal steps in the action, such as manual hygiene, wearing mask - face, and self - qualitylines; steps in the community passing physical disanction (physical disstancing) such as closing schools and canceling events at large gatherings; associating with the community to encourage admission and participation in intersectes; as well as environmental schemes to clean the generality of China.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the outbreak.
South Korea introduced mass screens and localized quarantines, and warning warnings were given to the action of infected indibidals.
Singapore provided financial support for those who were infected and subjected themselves to quarantine and imposed a heavy fine on those who did not.
Taiwan added a face mask production and fined illegal storage of medical supplies, and the initiatives for Great Britain and the United States showed that weakening (lowening but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and crushing (reverseing epidemic growth) had the basic challenges.
Optimal healing policies may reduce the need for health care by 2/3 and death by half, but still mark hundreds of thousands of deaths and filling health systems.
Suppression or oppression may be chosen but must be maintained until the virus is spread throughout the human population (or until a vaccine is developed), for infection on the other hand will quickly return when steps are relaxed.
Long - term interference to combat resistance brings social and economic costs.

The laboratory test for respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include techniques that regulate the risk of the virus and the people who display antibodies that were created in response to the impectation.
The presence of viruses in employment is confirmed by RT-PCR, which is attached to coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and is limited to eliminating SARS-CoV-2 viruses RNA.
It is used to sign the most recent or active applications.
The discovery of antibodies can be used equally for analysis and population surveillance.
antibody tests show how many people have contracted the disease, including people whose symptoms are too simple to report or who have failed to show symptoms.
The proper mortality rate and the level of awareness of the human group in the population can be identified from the results of this study.
Because of limited testing, up to March 2020 no countries have reliable data on the spread of microbiosis in their population.
On March 23, no country examined more than 3% of their population, and there was widespread change as to how many studies had to be conducted throughout the countries.
Changing this could adversely affect the level of reported death cases, which are likely to be widely estimated in some countries.
Using real - time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing can be performed on postpirators obtained from a variety of ways, including rubbing inside the nose or nasygeal swab or employment.
The results are generally available within hours of up to 2 days.
The RT-PCR study conducted using rubbing the throats or throat swab can be expected only during the first week of illness.
In time the virus may disappear from the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people examined a second week, alternative employment material can be carried out from deep airways by means of action caster or can use a straining device.
One of the first PCR studies was developed in Charité in Berlin in January 2020 using the real-time referion polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and established a basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom also developed a study of January 23, 2020. South Korea's Kogenebiotech convention also formed a surgical grade, detection kit (PowerChek Coronavirus) for the SaRS-CoV-2 based on PCR on January 28, 2020.
" It's found "E" gene shared by all beta coronavirus, and the RdRp gene for only the SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group is one of the first patients to receive emegency permission from China's National Medical Products Administration for the draw of the SRS-Vometer's ReR.
One of the three genetic studies of older versions of test kits has produced unpleasant results due to false restorations, and a deeper check at the Atlanta CDC; it has resulted in a maximum of less than 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two ingredients were not described as reliable until February 28, 2020, and they were not until state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The study was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under Emergency Use Authorization, and U.S. commercial laboratories began a study early in March 2020.
Beginning on March 5, 2020, the LabCorp advertised the worldwide availability of a study of COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics conducted a nationwide study of CoVID-19 starting March 9, 2020.
There is no limit to quantity; collecting pepcimen and processing should be carried out according to CDC laws.
In Russia a study of COVID-19 was developed and done by the State Research Center of Virgology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the Federal Services registered the study for monitoring health care. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic reported developing a rating so that the impestectation in COVID-19 was registered. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the FDA's permission for a study that could be performed within 3.5 hours of high volume, allowing the machine to perform an estimated 4,12 hours of 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA gave an emergencyuse autorization (EUA) to the Abbot Laboratories for a study of the hydro2000 system ofbot; recently the FDA presented a similar authorization to the Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cephheid also received EUA from the FDA for a 45 - minute examination.
The FDA has approved an analysis using sothermal acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because it doesn't require a series of temperature changes cycles this method can bring positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbot expects a rise in friction to deliver 50,000 tests each day. The study using the monoclonal antibody that specifically connects the nucapsid protein (N protein) of the novel coronavirus has been developed in Taiwan, hoping that it can provide results for 15 to 20 minutes like a quick study of the flu.
" A review of literature in March 2020 confirmed that "heart radiographs have a small amount of diagnostic at an early stage, as CT [computed tomography] results can be shown even before symptoms begin."
Among CT's common features are the lateral multilobar ground-glass in poor color and peripheral, asymmetric and postrior distribution.
Subpleural domination, overpreparation and integration are developed as the disease develops.
The study comparing the CCR with the CT in Wano at the site of the current pandemic suggested that CT be more sensitive than PCR, even though less specific, where many of its emiesses are known to regulate other pneumonias and disease processes.
" From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "the CT should not be used to test or as the first row of examination to refer to COVID-19". Beginning March 2020, nor does the CDC recommend PCR for initial analysis."
Part of the response to resistance to the practice is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect indibidal interactions beginning in 7 days or mature after symptoms, to determine immunization, and to monitor population. Assys can be performed in laboratory centers (CT) or in potin-ofcre testing (PoCT).
Automed systems that have high results in many clinical laboratories can perform these assays but that their availability depends on the level of production for each system.
For CLT, a single spectrum for whole blood or peripheral blood is commonly used, even though serial patterns can be used to follow immune resistance.
For PoCT a single blood spectrum is usually extracted by skin puncturing.
Unlike PCR methods, the extraction measure was not necessary before the assy. On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 patents that gave notice to the agency as required and is therefore able to distribute their tests to their antibodies.
Beginning on April 7, 2020, only individual tests were approved by the FDA under the authorization of emergency use. In the last days of March 2020, the Euroimmmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received permission for their tests, which could be developed by IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood employment.
The capacity for testing is several hundred employment in a few hours and therefore faster than the conventional PCR assay viral RNA.
It was common to see in 14 days of antibodies after the onset of the ispection, and early April, the UK learned that there was not enough good use on the lures of the antibody test it had purchased.
" Hong Kong works out a plan in which suspected patients can stay at home, "" the emegency department will give the patient a spectrum tube", they will spit it out, return the results and get the results after a few minutes. The British NHS makes the plan forward to check suspected home cases, which eliminate the risk of infecting others if they go to the hospital or need ambulance when used by a person. In the field drive - B.
The drive-through centers helped South Korea to make some of the fastest and most extensive studies of any country. In Germany, the National Association of Staticoratory Health Insurance Physicians spoke on March 2, with a capacity of about 12,000 per day in the engineering process and 10,700 diagnosed during the first week.
The cost is due to health insurance when a doctor asks for the diagnosis.
According to the president of Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity of 160,000 annual tests.
Beginning March 19 operations while inside the vehicle were offered in large cities.
Since March 26, 2020, the total number of studies conducted in Germany is unknown, since only positive results are reported.
" The first survey revealed that beginning with the week of the calendar of 12/20 the estimated total of 483,265 was diagnosed until the week of 12/20 and 33,491 in employment (6.9%) was diagnosed as positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers were able to develop and analyze the method of checking for employment tests from 64 patients at the same time (6.9%) by collecting jobs and recomparing only by 20-U.SP) for use, which was called "U.
During the motions followed by BGI founder Wang Jian and lasting 5 days, the modelling showed cases in Hubei would be 47 higher and the equivalent cost of performing quarantine would double if the capacity of this examination did not arrive in row.
Immediately followed by Huo-Yanabs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai follow the Wan Laboratory, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
By 4 March 2020 the thyloughput tots were 50,000 tests per day.Open, multiple designed by Origami Assays have Benn release what a test as well as 1122 plusgents for COVID19 lug only 93 assalys . The weighted designs can be produced by a runner in all the labor systems at all time and for the robot examinations.
In March, shortages and inadequate organ volume became a barrier to massive EU and UK and US studies.
This has led some authors to check the probes for employment that is involved in heating employment levels at 98 ° C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to produce RNA genomes for further analysis. On March 31 the United Arab Emirates is now studying more of its population for Coronavirus per head than in other countries, and keeping up the test level to reach the large population.
" It's by a combination of driver-through ability, and by buying pulp-scale mass-throughput laborory from Group 42 and BGI (bear in their"Huo-Yan" emergency laboratories in China). "
The laboratory has the ability to perform ten thousand RT-PCR tests a day developed in 14 days and the world's leading size to operate outside China.
Various study recipes in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States have been developed in various parts of the coronavirus genetic profile.
The World Health Organization has used the German recipe for detouring kits sent to low - income countries with no resources to form their own kits.
The German recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protool developed by U.S. Centers for Disease Control for the Profusion of Disease was not available until January 28, which set aside the tests available in U.S.Cina and the United States has developed problems in the reliability of tests for early spread of the disease, and these countries and Australia have not supplied enough kits to meet the needs and recommendations for expert health tests.
On the other hand, experts say that the widespread availability of South Korea's study has helped to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The capacity for study that is mostly in private laboratory sectors has been established for nearly a few years through the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization was called upon to start programs as the best way to slow down the growing pandemic COVID-19. The high level of screening because of the widespread spread of the virus that brought in thousands of tests in the private laboratories of the U.S., and the suppliers of the swab and chemical substance failed.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of their test kits.
" In the United States, there are "symps" the kits of the CDC; so the government removed the prucracy barriers that prevented private testing, and Spain bought stings from the Chinese company Shenzhen Boioeasy Biotechnology C Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate".
The confirmation explained that the wrong results may be the result of miscalculation or misuse of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said that it would remove the kits that had returned the wrong results, and it would be replaced by other tests given by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the tests purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong result. Slovakia bought 1.2 million tests from China that were known to be inaccurate.
" Prime Minister Matovič suggests that it should be discarded on the Danube, andş Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry says that the test kits that Turkey purchased from China had an "high degree of glances" and they didn't" use them. "
Checking, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those who met with positive people at SARS-CoV-2, who worked out positive results.
Researchers working in the town of Vò, the area of the first to die in COVID-19 in Italy, conducted twice as many a study of the entire population of about 400 people, with ten days apart.
About half of the people tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found came under quarantine.
Traveling the restricted area, it completely reduces new emissions.
By means of aggressive monitoring of the relationship, restricting incoming travel, testing, and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus countery in Singapore continued slowly beyond other developed countries, but there were no severe restrictions such as forced closing of restaurants and tingi establishments.
Many developments were canceled, and Singapore began by urging residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened on leave of vacation on March 23.
Some of the other countries have managed the practice by means of vigorous contact trade, international travel bans, studies, and quarantine, but there is a lower aggressive lockdown, such as Iceland and South Korea.
The statistics made it clear that countries that have much investigations, associated with the death toll, have lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries are more capable of causing minor symptoms or lack symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without testing skills and a national laboratory with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 in one of WHO's 16 reference laboratories for a signed study.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 are in Euopa, 2 are in Afrika, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column "Positative as % of tests" is influenced by the country's screening policy.
The country that studies only people admitted to hospitals will have more positive %s of tests than the country that studies all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other things of fairness.
Handwashing (or handwashing), also known as rules of maintaining hand hygiene (hand hygiene), is an act in cleaning up their own hands for the desire to remove the soil, grease, microorganisms, or other undesirable ingredients.
" To keep washing hands with soap in certain "critical situations" during the day inhibits the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are passed along by the route from dirt to mouth."
People with respiratory diseases such as flu or common colds, for example, can also be infected if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouth (it's the mucous membranes).
Five critical moments in the days that it is important to scatter hands include: before and after coughing, after cleaning the baby's ass or changing diapers, before feeding the child, before eating and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
Without water and soap, the hands can be cleaned out of ash, and the World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during, and after preparing a meal.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After replacing the child with diapers or cleaning.
After you sneeze, cough or sneeze.
After touching the animal, animal food, or animal dung.
My medical hand hygiene refers to health - care habits associated with medical procedures.
Washing one's hands before administering medication or medical care can stop or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary medical purpose for washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens, microbes, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or diseases.
This is especially important to those who conduct food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important skill for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; inhibiting infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and lower infant mortality in domestic births.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand washing can bring a little improvement in the height of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, the number of dying young people who have to do with breathing and diarrhea may be reduced by the onset of simple changes in behavior, such as washing their hands with soap.
This simple action may reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by about 50%.
The devices that improve hand washing may reduce a third of diarrheal events, and this can be compared to giving clean water in low - paying areas.
48% of diarrheal emissions can be linked to the scattering of hands. The scattering of hands is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as automatic behavior done in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years of age, who rob the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia account for about 3.5 million deaths of children every year.
According to UNICEF, if it is customary to swallow hands before eating and after a bath it can save more lives than a vaccine or medical intervention, reducing the death rate from diarrhea by about half and dying from chronic respiratory infections by a quarter of an one quarter.
Hand washing is often accompanied by other sanitary interference as part of water, sanitation and sanitation or water, in nousion and hygiene (WASH) programs.
Handwashing also protects against immune transport by means of direct physical contact.
A small side effect of washing hands is that constant washing of hands can lead to skin damage caused by skin contact.
The 2012 Danish study found that too much handwashing can cause a dirty, peeling skin but also a condition known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health care workers.
Too often hand washing has also been seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive - compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five golden days on the day when washing hands with soap is important in order to reduce the transmission of fecal-oral disease; after using the bathroom (discuration, contamination), after cleaning the baby's coat (replacement), before feeding the child, before eating and before/mulating food or handling raw meat, fish or poultry.
At other times when the right method of hand washing should be trained for preventing the transmission of the disease that covers the new and completes the treatment of cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or chewing your nose; after touching animal dung or touching animals; and after touching the garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of hand washing using soap.
A study of hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that in the average, 38.7% of houses were traditionally hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rates of 97 percent; the United States was close to the center with 77 percent; and China had a minimum of 23 percent. Some of those who were able to change behaviors now had the wisdom of washing hands with dangerous soap.
" The "Essensial Health Care Program" imposed by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of timely action to promote the health and education of children."
Beating twice a year, wiped out hands daily with soap, brushing your teeth with fluorie, is in the middle of this national program.
It was also successfully carried out in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin has been increased by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce solution barriers, and increase the ability to digest.
Water alone cannot be effectively cleaned because fats and proteins do not mix easily with water, where they are parts of organic soil.
Cleaning up, however, is assisted by the logical flow of water.
Solid soap can be obtained from earlier uses, thanks to its reusable properties.
A small number of studies that look at the translation of germs from contaminated whole soap have concluded that the transfusion is uncertain because the tubery has been rinsed with foam.
" The CDC further observes that the "roid soap that doesn't need to be handled for release is more desirable"""".
Bactery soaps have become highly promoted in public health - related substances.
Today, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptic or disinfectant is chosen for antibiotic - resistant organisms in its nature.
However, soaps that are contrary to bactery contain such common agents as triclosan, with an extensive list of untainted forms of organisms.
Thus, even if the antibiotic resin strins are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are traded.
Besides surfactant and skin - protection agent, sophisticated formulas (acotic acid, ascobic acid, lactic acid) may contain acids as pH reguor, antimicrobily active benzoic acid and additional skin conditioning (aloe vera, vitamin, mentol, plant juices) I suggest a comprehensive analysis from the School of Public Health (Shool of Public Health) of the professor that simple soaps are as effective as a confacterculates of soap.
Hot water that is comfortably washed with hands is not hot enough to kill the washter.
The bacteria increase rapidly in body temperature (37 ° C).
The hot, doughy water, however, is more effective than the cold, doughy water in removing natural oils from which to stay soils and mortars.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on the reduction of pathogens in the hands.
One hand sanitizer or manual antiseptic is an ingredient in waterproofing hands.
In the latter part of the 1990 ' s and early 21th century, hand - washing manual - alcohol agents began to gain prominence (also known as wet-alkol hand washers, antiseptic handwashers, or handwashers).
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol, which is outlined by such increasing agents as Carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) to produce a gel, or a humect such as glycerin to make a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the effect of alcohol plumbing.
Adding stopped hydrogen-butxide adds more activity against the germ. Hand sanitizers containing the lowest 60% to 95% alcohol are effective disinfectants.
Alcohol - based salizers kill bactery, multidrug resinist bactia (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (such as HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanizers containing 70% alcohol that kills 99.97% (3.5 log reaction, partners in reducing 35 decibels) of the batteria in 30 seconds after the installation and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reaction) of the bactery in the hands 1 minute after the installation. The handnitizers were completely effective countertakers and were ineffective to some microbes.
Alcohold - based hand sanitizers are virtually all ineffective against norovirus (or Norwak) kinds of microbes, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. The average amount of hand antiseptic or palm alcohol must be used to fully break or control both hands.
The front and back of the two hands and between and the tips of all the fingers are pulled about 30 seconds until the liquid, bubbles, or gels dry.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed with good, with both palms. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing more than sandizers, especially when the hands are visible to be dirty.
The rising use of these agents is based on their easy use and rapid activity of killing against micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Regular use of alcohol - based hand sanitizers can cause a dryness of the skin unless the softeners and/o moisturizers of the skin are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/o other stimulants to the core.
In clinical tests, alcohol - based hand sanitizers containing softeners have caused a whole of less skin irritations and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contactrarchia syndrome or excessive alcohol intolerance or additives present in alcohold hand rubs rarely occur.
A lower tendency to speed irritant contact dermatitis has become an infusion compared with washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, nonwater agents do not clean organic material in the hands, but they are simply disinfected.
This explains why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many causes of disease, for the causes of disease remain in the hands.
The power of alcohol - free hand sanitizer is heavily dependent on ingredients and formulas, and in history it is important to be less effective than alcohol and platifications.
More recently, formulas using benzalkonium chloride have shown that there is a recurring and accumulated activity against germs after anointing, not like alcohol, that shows a decline in effect after repeated use, perhaps because of progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low - paying communities cannot buy soap and instead use ash or land.
The ash or soil may be more effective than water alone, but it may be less effective than soap.
One concern is whether microorganisms infect soil or ash that may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is a disinfectant agent caused by water contact, it becomes a medicinal solution.
WHO uses soot or sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct method of hand washing is recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control for controlling the transmission of disease that covers the following steps:
Wash hands with hot or cold running water.
Staying water is recommended because well - watered water can be contaminated, as water temperatures seem to make no difference.
Splatter soap into the hands by rubbing them with the full amount of soap, including the wrunging of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap lifts germs out of the skin, and studies show that people behave hard to wash their hands when using soap rather than water.
Rub for 20 seconds.
Splaking creates friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing too long eliminates more germs.
Wash well under running water.
Stringing the plangull can rewarte the hands.
Dry with a clean towel or allow the air to dry.
The wet, sweating hands are easier to pick up, and the most widely neglected areas are thumb, pulse, locations between fingers, and under nails.
The artificial nails and nail pigments that have a hard substance can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended for preventing dry hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of passing infection.
" A variety of inexpensive options can be made to facilitate hand washing in which tap and/o soap water cannot be used. Pouring water from hanging jerrycan or gourds with suitable holes and/o use of ash if needed in developing countries, in situations where there are limited water supplies (such as schools or lunches in developing countries), there are water conservation solutions, "" tips" and other inexpensive options. "
The tippy-tap is a simple technology with a bottle hanging on a rope, and a foot - made lever to pour a little water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the clean - hand process, but there are some debates in the most important form of drying public dishes.
A growing amount of research suggests that towel paper is cleaner than the decoryte hand drys seen in many bathrooms.
In 2008 a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry, to compare the level of hygiene offered by paper towels, hot - air hand dryers, and the more modern jet-air handers.
After washing and drying hands with hot - air dryer, the total number of batteries was calculated to have increased on average over the fingers by 194% and on palms by 254%.
Drying with jet-air dryer has caused an average increase in the total number of washteres on the fingers by 42% and palms by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with paper towels, the total number of dishes was reduced on average on the surfaces of the finger by up to 76% and on palms by up to 77%. The scientists also conducted tests to see if there was potential contamination by others who used the wash basin and the environment as a result of every kind of drying process.
The jet-air dryer, where air is released from a unit with a speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can blow the microorganisms from the hands and the unit and possibly catch other people using the bathroom and the bathroom environment up to 2 feet [2 m] away.
Using warm-air hand dryer will spread microorganisms up to 0.25 feet [25 m] from dryer.
Paper towels showed no significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study made by TUV Productund und Umuwelt, a different method of drying hands was suspected.
The following changes in battery numbers after drying hands were observed:
Many various hand dryers exist, and hand dryers are compared against drying paper towels.
Washing hands with hand cleaners was an alternative while traveling without soap and water.
There must be at least 60% alcohol for an alcohol alcohold hand sanitizer.
Medical hand washing was mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semelweis discovered the effectiveness (in 1846) of preventing disease in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital staff of washing their hands if they forget.
One study found out the declining infection rates for their use.
Medical hand washing is for the lowest 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to foam and rub each part of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed into all its parts.
If dirt is present under the nail, the teeth of the brush can be used to remove it.
Because germs can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to rinse thoroughly and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, paper towels should be used for killing water (and for opening any exit door if necessary).
It avoids reuncleaning hands from those paved lines.
The reason for washing hands in health care is for eliminating pathogenic microorganisms ("mims") and avoiding their spread.
The New England Journal of Medicine reported that the lack of hand washing remained in unacceptable levels in almost all medical areas, with large numbers of doctors and nurses often forgetting to wash their hands before patients touched them, thus spreading microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple techniques could lower the number of blood - vessel infections related to the catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a paper showing conventional hand washing and hand rubbing in the health - care sectors.
The plan to guide the health - care guidelines of the organization's hand may also appear on his website for public commentary.
A related review was made by Whitby et al.
Commercial equipment can measure and prove the rule of hand health care, if it is necessary to demonstrate the observance of the regulation.
" The World Health Organization has a "Soon" for washing hands:"
after exposure to blood/body fluids
before an aseptic work, and
After the patient's care, the addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicated" or "antiicrobial" soaps) can pay the killer action on a hand-washing agent.
Such an act of killing may be in demand before performing surgery or in places where antiactive organisms are prevalent, with chlorhexidine or iodine to wash, sterilized scrub for rubbing and a sterile instrument for cleaning under the hands.
All jewelry must be removed.
This method requires washing hands and arms up to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
A long period of rubbing (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When rinsed, the water in the arms had to be prevented from returning to the hands.
After hand washing is completed, the hands are washed with clean cloth and the surgical gown is worn.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash hands or use an antiseptic for the hand before or after caring for a sick person.
For control of staphylococical infections in hospitals, it was known that the greatest benefits from hand cleaning came from the first 20% of washing, and very little additional benefits were obtained by 35% of hand cleaning.
Washing with common soap results in more than triple levels of infectious food - transmitted washer disease than washing hands with a counter-battery soap. The comparison of the hand with an alcohol solution with washing hands with a counterwash soap for the median time 30 seconds showed each one that rubbing the hand of alcohol reduced contamination at 26% more than counterwashing soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohold-bunked hand frictions for reducing H1N influenza A germ and Clostridium difficle spores from the hands. By improving hand - care rules in health care environments may need education for hand washing personnel, by ensuring that an alcobared handb is available, and by the staff written and word.
There is a need for more research into which is most effective in various health settings.
In developing countries, the scattering of hands is recognized as an economical, vital tool for achieving good health, and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable supplies of water, soap or hand - washing facilities in people's homes, in schools and in the workplace, makes it a challenge to achieve the general habit of washing hands.
For example, most of Africa's farm taps for washing hands near each private or public toilet are not enough, even when inexpensive options are available to make hand - washing stations.
However, low levels of hand washing can also result from routine behavior than from lack of soap and water.
The promotion and enjoyment of hand washing with soap can influence customs, lift awareness of hand - washing benefits and lead to long - term changes in population behavior.
For it to work effectively, rulership and interference are needed.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that commercialized methods were effective in increasing hand washing of LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. One example for promoting handwashing in schools is "Three Star Appeal" of UNICEF encouraging schools to take simple, inexpensive measures in ensuring students to wash their hands with soap, other health needs.
Once the minimum standard has been met, schools can move from one to the largest number of three stars.
Building hand - washing establishments can be part of hand - washing campaigns that are carried out to reduce the child's health and death.
The Day of the Worldwide Hand Washing is an example of the raising up of this conscious campaign trying to achieve mood change. As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF began adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Very few studies have considered the total effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in connection with DALYs who have been prevented.
One rebyu, however, suggests that promoting hand washing with soap is more economical than other water and sanitation interference.
The importance of washing hands for human health - -- particularly for people in poor condition such as mothers who were recently born or wounded soldiers in hospitals - -- was first chained in the mid -19th century by two hand - care creators: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semelweis, who worked in Vienna, and Florence Naightingale, the English "construer of modern care.
At that time most people still believed that infections were caused by a bad smell called masmas.
In 1980, outbreaks of eating and health disorders combined with infections gave way to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in more active support of hand health care as an important means of curbing the spread of infection.
The spread of swine flu in 2009 and the County COVID-19 in 2020 led to an increase in awareness of the importance of washing hands with soap in many countries to protect oneself from such infectious diseases.
For example, signs with "hand washing methods right" hang next to the sink for washing hands in public toilets and in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The term "washing the hands of" one thing, that is to say that it is hard to feel responsible for a matter or sharing a conspiracy with it.
It was from the biblical copy of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands by having Hesu Christ crucified, but it became a phrase with greater use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to force her hands to wash in an attempt to clean up the imagined stain, which represented her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she committed and encouraged her husband to commit.
It has also been acknowledged that people, after learning or thinking about the nonethicals, have the tenensan to wash their hands more often than others, and tend to value washing equipment more.
Also, people who have been allowed to wash their hands after the above reflection are not too likely to participate in other "cleaning " acts, such as volunteering.
The churches recommend hand washing for the same purity and symbolic purposes, which is symbolic washing of hands, using water but without soap in washing hands, is part of the ritual of washing hands that has been featured in many religions, including the Belief Bahá'í, Hinduism, Shivilah and netilatoyim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Whu in Islam.
Hindusism, Judaism and Islam order hand washing after using the bathroom.
And, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam order the washing of hands before or after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards for COVID-19
Danger controls for the COVID-19 are applications of methods for job safety and health for risk controls in combating coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper control of the danger in the workplace depends on the worksite and work function, based on checking the risk of infections, the severity of community disease, and risk factors of indibid workers who may be too weak to infect COVID-19.
According to the U.S. according to the U.S. Office's Official Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with low exposure to danger have very little public performance and other colleagues, where the basic control of impestion is recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they have a disease, a repiratory standard, and maintaining routine cleaning and cleaning of the work environment.
People with less risky jobs may need frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but there may be interference due to community transmission or international travel.
These include workers with general public contacts such as schools, high - density work environments, and some of the high - volume retail sites.
Control of the danger for this group includes, in addition to methods of major control of impestation, ventilation by high - powered air filters, antidiscipital barriers, and personal protective equipment that could be used in case of contact with a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers the health - care workers and funeral workers exposed to a well - known or suspicious person with COVID-19 with a risk of high exposure, which increases the high risk of exposure if workers engage in aerosol - producing techniques, or collect or collect patterns from a well - known or suspected person with COVID-19.
Among the danger controls appropriate for these workers are engineering controls such as ventilation in the room with a negative precision, and personal protection equipment suitable for work function.
The spread of COVID-19 may have some of the effects inside the workplace.
Workers may miss work because of illness, which needs to care for others, or the fear of infection.
Businesstters can change, both when it comes to what is demanded, and the way these goods are obtained (such as shopping during hours of rush or by means of delivery or by drive-through service).
Finally, items sent from geographic areas seriously affected by COVID-19 may be stopped. The preparation for infectious disease and planned sales can be used to guide protective actions.
Plans are responding to levels of danger associated with various workers and work duties, including sources of exposure, risk factors resulting from home and community areas, and risk factors of indibid workers such as aging or chronic medical manipulation.
It also outlines the controls needed to meet those dangers, and plans come what may for situations that may appear as a result of the spread of the disease.
The readiness for infectious disease and debate plans may come under national and nationalistic recommendations.
The purposes of focusing on the spread of the disease include reducing personnel infection, protecting people at high risk for bad health complications, maintaining business operations, and reducing the adverse effects on other patents in their suppliers.
The severity of the disease in the community where the business is located has affected sales.
The hierarchy of risk controls is the framework widely used for safety at work and health to group risk controls according to curiosity.
Where the dangers of COVID-19 can be eliminated, the most important controls are engineering control, followed by administrative control, and the latter by protective equipment.
Engineersing controls involve isolating employees from work - related hazards without relying on worker behavior, and may be the most economical solution to implementation.
Administration controls are changed in employment policy or procedures that require a worker's action or employer.
Personal proteive equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative control, but it can help prevent some of the exposures.
All kinds of PPE should be chosen on the basis of danger to the worker, who is well adapted if possible (e.e., breathators), who are constantly and appropriately worn, often checked, maintained, and replaced, if necessary, and who are appropriately removed, cleaned, stored or discarded to prevent contamination.
According to the U.S. according to the U.S.
Babylonian methods of controlling impestation have been recommended for all places of work for frequent and thorough washing of hands, urging workers to stay at home if they have a disease, respiratory skills included covering the mouth when coughing and sneezing, providing a container of tissues and debris, preparing for home - related television or shifts that have time between, forbidding workers to use tools and equipment, and keeping frequent cleaning and disinfectants around the work.
A quick recognition of and separation of potential contraceptives is an important step in protecting workers, chefs, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of chronic respiratory illness stay at home until their fevers disappear, fever signals, and any other symptoms of about 24 hours without the use of a fever - lowerer or other drugs that lose symptoms, and the identification policies can be changed, allow employees to stay at home to care for a family member, and these employees know of the procedure.
According to OSHA, jobs with low - risk exposure include those who need frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are unknown or suspected of being patients of COVID-19, but SRS-COV-2 may be checked because of community transmission throughout the business area, or because the indibidal recently has a worldwide trip to the area with a wide range of CODVI.
Among these are workers with general public control such as schools, a high - population work environment, and some of the retailing sites with high volume. Engineering control and high - risk groups may include installing air filters with high efficiency, adding ventilation levels, installing physical barriers such as a clear - plastic diving shield, and denying a record - intensity drive window for mercus.
Workers in this threatened group rarely need to use respirators.
If a person gets sick in an airplane, including proper control to protect workers and other passengers from breaking the sick within 6 feet, assigning a member of the crew to serve the sick person, and offering a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should wear uncomfortable medical gloves when caring for a sick tripro or handling body fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces, and it may be additional personal protective equipment if the sufferer has a fever, a recurring cough, or difficulty breathing.
Bites and other waste items should be thrown into a biohazard bag, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial shipping, including sailing ships and other passenger vehicles, risk controls include delays in travel when sick, and isolation and instant awareness of the ship's medical center when one develops fever or other symptoms during a ship's cargo.
It is better for the medical foldups to take place in the isolated human room, for schools and child - care facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closing for cleaning and disinfecting if the infected person comes from the school building regardless of the extent of the community.
When there are small to moderate community transmissions, disks can be conducted in social distancing such as the canceling of field trips, appendix, and other large gatherings such as physical education or types of choirs or food in a cafeteria, rising space between tables, not simultaneously arriving and leaving, begging the unimportant visitor, and using a separate location of the health office for children with symptoms such as flu.
If there is a large transmission to the local community, in addition to social diving strategies, the extended closing of the school may be respected. For the law - enforcement staff in the daily routine of activity, the urgent health risks are considered below the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who should connect with individals who are confirmed or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow the same rules as those of medical technicians, including suitable personal protection equipment.
When close contact occurs or near hospital time, workers must clean and disinfect their ducty belts and gear before reuse the spray or purvey household cleaning, and follow the usual methods of operating for storage and washing clothes.
OSHA considers certain health - care and funeral workers in a high or very high category of danger in exposure.
High - risk jobs include transmitting health care, support, laboratory, and medical workers exposed to the unknown or suspected patients of COVID-19.
This becomes an extremely high risk of exposure when workers adopt aerosol - based techniques, or collecting or management of Speimen from known or suspected patients of COVID-19.
aerosol - production techniques include intubation, cough - speeding techniques, bronchoscopy, some dental operations and tests, or collecting infectious spectrum.
Among those with high exposure to the risk of funeral work are workers involved in the care of human bodies who have been informed or suspected cases of CoVID-19 at the time of their death; these become high risks when they perform autopsies. Additional engineering control for these groups threatens are isolated rooms for patients who know or suspect COVID19, which includes the practice of aerosol production.
Specialized negative ventilation may fit some health care and funeral arrangements.
Spepcimens should be managed by Level 3 to keep Biosafty.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that future patients be separated from the designated waiting sites depending on whether they were the case of the suspected COVID-19. In addition to other PPE, OSHA recommends breathingators for people who work within 6 feet known to have, or suspected SRS-CoV2 infection, and people who are conducting techniques for processing aerosol.
In the United States, the N95 survival shield of the face - to - face breathators approved by NOSH or better should be used in the context of comprehensive, written respiratory protection programs including checking for appropriate, training, and medical tests.
Other kinds of breathators can provide higher protection and improve the relief of the worker. WHO doesn't recommend spices because COVID-19 is inhaled disease than is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO recommends only surgical masks for staffmen at the entrance.
For collectors of breathing specimens from, protection for, or transfer patients of COVID-19 with no techniques of composition, WHO recommends irurhic mask, goggles, or facial shield, toga, and gloves.
If a method is developed by ang-aerosol, a N95 or FFP2 breathator will replace the irurhiko mask.
Because PPE's global supply supply is inadequate, WHO Inrekumenates that the need for PPE is reduced through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, those in direct care allow only to enter a room with a patient of COVID-19, using only PPE as needed for work, to continue using the same property without leaving it while caring for many patients who have the same method, to monitor and to monitor the suit.

SUBJECT: [Covid-19] Easing the load and preparing for the future
SEND DATE/TIME: 14 March, 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENSING: CC0: No rights reserved
We see ourselves in the striking situation of this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that removes our worldwide attachment to man and the responsibilities that we have toward one another.
We did not meet its challenges, but we knew that our best response depended on the kind of international compassion, cooperation, and community construction.
The village and maintenance that we see among all our colleagues by means of email, call, and chat are striking proof of the wonderful people who have been fortunate enough to be with us.
I will not be more thankful and proud to consider you all as companions.
Last week, someone shared our work with me in appreciation.
They reminded me of how important it is for the world to turn to Wikipedia today, and what a powerful symbol it is to keep this precious source online and available to all.
This makes your job possible, whether it is keeping places alive or paying for our associates or making our communities safe.
The world needs information provided by Wikpedi today more than ever before.
This is the moment in which not only what we do but also how we do it will have a meaningful effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your duty here, we will make some meaningful arrangements for how we can cooperate, beginning in the coming week.
Adapting to our work and schedules
Like those mentioned earlier, cteam met last night to discuss our method and schedule for the days and months to come.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization alive at this time.
We desperately wanted to eliminate stress and support our long - term mission.
If you need to call again, that's all right.
For all staff, contractors, and labor contracts:
Our daily work prospects will be 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week to further understanding.
We don't declare holidoy - if you can work more normal hours, you can be used by a mission.
The world, however, is not so smart today, and if you need to care for your loved ones, shop for grocery, or go to the doctor, let us give your interests priority.
We don't watch your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It must go without saying a word, but we say it.
There is no need for days of absence due to illness or simply to tell your overseer and to help your team adjust calendars and schedules to ensure that major workplaces are subject.
( If you are diagnosed positive for COVID-19, please let Bryan wihin Tzamp;Cops know so THamp;C can welp support and sure your stution gets appriumte and detention management management management management management).
The personnel who work every hour will be paid in full.
We have already said, and promise again to honor our promises to our contractors and co - personnel who are paid for the hour's work.
Each one would be paid for their usual period of tricalation at the time of the usual condition.
These include whether you are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we'll take advantage of you.
People use work as a means of eliminating their stress from the world around us.
Our activities are very enjoyable, especially at times like these.
Again, it's about your self - care.
Our pledge is to speak with your overseer, that we may know what to expect and be able to keep up.
Some of the jobs are considered important.
There are some things we should keep on doing.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust &amp; Safety, and Funding teams (sing orthers) do critical work workshat have a net support.
We began the process with all the departments to evaluate current purposes and to move our attention to helping with what was important for our mission.
There is much that we can do for all, but we should focus on the most expensive project.
Today's slowdown doesn't hurt.
We did not plan to " double the time to catch up" at the end of the pandemic.
You are not expected to work extra hours to meet deadlines that are not now realistic.
We accept that circumstances change, and work to set new targets and timelines when appropriate.
What happened to APP (International Planning or Annual Planning)?
To fit our new reality and day - to - day employment expectations, we wanted to fit the timeline for the delivery of our Yearbook Plan of 202020-2021.
Our objective is to provide an extension of our 2019-20 plans that allows more time for budgeting to allow employees to give priority to important jobs, self - care, and care to loved ones while caring for those who need or want to work to reduce schedules for the next few weeks.
The extending of this timeline dramatically reduces current planning of the number of jobs and preschools in the entire organization.
We would introduce our proposal to the Governing Body the following week and date to delegates and teams at the next steps during the time we had a signature.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership.
Office Status, exposure, and cleaning
One week we learned that one of our associates from SF might have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In addition to many warnings, however, we took a worker to clean up against contamination to disinfect all the surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They use a solution against the spread that fits the hospital level to disinfect each surface, as well as the hallway and elevator floors that reach our floor.
Building its own duty uses the protective prokol to use products that support the safety of their tenants.
We felt comfortable that the office would be ready if we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has now distributed its bow in COVID-19 to us and to all the personnel on the DC.
Starting last week, our DC office was changed to a completely remote setup according to the guidance shared in San Francisco.
Because some of our colleagues on NYC were already aware of our presence, we also discussed the location renting in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue but may be delayed.
Some of our associates worked long distances for the first time.
Our colleagues know that it can be an adjustment, and some of the suggestions want to offer you:
Limit the length of the meetings to an hour or two high.
If a longer session is needed, consider how they will be separated throughout the course of several days.
It is clear to describe the meeting, to have a sayenda, and to forward material reading material.
Make the video standard, with sprouts such as Google Docs and Zoom to engage in live cooperation and connection.
Take the lead in handling each meeting, a chat monitor for questions and monitoring the speaker's list, and a person who will help record (or make help in recording).
Send email to the tech supppot if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your mood reimburg basement for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the work distribution
HR Operations consult the guidance of ergonomics based on webinar to support the increase in distribution throughout the Foundation.
This past ligo we asked all those who would receive a gift from the community to cancel the public events that were held --Wikimedia, such as the edited, until WHO declared the pandemic over.
We let them know that we understood that our request for cancel and other restrictions could make it impossible to review their activities agreed upon to allow and that no one would be punished for having delayed or changed those purposes.
In the coming week we would turn down for further guidance in Wimiania and other regional and regional confessional themes of the community.
The general sentiment throughout the world community seems to be loneliness over the devastation but relief from the clarification and the ability to focus on their communities, Witchedia and others.
Continuing, CRT works to make a page at MetaWiki to provide space for the community to monitor the effect and follow our communication with them.
Staying in contact around related issues in COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 T for special staff meetings.
We will use this time to share updates, to answer your questions and spend hours connecting each other.
We're here together and here to help out whatever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to look for information from this mail, and all the other important information related to COVID-19, at Wiki's Office.
CRT will keep these pages up - to - date and place all the information in one location.
We also work to maintain regular communications with personnel living in countries that are presently widely affected.
If you have questions about travel, convention, or major work currents, coverage challenges, or whatever you may need help, don't be nervous and cooperate with CRT.
We're here to help support and connect if necessary.
If you have a psychological or sensitive problem, please mail to Bryan Judah - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes were to be seen as taking care of our work and obligations.
Instead, they recognize that at this moment our work and obligations will likely have to adapt in a way that we are not in the past.
Here are steps that we believe are needed to support each other so that we can continue to work, provide our action with the help they need, and serve the world they hope for.
Our planned work was waiting for us on time.
Now it is time to help one another and create space for the important work to come in the weeks and potential months to come.
We need all of you to do so, and therefore we need all of you to care for yourself and your families so that you are best off when there is a need.
So now please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Awda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and in addition to the Gurant I (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N) Order.
The b'Aninoton-cognising ensimo 2 (ACE2) is a ensimo attached to the outer surface (cellal membranes) of the arteries of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 counters the activity of the associated cinotantin- linking enzyme (ACE) by reducing the number of cinotentin-III and increasing The(1-7) that makes it a reliable target for treating cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entrance to cells for some coronavirus.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
The cinotonized enzyme 2 is a zinc containing metalloenzyme found on top of the tutohelial and other selyulas.
The protein of ACE2 contains a N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and a C-terminal colctrin nal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a pale-pass type I protein membrane, along with the enzymatic active dominoyo that is exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is peeled from transmembrane domain through another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting melting protein is released into the bloodstream and is finally released into the urine.
ACE is present inst organs: ACE is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of the main lung type II alveorlar cells, enterytes of the small intestine, artery and ventous tutelial cells and arterially smooth muscle cells in most organs.
The expression ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The key role of ACE2 is to act as a preventive balance for ACE.
The ACE separates the cinotin I hormone from posoconstricting cinotes II.
ACE2 splits a carboxyl-terminal ao acid phenylanmine from cinotin II (Asp-Arg-Tyr-Ile-His-Pr-Phe) and sets it chydrolise in the vindoron (1-7), (H-App-Arignig-Val-Tyr-LIe-PO).
ACE2 can also split some peptides with [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, cynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also controls bankruptcy in the membrane of neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is linked with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as the main point of entering the selyulas for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
In particular, there is a reaction to endoctosis and translocation of the same microbiyo and enzyme in endosomes found within cells that exist in the spike S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic domain of the ACE2 above the cells.
This process of entry also requires preparation of S protein through the host serine protease TMPRS2, control of where it is under current inspection asrapeutic, which has led some to conclude that reducing the levels of ACE2, in cells, may be helpful in combating ection.
Nevertheless, many professional societies and bodies of regulation plan the continuation of the standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
" A systematic study and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors is related to a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared with controls."
" Furthermore, "the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced to patients treated by ACE inhibitors at higher risk of pneumonia, particularly stroke and heart failure."
" The use of ACE inhibitors is also linked to a reduction in pneumonia - related mortality, although the results are less stable than the general risk of pneumonia."
The recontort human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a new drug for lung damage, and it seems that pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen in the process of corrections in pigiks with lipolysaccharide-induced Aute respiratory intolerance syndrome.
The half - life of the rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the start of the move is 30 minutes in addition to the 24 - hour course of effect.
A number of findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a reliable drug for offenders in classic renantin-aponotes system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which the flow of ciolentin II is high. The Infed rhACE2 has been diagnosed in clinical tests for treating acute retators syndrome.
" B'COVID's applications are applications of mobile software designed to help monitor association in response to the County coronavirus 2019-20, hal. the process of identifying people ("contracts") that may have associated with infected indibid."
Many applications were developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdation.
Several frames were formed for the formation of apps at the entrance.
Concerns have increased with privacy, especially about systems based on monitoring the geographic location of app user.
Less disturbing alternatives include the use of baoot signals to trap a user's access to other surgical devices.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apine jointly announced that they would combine the motion to support the mottooth-loaded applications directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China the government of China, in cooperation with Alipay, set up app that allows citizens to see if they were in contact with people with COVID-19.
Using it in more than 200 cities of China, Singapore uses app called TracyTogether.
" The App is formed by the local IT community, which is issued as an open oracle and given to the government, North Macedonia launchs the "StopKorona!", application based on the Bloot to detect exposure of infected fillings and to give rapid response to health - care authorities."
App of the Ministry of Communication and Technology (Misitation of Communication and Technology) and the Health Ministry (Misitary of Health) was developed.
As far as April 14, 2020, the Google Play Store and App Store's app is waiting.
" On April 12, the government said that the monitoring of the link is in the name - making period, and could be used for expansion in a few weeks. There was a similar application in Ireland, and in France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand consider the applications based on Singapore's Trace and protokol BlueTrace. It is Russia's purpose to introduce a geofencingpp for patients who are deceived with COVID-19 living in Moscow, which is designed to ensure that they will not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of random practical problems in app system, along with wrong positives and a lack of effectiveness if app is limited to a small portion of the population.
" Responding to worries about the spread of misleading or applieds of the harmful "coronavirus", stick to limits which types of organizations can add related applications to its App Store, limiting them to" just" or if not reputable organizations. "
Google and Amazon imposed similar restrictions.
The campaigners announced the privacy of their concerns on the implications of monitoring the masses using coronavirus apps, especially on whether the creature monitoring data to deal with the coronavirus's pandemic would disappear when the threat passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of monitoring.
Organizations have expressed eight conditions on government projects:
" It is necessary" to be legally, important and proportional "" to keep on the watch;"
Extensions of monitoring and monitoring need to have a definite expiration date;
the use of data must be limited to the purposes of COVID-19;
data security and ananimo should be protected and shown protected on the basis of science;
digital surveillance should avoid being overly prejudiced and left out;
any distribution of data to third parties must be referred to by law;
There must be defenses against abuse and civil rights to respond to abuses;
"" purposeful partying by's "relevant staeholders"" would be required, including hat of public health exits and marginised groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter dene Grenzen) (RSF) is asued checklist."
The proposed plan of Google/Apple plans to meet the problem by keeping track by removing the monitoring mechanism from their device's operating systems as soon as it is no longer needed.
Some countries are using site - based digging rather than appliances, removing the same need to download app and the ability to prevent running.
In Israel, reference to the network was approved.
network - based solutions with access to raw data at the site have important potential problems for privacy.
Nevertheless, not all central servers systems have to have access to data for personal location; some mobile systems have been created that use only central servers for intercommunication (see bottom section).
In South Korea a non-long-app system has been used to accomplish the monitoring of contact.
Instead of using a dedicated app, the system gathered information from various sources that included digging data from a mobile device and data from a transaction card, and combined them to form text messages in pop messages infected by infected intruders.
Adding to the use of this information to alert possible links, the public has also made information available to the location, something that is permitted by major changes in information - distribution laws after the MERS outbreak has occurred in that country.
This information can be used in public through a number of applications and websites. The nations include Germany for the use of the same centralized and maintenance systems.
Until April 6, 2020, details have not been released.
Tracturing the contracturing is a well - established concept, with a large body of research literature beginning in 2013. In the mid-7th of April 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts were working on solutions that recognized privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to achieve the closeness of a user with other mobile phones.
However, PEP-PT is an effort by coordination that contains the same centralized and decentralized techniques, and not a single protokol. Descentralized probes include Desentralized Tracks That Maintain Distantiate Distantance (D-PPT / DP-3T), Temporary Numberes of Contact (T.
Of these protocols, data that detects personal identity will never be removed from the device, and all coordination takes place on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Group makes up the Safe Paths, a platform in the use of research techniques when collecting and using data at the crossroads of the path or location to follow the spread of COVID-19.
" It is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: This is based on research from the whitepaper "Apps Gone Rogue: Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the Safretrace base of the Enga MPC, a magic that forms technologies that originally established in MIT Mediab".
SafeTrace uses high - safety technical hardware to allow users to share sensitive data and locations with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
In 5 April 2020, the international TCN Coaltion was formed by groups that merged for almost identical methods and layers of protocols to a large extent, with the aim of reducing the separation, and following the worldwide intersurgical operation of umps and dialertos, a major asso in the development of large adoption.
In 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace probe used by its government's official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Applye, the confessions that controlled Android's mobile platforms and iOS, announced an incentive for monitoring the kontak, which they claimed would maintain privacy, based on the installation of Blooth Energy and crytography technology in maintaining conflation.
They also published data on major technologies used in the system.
According to Applyee and Google, the system is intended to be rolled into three stages:
Rerolling tools to calculate governments to create an official maintenance of coronavirus saris
does not endorse this motion directly into the iO and AndroidGoole and Aplice as a plan to meet access and persistent problems with the first distribution of the system by means of updates of the operating system, and eventually remove them in the same way as soon as the threat passes.
Reposition of the drug (also known as drug use in other ways, re-profling, re-taking orrapeutic switching) is the use of an up - to - date drug for treating other diseases or medical conditions than the original cause of its development.
It is a line of scientific research currently under way to produce safe and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Other research differences include the development of a vaccine of COVID-19 and the translation of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has an estimated 66 medicinal proteins, each of which has many parts that unite the league.
An effective antiviral treatment against COVID-19 proteins provides a reasonable project in forming a good antiviral treatment.
Of the most important SARS-CoV-2 the target proteins are the tuinlike protease, RNA dependency RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribosphatase.

New York governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the trials in New York State of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA allowed the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorquine phosphate under Emergency Use Auorization (EUA).
The treatment has not yet been approved by the course of clinical tests of FDA and has been permitted only under the EUA as an experimental treatment for the omgencenative use of hospital patients but cannot receive treatment for a clinical trial.
" The CDC said that "the use, intervention, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2" has not yet been established."
" Doctors said they used the drug when" there was no other choice"."
A small study of the use of chloroquine in combining zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D is conducted by a Turkish research team in Istanbul.
Large studies are being conducted at Duke University and University of Oxford.

Remdesivir wasceated and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infesctions . Gilead Sciences subsequently discovered hat Remdesivir unad antiviral activity in vitro resee filo-, pneumo--, paramyxo -- and corona-vis.
An issue in antiviral treatment is the development of resistance by changes that can lead to greater disease and transmission.
Some early pretrial studies suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier to restency. There are some clinical tests performed, including two performed by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with moderate diseases and another for those with greater health problems.
There are three current clinical tests of intravenous vitamin C for people who are hospitalized and seriously ill with COVID-19; two placebo (Cina, Canada) and one who has no control (Sality).

The tests of Italy and China are similar. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine b'A COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Even without a vaccine completes clinical tests, many are attempts to move in the development of the vaccine.
In the latter part of February 2020, the World Health Organization (World Health Organization, WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, the sewn microbiyo, to be available for less than 18 months.
Five vaccination candidates were in the Antas I safety study in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak in 2020, leading to major investment and research activity in order to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use na-provish genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, what is needed for the CEPI to develop the vaccine is speed, labor capacity, wide shipping, and worldwide access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were under research and development at the first part of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The prime targets for platform that have advanced in Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and candidate vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273) Moderna, mRNA-1273)
vral voctor (Phase I developer and vaccine candate: Cano Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vectors)
As CEPI scientists reported in April, 115 total candidates of the vaccine were in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as active projects (79, according to Milken Institution), and 37 others were revealed, but some public information was available (as it was believed to be in planning or design).
An Antas I'II test conducting a preliminary test of safety and immunogenicity, is usually reasonable, is controlled by placebo, and in many places, referring to more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a control group, and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent disease, while monitoring side effects on the best dose.
" Of 79 vaccine candidates actively formed (signed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human education (in" depressed "" further research). "

In March 2020, the U.S. government, industry, and three universities dug up sources to penetrate supercomputers from IBM, along with the sources of clorud coasting from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologists, also called uncertain effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond the disease they fight against.
An additional innocent test in Australia is seeking to enroll 4,170 health - care workers.
It is possible that vaccines are not safe or effective.
Early research to test the effectiveness of the vaccine using animal models particularly in COVID 19, such as ACE2-transgenic rat, other space animals, and nonhuman primates, indicates the need for biosafty-level 3 control measures for handling life viruses, and international coordination to determine standard safety procedures.
Nonhuman animal models tested vaccines against SARS and MERS.
Up to 2020, there is no medication or protection vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identity and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS is a priority for governments and public - health practitioners around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide useful templates for the development of vaccines andrapeutics against the impsection in MERS-CoV.
Until March 2020, there was a MERS vaccine completed phase I in clinical trials on humans, and three others being administered, all viral-vorctored vaccines, two adenovered (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and a MV-MERS).
Social media billboards have promoted a conspiracy theory stating that the virus behind COVID-19 is already well - known and available for vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media billboards have consulted existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus straines such as SARS coronavirus.
The disease Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by acute acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and short breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, swelling of the throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms often takes five days but can last from two to fourteen days.
As most cases produce mild symptoms, some develop into the pneumonia virus and a host of organs.
Up to17th of April 2020, over 2.24 million cases were reported across 210 countries and territories, with more than 153,000 deaths.
Over 568,000 people are cured. The virus is spread mainly between people who have close contact, often by small droplets caused by coughing, sneezing, or speech.
As these tiny droplets develop when breathing, they usually fall to the ground or to the surfaces instead of being contagious at great distances.
People can also be infected by touching contaminated paved surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The germ can survive on paved surfaces for up to 72 hours.
This is thoroughly contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although the spread is possible before symptoms and later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is by means of a real - time reverse transmission polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasiveal swab.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect that they have contracted germs and their guardians.
The recommendations for using the mask in general are varied, where some authorities recommend against using it, some recommend using it, and others order its use.
At present, there is no vaccine or particular antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
The local transmission of the disease has already been recorded in almost every country in all six regions of WHO.
It is contaminated with germs that can be asymtomatic or that produces low - intensity symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and short breath.
Symptoms of emergence include difficulty in breathing, recurring chest pain, confusion, difficulty in getting up, and facial or lip loss; urgent medical attention is recommended if symptoms are present.
Unusually, symptoms above may be seen as breathing like sneezing, helping with colds or swelling of the throat.
Symptoms of gastrointestine such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are observed in different percent.
Few cases in China were originally presented only with chest congestion and tremors.
For some, the disease may grow in pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death.
It is called an incubator time.
The duration of the incubator for COVID-19 is usually five to six days but may cover from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people with symptoms will continue for 11.5 days of infection. Reports show that not all infected people develop symptoms.
Its transmission asymtomatic transmission carriers had not yet been fully known; however, the initial evidence suggests that they could be responsible for the spread of the disease.
The proporation of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and understated, reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) that 20% of all confirmed cases remained symptomless during their stay in the hospital.
China's National Health Commission began to include cases that were unremarkable in its daily cases in 1 April; of the 166 day's infections, 130 (78%) had no signs during the study.
Both spits and saliva can carry many viruses.
Powerful speech emits far fewer droplets than normal speech.
A Singapore study found that uncovering can produce tiny droplets that travel up to 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Even though the virus is not carried by air in general, the National Academy of Science suggests that bioaerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors standing in the hallway outside people's rooms get samples positive for the viral RNA.
A number of medical schemes such as intubation and cardiac resuscitation (CPR) can lead to respiratory secretions that will become violent and will thus intensify the spread of the air.
While there are worries that it may spread through pollutants, this danger is believed to be low. The germ is above all infectious when people are symptomatic; while the spread may be possible before symptoms emerge, the danger is low.
The European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while the spread of the disease is not fully clear, a person in general is contagious to two to three others. The virus lives for hours or days in touching objects.
In particular, the virus was known to be visible one day on the cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in 99% copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective when used properly; soap products weaken the rich barrier layer of germs, kill them, and release them from the skin and other surfaces.
A different solution, such as benzalkonium chlorride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical dysentery), is more effective. In a study of Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken between two days after the onset of hospitalization.
Of five of the six patients, the first employment showed the highest viral load, and the six patients showed the highest viral load on the second day diagnosed.
The acute restrom of the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new high - risk rester of the coronavirus, first separated from three people with pneumonia connected to cases of acute rest disease in Wan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 microbes date to the coronaviruses which is in nature.
Outside the human body, the germ is killed by household soap, where the bubbles that protect it explode. SARS-CoV-2 are closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Whethers are the organs most affected by the COVID-19 because the microbiyos handle the host cells by the enzyme that is cinoted -- linking the enzyme 2 (ACE2), where type II alveoler cells abound.
The germ uses a special outer glycopotein called "spike" to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Serious heart damage was found in 12% of infected people admitted to the hospital in Wanan, China, and this was more frequent in serious illness.
The number of cardiovascular symptoms is high, caused by systemic insomnia and immune system disorders as the disease progresses, but acute myocardial insomnia may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are high in heart presence and have to do with heart labor.
The high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thrombombobolism (25%) were found in patients with COVID -19 infections and may be associated with poor prognosis. The autopsies of people who died in the COVID-19 showed a diffuse alveolesance (D), and matalino-coining inmatatoriatrates in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism for ACE2-expresses the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have systemic hyperinflammation symptoms.
By nature, the pathogenic GM-CSF-secting T-cells is shown in connection with the recruiting of the infected IL-6-secting monocytes and acute lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
The lymphocytic infections are also reported on in autopsies.
WHO has published some of the probes for the disease.
The standard method of diagnosis is the real-time reverse transition polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The examination was traditionally done on rest samples obtained from a naspharynageal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sample of the plema can also be used.
The results are generally available for hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken at two weeks ' intervals and the results have a small easy price.
Chinese scientists have separated coronavirus strain and have published genetic results so that laboratories around the world can free themselves to develop tests of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viral infection.
It seems that during the April 2020th, antibody tests (where active infections can be found and even a person infected with the past) are in progress, but not much has been used.
The Chinese test experience showed that accuracy was 60 to 70 % only.
The FDA in the United States approved the first posint-of-care study in the21th of March 2020 for use at the end of the previous month. The guidelines for identifying the characteristics of a disease released by Wanan University's Zhongnan Hospital suggested methods for detecting clinical - based infections and ecological risk.
Relateral multilorar ground-glass curiosity with peripheral, asymmetric and postrior distribution distribution are common in early applications.
Subfleural domination, crazy lunging, and intermingling may appear in the development of the disease.
Little data can be used about microscopic lesions and COVID-19 pathophysiology.
The main causes of autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, lung attaching and lowering lung
The four types of severity of the vral pneumonia can be observed:
Calm pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large Arypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphic infection and multiciltrationated giant cell format
Serious pneumonia: diffuse alveoledage (DAD) with diffuse alveorlar extensions.
DAD is responsible for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia treatment: arranging exudates with alveoler cavitys and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leulythlastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding scarce areas, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, performing good respiratory hygiene and touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends locking the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommending that the courtyard be used if there is no tissue to use.
Proper hand hygiene is encouraged after any coughing or sneezing.
The CDC recommended the use of cloth facial covers in public, sharing in passing the transmission of asptomatic indibidals. The aim of social diving strategies is to reduce the attachment of infected people to large groups by placing schools and work areas in ruins, restricting travel and canceling by large public gatherings.
Directs for discretion also included that people would fold up at least 6 feet (1.8m) apart.
" There is no known drug that works to control COVID-19. Because the vaccine is not reliable up to 2021 to the earliest, the main part of the management of COVID-19 is the test of reductions, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after washing or when the hands are seen dirty, before eating and after coughing, coughing or coughing.
It further recommends the use of alcohol - based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no soap and water available, for areas where there are no hand sanitizers, WHO gives two outlines for local production.
Of these formulas, counter-microby activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
" Hydrogen butxide is used to help remove bacterial spices from alcohol; it is "an inactive substance for the hand's antisepsis".
The glycerol is added as a means of maintaining reading or homect.
People are managed with protective care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support of other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of having the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to respond to the issue of rest failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Personal hygiene and healthy life - style and diet have been recommended for improving meditation.
Supporting treatments may help people with mild symptoms at an early stage of infection. WHO and Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people who have been hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and palmologists at the U.S. listed a free source of recommendations for treatment from various agencies, IBCC.
Up to April 2020, there was no definitive treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol (acetminophen) more than ibuprofen for the first row of use.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, especially in health care areas when implementing techniques that can produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For healthcast professionals who care for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing man in Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIIR) in addition to using standard care, care for the kontak and care for the air load.
The recommend gear is: The recommended clothing is: PPE gown, breather, eye protection, and medical gloves.
N95 breathators have been approved for conservation sites but the FDA has allowed such masks to be used under Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect against air particles such as dust but to be effective against particular biological agents is not guaranteed for use without brand names.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using facial masks, or in a final way, homemade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not too serious to require mechanical ventilation or alternatibas, but percent of the cases are.
The type of breathing support for the indibidals associated with COVID-19 the fall of rest is currently actively trained for people in the hospital, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided by a blocking high flowsal cannola or biovel positive air pressure.
Neither of these two who go to the same benefit for people would be critical of disease is known.
Some doctors prefer to maintain passive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of small aerosols compared with the high flow of cannum in the nose, and serious cases are most common in older adults (your more than 60 years, and especially those older than 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds for each capita, whichever limits the capacity of a health system to handle a sudden plunge into the number of COVID-19 cases more serious to require hospitalization.
One Chinese study found that 5% had been inserted into intensive conservation units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of the people in the hospital who had COVID-19 were finally admitted to the ICU.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more sophisticated because acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) is formed in COVID-19 and oxygen delivery becomes difficult.
Ventilators capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygen transmission by reducing the risk of lung damage by ventilator and pneumothorax.
High PEP may not be available in old ventilators.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs were in clinical trials.
Remdesivir looks like the most reliable.
Even though new drugs can be reached up to 2021 for development, some of the drugs studied have already been approved for other use or are on a progressive test.
Antiviral medication can be tried by people who are seriously ill.
WHO recommends that volunteers share in tests of effectiveness and survival of potential treatments, and the FDA provides temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or at immediate risk.
It did not undergo clinical studies to show that it was safe and effective for the disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile apple to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users were asked to submit their name and ID number.
The app is capable of detecting "close contact" using data by detecting and therefore a random risk of infection.
Each user can also lean on the state of three other users.
Seeing the potential danger, not only doesquarantine recommend app to itself but it also directs local health officials. The large data analysis of cell - phone data, facial technology, mobile phone following and artificial intelligence is used to follow infected people and people they meet in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel's government moved security agencies to follow the data of mobile phones by people pretending to have coronavirus.
The step was taken to enforce the pharyngente and to protect those who might have been stuck later infected.
Also, in March 2020, the Deutsche Telekom shared the combined data of the phone location with the federal agency of the German government, Robert Koch Institute, to research and control the spread of the virus.
Rusiya has spread facial recognition technology to catch offenders.
" Italy's regional health commissionr Giulio Gallera said that mobile phone operators had been able to alert her that "40% of the people continue to spin and yet".
The German government has performed 48 hours on a weekend with over 42,000 participants.
So did Estonian president Kersti Kaljulaid who made a worldwide call for ingenious solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Indibiduals suffered anxiety from quarantine, travel bans, side effects of treatment or fear of the infection itself.
" BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying, "The rising social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic collapse are perfect storms to impair people's mental health and well - being."
The disease may have a mild course with little or no symptoms, similar to other common illnesses in the upper part of the breath like the common cold.
Gentle cases usually heal for two weeks, while you have serious or critical diseases that can take between three and six weeks to heal.
Pregnant women may be in higher risk of serious contamination at COVID-19 bases on data from other similar microbes, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is lacking. In some people, COVID19 can join the lungs to cause pneumonia.
To the most severely affected people, COVID-19 may quickly spread to acute respiratory depression syndrome (ARDS) that causes a breathorium, septatic shock.
Among the complications associated with COVID-19 are sepsies, abnormal blood clots and heart, kidney and liver damage.
The abnormal clotting of blood, in particular, was described in 6% of the people admitted to the hospital with COVID-19, as abnormal kidney function was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show increased enzymes in the liver (transaminses).
According to the same report, the middle time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, five of which have been used for hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had a median time of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In one study of previous cases, the middle time from the release of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, covering six to 41 days.
By studying China's National Health Commission (NHC), men have a death rate of 2.8% as women have a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of tests after the death of lung samples showed damage to the diffuse alveolar with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Pineumocytes have observed changes in the cytopathic system.
The image of the lungs has paralleled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
Of the 11.8% of deaths reported by China's National Health Commission, heart damage has been detected by increased levels of troponin or heart attack.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of those hospitalized have already had medical conditions. The presence of medical sources and the socieconomics of a region can also affect death.
Estimates of mortality from mood vary because of regional differences, but also because of difficulties of poverty.
A low count of moderate cases may cause excess estimates of the number dying.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases previously acquired could mean that the current death rate is underestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop chronic symptoms of COVID-19 and are 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or to die than nonsmokers. Concerns are mentioned about long - term subsequent illness.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority recognized a fall of 20% to 30% in lung capacity among some of the people who recovered from the disease and a pulmonary scan suggested organ damage.
It can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known if the previous infection provided effective and long - term disease safety for people who recovered from the disease.
The imVID-19 is seen to be, based on the behavior of other coronavirus, but in cases where recovery from COVID-19 was followed by a positive approach to tests for the coronavirus on a later date recorded.
These cases were believed to worsen a long - term infection more than retagation.
The virus is thought to be natural and animal, by the spread of infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but in December 2019 the spread of infection almost entirely improved man's progress toward man.
The study of the first 41 cases of confirmed COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the earliest date for the onset of symptoms in 1 December 2019.
Official publications from WHO reported that the earliest release of symptoms seems to be 8 of December 2019.
A few steps are commonly used to count the death toll.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time, and are affected by the number of tests, quality of the health - care system, medical choices, time from the previous outbreak, and type of population such as age, sex, and general health.
In the latter part of 2019, WHO designated emergency ICD-10 disease codes U07.1 for those who died from a laboratory infection signed in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for those who died from clinical or epidemioologicalally deceived COVID-19 without a signature of the teRS-CoV-2 laboratory. The present death-sociality of deaths was divided by those who were divided by those who were divided by the time divided between the ages.
Based on the statistics of Johns Hopkins University, the treaty of the worldwide death case was 6.9% (153,822/2,40,191) according to the April 2020th.
The figures change from one region to another, and another measure of the case fatality rates (CFR), which shows the percentage of the diagnosed indibids who died from a disease, and the infection fatity rate (IFR), where the percentage of infected indibids (examinted and undiagnosed) died from a disease.
These statistics were not appointed time and followed a certain population from contamination by resolution.
While not all people form antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information about how many people are infected.
At the heart of the outbreak of the disease in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600, 80 (1.7%) is dead.
In Gagelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals, and spread to the younger population, resulting in a slight death, and not all COVID-19 deaths may have been formally identified as such.
Additionally, the German health system is not flooded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may contain antibodies, such as are expected from blood donors.
It was confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died from COVID-19.
The effect of the pandemic and its death toll differ from that of men and women.
Man's mortality rate is higher in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50 ' s, with rates between men and women staying close to just 90.
In China the death rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for this difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be involved.
Sexual - based immunology differences, low rates of smoking in women and men who develop the same bad conditions as hypertension at a younger age than in women may have become a symbol of a higher mortality rate for men.
In Europe, men were 57% of infected individuals and men 72% of those who died in COVID-19.
Beginning April 2020, the US government was not following data by COVID-19 sexually related infections.
Research shows that infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced in 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO represents for corona, VI for germs, D for disease, and 19 for when outbreaks of disease were first identified: 31 December 2019. 31 December 2019.
The name has been chosen to avoid referency at a certain geographic location (E. China), species of animals or groups of people, according to international recommendations for naming which is intended to prevent the birth of the name. The germ that causes COVID-19 has been named as acute respiberatory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SAR-CoV2).
" WHO uses additionally "the COVID-19 virus" and"" vivirus which causes COVID-19" in public communications."
The disease is the same and the germ is commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak of Wanan, China, germs and disease are commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV chronic respiratory diseases as temporary names for the virus and disease according to 2015's guide against the use of disease locations and viral names.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued in 11 February 2020.
Because of the limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers print health - care material such as nasal swabs and ventilator parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital persistently needs a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver at the required set time, a local began to frame and printed 100 valves a night.
After the initial spread of COVID-19, the theories of conspiracy, misinformation and inaccurate information began to emerge about the origin, background, control, treatment, and other aspects of the disease and spread quickly online.
Humans have emerged with the ability to spread the virus to certain animals.
The study failed to find evidence of a viral folding of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
No drugs or vaccines have been approved for treating the disease.
International research into vaccines and drugs in COVID-19 is being done by government organizations, academia groups and industrial investigators.
In March, the World Health Organization began "SOLIRITY Trial " by measuring the effects of treating four existing antiviral compounds with expected effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but various agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
The old deeds made in SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human selyulas.
There are three vaccination disks investigated.
First, researchers intend to develop an entire vaccine into the virus.
Using the latter germs, whether not active or dead, aims to acquire a human's immune response to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to develop a vaccine that causes the immune system to offend certain subunits of the germ.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on S-spike protein that helps the virus to enter ACE2 enzyme receptors.
Third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new immunization technique).
Neecsperitment vaccines from any of their strategies will be checked for safety and effectiveness. In the late March 2020th, the first clinical test of a vaccine was started with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaccinations contain harmless genetic code copied from the disease - causing virus. Refinement dependent on antibodies is proposed as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but it is controversial.
There are more than 300 active clinical studies currently done by April 2020.
Seven tests examine approved treatments for malaria, including four studies in hypoxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Antivirus drugs given new equipment make up most Chinese research, with nine phase III tests of redesivir in some countries that are expected to report by the end of April.
A review of clinical progress for COVID-19 medications and drugs for candidates was dedicated, as is April 2020. Few antiviral medications were present for treating COVID-19, including redesivir, chlorquine, and hydroxychloroquine, loinvir/rivir and loinvir/nar with interferons.
This was temporary evidence for the effectiveness of the ridesivir, until March 2020.
The clinical improvement has been observed in patients treated with cosensionate-use ridesivir.
Phase III, clinical tests were conducted in US, China and Italy. The chloroquine once used for treatment with malaria was learned in China in February 2020, with earlier results.
Nevertheless, there are calls for reviewing research colleagues.
Korean and Chinese Health Authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wan Institute of Virgology, advises that while recommending a single - gram daily dose, it is noted that the two - time dose is potentially dangerous and deadly.
In 28 March 2020, the FDA issued authorization to the evolutionary use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the expense of doctors who treated people with COVID-19. Also among the 11th edition of Chinese guidance is interferon, rivervirin or refectiver for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggests that high doses of riverarvirin are needed to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for additional invenary studies after showing low concentrations of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that prior preparation of the spike protein of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRS2) is significant for the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with ACECE receptor.
The studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with and without zithromycin have limitations that have restrained the medical community from covering these nonschooled therapies. Oseltamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in the vitro and has no known duty in treating COVID-19.
Cytokinine storm can become a shock during the final stages of the chronic COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have a characteristic of anti-cytokinine storm. Tocilizumab has been adopted by the guidelines for treating China's National Health Commission after completing a small study.
It undergos a period 2 of nondovistive examination of the Italian national lebel after showing positive results to people who are seriously ill.
Combined with a blood - test serum fertilization to teach cytokinine storks, it was deliberately intended to protest such consequences, where it was thought to have caused the death of some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved with FDA base in previous cases of studies for treating the ssteriod refracatory cytokinine release syndrome offered for a different reason, COR T cell therapy, in 2017.
Today, there is no venture, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of refined, processed antibodies developed by human immune systems from COVID-19 to people in need is diagnosed as a method of unprofeding immunization.
This strategy has been tried for SARS with results that are not final.
The release of the virus is the expected mechanism of action in which antibody therapy can intervene in defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytoxicity and/o phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of monoclonal antibodies, are in the composition.
Blood production from the infected person, which consists of fluid blood from patients who have recovered and that contain antibodies particularly to the virus, can be increased for increased distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wanan's Central Hospital, who later became infected and died in COVID-19 after becoming infected with the spread of the virus.
