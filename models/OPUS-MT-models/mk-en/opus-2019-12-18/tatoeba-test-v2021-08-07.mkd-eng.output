I really like the look of your hair.
I really like this wine.
I love your website.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I love learning French.
It would be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize that guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I scared the shit out of one.
Iron is tougher than gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'd bring him.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is anybody in there?
Anybody surprised?
Is anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes calorious?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston among me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everyone happy?
Is everyone having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I need to take her home.
I have to pack.
I should go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten that much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's house.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Is it cold outside?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I slapped him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a stone.
I slept in the boat.
I slept on the bus.
I cut my sandwich off.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I smiled at myself.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this amazing?
I kind of like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that pretty?
Is that your mother?
I stared at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I stepped on something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean yes or no?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that satisfying?
Is that Tom's jacket?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So that's where Tom is?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you won't help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Are you paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who can speak English?
Is there any food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this correct in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this radio yours?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this seat free?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Can Tom swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Is Tom bothering you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Did Tom talk to you?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I'm learning art history.
Suddenly, I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you study harder.
I suggest we focus on finding a way out of this cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm starving you to bend over.
I suggest you send someone outside to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I suspected it.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
I swam in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if I was burning and you were the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is your freezer still working?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking a chance to thank her.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to pick up.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't have been a coincidence.
So, no.
It can't be!
It concerns you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, ever, could that happen here.
There's no way it could have been Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It'd be good.
I didn't mind.
That's not what we mentioned.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what disappointed him.
It'd look good.
I don't mind.
It won't improve.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn't matter that you don't want to do it; you have to do it anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like much.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I'm teaching him English.
I'm just fine.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It must have come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's happening.
It happens.
It's cooled off.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I mean it all day long.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one.
I think I have a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made my point.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should check on Tom.
I think I should've asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom some money.
I think I've figured out what time we have to leave.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom has left.
I don't think Tom is breathing anymore.
I think Tom is callous.
I think Tom is conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom is crazy.
I think Tom is dying.
I think Tom is funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom is hurt.
I think Tom is mean.
I think Tom is nice.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is petty.
I think Tom is a zepidlak.
I think Tom is rich.
I think Tom is right.
I think Tom is tough.
I think Tom is vain.
I think Tom is resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was only bluffing.
I don't think Tom is going.
I think we can catch him.
I think we'd better not drink this water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you'll have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're overstating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this on your own.
I think you should help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you need to handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I've been thinking about you.
I thought she had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was seeing things.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom did well.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought Tom might know where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom would be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Well, didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have a lot of work to do.
I thought you didn't want the prize.
I thought you'd found someone else.
I thought you lost your watch.
Don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only dated girls that were lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
I thought you said you could swim.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were going to live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
It hurts like hell in here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
It's a multi-phase process.
That depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical way I can get the job done in one day.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It's not a bit cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
May I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It just seems wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked terrible.
It looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
Seems familiar.
Looks like an egg.
I guess I had too much to drink last night.
Looks like these two are back in a relationship.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snow Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's what got me close to Tom.
He made me clean.
It makes me nervous.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
It might rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
It may be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might rain today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I can't.
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I lost my mind.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants got ripped off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
It probably won't be worth waiting for.
It was raining two days ago.
He was doing a lot of hard work.
I tried to explain it to him, but he's not limping.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
I sincerely regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I try not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
It's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It is recommended that you check to see if there may be any adverse effects if you drink alcohol while taking the medication you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
It's all over now.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's almost gone.
It's so much fun.
It's already seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock already.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
We're fast on foot.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a wonderful idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They took him apart.
You've only caused me trouble.
It's been raining for a week now, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
It's just so hot this week.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
It's better to be alone.
It's better to be optimistic and to deceive yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Souna's here.
It's a newbie.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's closing time.
It's cold in here.
It's common knowledge that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to judge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then run away.
It's easy to see why people like Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
I guess I was wrong about him.
It looks like her style.
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's the way you need it.
It's evil to swear.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's fair.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's got a cloud on him.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be awesome.
It'll get even colder.
It'll happen soon.
Good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's good.
It's gotten better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot out here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
He's in great shape.
He's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just made-up.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
I decide, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to bring such gifts.
It's good to feel that someone needs you.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
It's noisy in here.
It's none of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't have much priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly how it happened.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not just a pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a thousand-dollar hat.
It's not worth much.
It snowed last night.
It's obviously a print mistake.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
It sounds like Tom.
Sounds pretty cool.
Sounds pretty good.
It's our job to help them.
It's completely white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
It's probably still available.
It's flat.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's quite simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
It's so cool!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
It's not right yet.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's funny how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
The surface was flat as a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared.
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
It's so cool.
It's bullshit.
It's totally wrong.
It doesn't hold up this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom urgently.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm in here.
No matter what, I guess.
It's windy.
It's work.
Your loss.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
It lasted all night.
It lasted a lot more than I thought it would last.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Turns out you're an unexpected finer.
I turned on the fan and pointed it toward the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor to be asked to give a speech.
It was so beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It's been a good day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a terrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was a pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny, and beautiful girl like you.
It was a remarkable experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
Such behavior was childish of him.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was getting dark.
He was getting all dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was nice of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It was not easy for me to admit that I had made a mistake.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been shown that fleas living on dogs jump higher than those living on cats.
It was so great.
That was pretty funny.
It was so cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was remarkable.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to climb.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
She was still there.
Tom gave me the picture hanging on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was unfortunate.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unrecognizable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
It was very stuffy in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was worse.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
It won't help a lie.
It's not gonna help you.
It's working well.
It would be very normal to be angry with Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk tomorrow if I catch you up.
I need you right away.
I used to babysit you.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I've already written everything that was meant to be written.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
I've always had someone help me.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked everyone.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked a cake for her.
I baked a cake for them.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I was a little overwhelmed with other things.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.
They betrayed me.
I've been notified.
I've been robbed three times this month.
I've been calling for hours.
I was careless.
I was thoughtless.
I can't wait to meet him.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I was happy here.
I was helping her.
I was helping them.
I was hired to find them.
I've been kidnapped.
I've lived here for many years.
I've been looking for him.
I've been quite busy.
I've been looking for you.
I've been studying French since I was thirteen.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I've been watching.
I've come for them.
I've come to bring him a gift.
I cut my finger.
I've decided to contribute Spanish sentences exclusively this month.
I've decided to forgive him.
I've decided to forgive them.
I decided to take the train.
I've decided to go.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
I've decided to stay where I am.
I've fallen in love with you.

You know me better than you think.
You know me too well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
You're a quick learner.
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.

You don't owe me anything.
You pay me very well.
You've chosen well.
You probably think I'm a pervert.

You ran as fast as you could.
Your car's on fire.
Your car's on fire.
Your complaints upset me.
Your transgressions have dishonored the graves of your ancestors.

You're not that young anymore.
You're not a freak.
You're not a woman.
You're not dressed.
You won't find me.

You won't find us.
You're beneath her level.
You're on his level.
You're not ready yet, are you?

You're wrong, Tom.
Your eyebrows look weird.
Your future begins today.
Your hair smells like spring.

You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
You seem to know the answer already.

You only think she's weird because she's not white.
Traitor!
You two are really cute together.
You used to be so funny.
You used to love Boston.
You're backwards.
They got you drunk.

You've got me all wrong.
I promise.
You do now, don't you?
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
You have to let me go home.
You have to work together.
You made Tom unhappy.
You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been putting this off for too long.
You've seen what I can do.
You were amazing.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
You were lucky to survive the attack.
You were wrong.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom was right.
He drove fast.
You did great.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
You were very brave.
