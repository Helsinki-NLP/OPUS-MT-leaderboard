It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How are they treating you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take some time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look cold.
I want to walk.
Tom waited at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom isn't giving me enough help.
I won't use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary that he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
What's it worth?
The water was up to our necks.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom isn't my father.
Tom is my neighbor.
Tom has already left.
He's probably still got it.
You looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was jammed.
Breakfast is from seven to nine o'clock.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've been watching.
You've chosen well.
Nudists consider nudity normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves stalked the herd.
That song haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Has Tom paid the rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
You got yourself a ticket for nothing.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they been doing?
Tom is homeless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for the damage.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about tomorrow we meet?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery occur?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ringing.
Tom did what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
Competition for that job is great.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he wasn't a good father so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
Alcohol affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom crouched his cheeks a bit.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have said no.
I have to help him.
He's critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit out his gum.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be impertinent with me.
I think you did it.
Don't be ridiculous! We're not descended from monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually eat lunch?
I consulted him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend. He thinks he's too cool for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom is right.
You're kind of rude.
It sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop making Tom feel bad.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom ate breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two related?
He likes egged ham.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle it?
Tom is obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Have you done your best?
Mary rewinded the movie.
She's got nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do you buy these?
He doesn't look so good.
Hey, can I have that back?
It was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to take a look at him.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
Took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Should we really eat pizza this early in the morning?
Can you go the other way?
Tom and Mary spoke French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary used to be married.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose is running out every time I get cold.
We've met a few times.
No one liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you the way you're going to understand it.
Everyone's looking for luck.
Anybody else in the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me terriblely in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still had the price on it.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
There's got to be a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if you asked him to.
Tom is obedient, even submissive.
Where did Tom open?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're cannibals.
You don't make a man with a mold.
She tried to do it herself.
Run!
Are you paying for the delivery?
I want a turnip.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a bad heart.
Did you buy me those?
You've never seen one like that, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitos carry malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's unfortunate.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're taking checks.
This paper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one shot.
The Macedonian has four verb ways: sold, conditioned, commanded, and resuscitated.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The calm surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom isn't very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw garbage on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom is really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom is a martyr now.
Tom looked furious.
What will the Japanese economy be like next year?
That's exactly how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They're giving me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom isn't mad at you.
I'll be back at 6:30.
Tom took me the fuck out.
I've only been gone an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
You made a scandal out of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to do it?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite bat.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
We're out of gas.
Tom is a tramp.
Who do you have on your list?
He's got a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, bro.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought Mary flowers?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're up against.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
May I come with you?
Tom looks pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was food.
Be careful not to step in the mud pond.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom is too sensitive.
Mary didn't do dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are meals included?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Souna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the fateful day on which they will try to escape.
Everyone went crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom has known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the North Gate.
My answer is still yes.
I'm here looking for her.
It's totally wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom has already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Tom might be playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you won't help him?
Tom's room is pink.
There were no survivors.
She was supposed to be quiet.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I slapped him.
Tom isn't alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king found it extremely difficult to give speeches because of a severe speech flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is defective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then run away.
He licked himself.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a famous paragraph of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is careless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem busy.
We'll get right on it.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Let's go for a walk.
Don't overeat yourself.
Just ask them to give it back.
Pull out the clamp.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
I thought you didn't want the prize.
Look at the dimon.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're inexhaustible.
Why can't you go now?
You will learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at this shining star.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Make him confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
We broke up.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me out a little?
I like this school.
Call if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
I got that from Tom.
There's not even a hint of height in his story.
The battle was short.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
A power heater warms up ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the crosstops.
Let's forget it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quickly receiving data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get one?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know about that.
At first, I couldn't stand him.
His sleeve got stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
Everyone left except him.
Tom is here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are blocked.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They crouched beside him.
Tom isn't a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked him to do.
Tom told everyone by mistake that I had died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom is just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water got to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
I'm afraid you'll have to release Tom.
Shame on you!
Don't get so excited.
Silvia loved the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How is that your fault?
Tom drank from the bottle of wine.
I fell off my bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this play start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks broke.
Tom talked Mary into donating money.
I have it with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
You really fooled her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom is my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling so good today!
Tom didn't approve the plan.
After I'm dead, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a multi-phase process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk about Boston too much.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom isn't shy at all.
Tom ran down the hill.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
This mustard is really hot.
We advertise our products on television.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom sat next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened almost thirty years ago.
Tom is too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Can Tom swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom is my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anybody in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30.
She's almost gone.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They've blocked it.
Tom is struggling.
Tom broke the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This has been fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom seriously needs help.
You have to stay away from him.
Tom would've figured it out.
We laughed at Tom.
Didn't you know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfying?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He said that the previous dentist told him that he would remove nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
Tom was the one who suggested it.
It just seems wrong.
Tom is a smart guy.
The powdered career is a mixture of many spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night for me.
Tom drove through town with a lift brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't mean to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be rolling in his grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unjustly, not realizing that their own conduct is undesirable too.
Wear high heels to make it taller.
Do you like bowling?
Sorry, I think you dropped something.
You should just talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
It doesn't make a sound.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What difference does it make?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought that book for him.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to climb.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used inappropriate expressions.
The cafe is powering you up!
Tom was a nice man.
He's a big machine for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I'm afraid of the dark.
We'll miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom writes well.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan no longer felt safe in his own home.
Tom has already told me.
They must abandon the idea.
Tom is really upset.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all see her behavior as repugnant.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose paper is this?
Stay away from her.
His eyes flashed with anger.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom might have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can do anything.
That's what you'll have to ask him.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I can see no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I like to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in these woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
I was the one Tom wanted to meet.
You should ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom might be richer than we thought.
I never intended to deceive you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
He apologized.
I can't find the hotel address.
Smoking means suicide.
Procreants, butterflies, and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's make a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom skinned his knee.
Where did the pineholes come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I need to rest.
May I look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd applauded.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but failed.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink carbonated drinks.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize that guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Get her inside.
You cook turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going. Whatever he wants it to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I gave up smoking too bad.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm already feeling considerably better.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped suddenly.
My father used to bring me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I should've kept my mouth shut.
I'm covered.
Tom arrived early.
He dried his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always been so wary of his English knowledge.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any covers?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What good is that?
That's very helpful.
Tom's phone vibrated.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're an unexpected finer.
Prejudice saves you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't eat lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is packed.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open my head.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate one another?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have much priority.
Take this.
How much is it now?
You got it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won't make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your fancy eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
That's the first cockroach I see this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works at the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems cheerful.
Tom isn't very young.
There's a phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda had a nausea and suspected that she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 in front of the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and I can do it.
I have money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed everything.
Tom threw the arrow.
Don't cock.
It's not safe for me here.
Unfortunately for me, Mary came to the party in a wicked dress.
I'll say what you want me to say.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the satchel to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't forget him.
Tom won the fight.
Get them over here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes flashed when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
It may be a long time before you see me again.
He sat by the river.
My cat's hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got big problems.
This isn't blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they're eaten by humans.
Can you get this arrow out of my leg?
I forgot how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends money like water.
We're not telling anything.
I guess I just didn't think.
I'm not exactly convinced.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
This book is heavy.
Why do we need to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom is always lying to me.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very bad at stifling sounds.
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk around the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, you obviously have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the keyhole.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you picking on me?
Please talk to me.
Angels guard us and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't do anything.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was available.

I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is a ride.
Who saw me?
Tom is getting closer.
Tom is the real hero.
Where'd you come from?
Tom wished he could tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
That did it.

Tom went fishing.
Tom never thought for a second about trying to convince Mary to do that.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I'm sorry I didn't call you.
May I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom is fast asleep.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He stood stunned in front of her.
There's more exits.
Tom has always been very protective of his children.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven't found the time to write that report.
I can do without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's got a cloud on him.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love walking by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Can you dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use my imagination.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Turn in the papers.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was covered with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
Today at noon, we'll be eating cherry from Italy.
Tom is also from Boston.
Be careful, it's a fierce bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I've been gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need sunblock.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was antisocial.
Tonight's fine with me.
They were traveling east.
Tom is quite strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The tiles that fell off the roof fell apart.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Come by anytime.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom wasn't embarrassed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You'd better go.
Tom missed the exit.
I've got two cameras.
What are you up to?
Dan admitted to Linda that he was a heavy drinker.
That's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put his drink down.
My wallet was stolen on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to have a hard time understanding what I'm trying to say.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
I was paid to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary yelling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The amoebas are life-forms.
If you do that to me, I'll slit your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't necessarily mean that Tom is dead.
The waves are made by the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a possibility they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way French write their word for "boombamara."
The crane can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Are you good at this?
We're pretty good.
The pork has been cut into dice and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love travel.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and dance.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom is here.
The Gangsters made a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You have a guilty conscience, don't you?
I coughed up blood.
I need a minute.
The main city of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know how Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his hand.
Take a tissue, your nose is running.
Tom walked with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
All you have to do is trust me.
I just don't want you to do something that you'll regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely goes out.
We've set up a tent.
I didn't think it was gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
I wish you'd stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom threatened me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did this happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still in his pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can walk.
I was invited to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.

The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that her results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree interfered with the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no more blankets.
Tom has a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
Math is the best he's got.

Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom wants to dance.
Tom told Mary that he'd seen John with Ellis.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.

I can get it from her.
Get some food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought you might be able to help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom is downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
Makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and every funeral the deceased.
Tom is probably okay.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They're offering free condoms.
Wet climatic conditions are not related to the semistrate.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom is never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom pulled out a pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long should you be drinking this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy do not write down their happiness.
I still don't know what we're supposed to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I need to finish painting my house.
We didn't create it.

Is Tom interested?
I've got it right here.
I want to have a little conversation with you about Tom.

I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surfed.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work out in the open, if it's light.

I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.

Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed upset.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I got hit by a car.
I'm not a trendy man.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So, these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
This is where I spend most of my day.
Should we wait here for her?
If you go out like that, you'll catch cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom was wounded.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were doing a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Hand me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've been making whites again!
Stop sucking your dick.
Tom finished with the dishes.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
We're being unnecessaryly dramatic.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go myself.
I was the one who dug this hole.

Guess what happened.

No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've already forgiven you.
Why don't we just stay?

Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
What's it from?
Thank you for coming back.
They're cheating on us.

I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd take Tom's side.
He couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I'm sorry I didn't call them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom acted like a gentleman.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Keep Tom entertained.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He watered his garden with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is denied.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gift.
Tom was hardworking.

It can't be him.
Tom can't mean that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her grandmother.
The teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I've got my passport.
It was a masterpiece they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she gets back.
I don't have a pen.
When are we supposed to start worrying?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had surely sank.
Did you buy the medicine?
Has Tom been drinking?
I'm having a hard time.
The question is who will do it.
I'll leave for Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everyone happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I was completely wrong.
Please ask me anything.
Hey, what's up?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom is under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom is a Wunderkind.
He walks to school.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't ignore nature.
I don't see why you won't help.
Tom seems very arrogant.
Now the question is what should we do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners.
It doesn't make a sound.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom is forgetting.
Sounds pretty good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom was irritated by Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.

These animals are endangered.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom is finished.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has great potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so that we would not miss a word.
I already have plans this weekend.
Why are you so nervous tonight?
Tom fell backward.
We're out of line.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's jokes are hilarious, and they get even better once he's had a few beers.
You have sweet eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yeah, right, it'll be fixed... when the will gives birth to grapes.
Tom is a consultant.
Can I talk to you?
You insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when are there fireworks?
Tom might be lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.

I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.

In each part, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you sick of me?

Money is not the criteria for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Keep your fingers crossed!
The concert ended with the folk anthem.
We went looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Hold on a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
You ran as fast as you could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's enough air in here.

The sun is the star of billions of others.
I caught measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll go this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Have you Googled her?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have much to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's true to me.
Are you sure we shouldn't get an appointment first?
One who can hear butterflies laughing can also know the taste of clouds.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't handle them.
They drew lots to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.

This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?

I totally understand.
Tom seems shaken.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, did you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
It's about to rain.
This will make our work significantly easier.
I think that's terrible.

Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles is it between here and Boston?
I'm pretty good at it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
She was still there.
I've got a bunch of questions.
Who runs things here?
I've heard so much about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Each nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It'll get even colder.
What are you drinking?
How it came - that's how it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.

We're expecting her.

I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Do you want to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom threw a rotten egg at Mary.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.

I can handle her.
Can you play that cadre on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom was immediately worried.
I don't have feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.

Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
Your loss.
We wrapped up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom is seated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I go on?
He was smoking a lot.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It's better to be optimistic and to deceive yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was lukewarm.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy was silent.
The ship's hull is divided into a number of watery parts.
Given what you've been cooking, I'll do the dishes.
Let's leave the subject.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose your nerve.
It's got fake eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one cookie left.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Let's not!"
He's not the shy guy he was anymore.
- Contach?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom has never been mean.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere, there were boys divided into groups, some played marbles, some with a ball, others riding a bicycle or riding wooden horses.
Doubts ruin friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in that bottle.
We should both go.
The pain caused by love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You're wrong about her.
Let me check the manual.
Energy comes from the inside.
No one believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He banged his head.
We're out of here.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Do not expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom is getting angry.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
It's less wet today than it was yesterday.
It's hard to make new friends.
It's funny how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you going to do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell who the baby wants, because it's pointing to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom was caught by a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't like to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim has never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Can you fix a toilet?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're married?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom was with me all morning.
Her skirt has a pin on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom is too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom is breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one went with me.
I know Tom will eventually get out of prison.
The most expensive thing is land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom is a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
This milk is sour.
We're out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why do you resist?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first one to ask a question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That'd probably be a problem.
Calculate how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Are you up at six?
Tom sat down again.
What country is Boston in?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of a computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I was burning my lungs, I was just mumbling in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You've heard exactly.
Tom has a headache.
Let's not.
There's no one here.
That's not advised.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You did your best.
He's a glutton.
First, let's talk about what Tom needs to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom is an errand boy.
Tom isn't listening.
They want right away what you told them you would give them.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many respects, women and men are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's up?
Is that necessary?
Tom fell behind.
I'll never like you.
He made it look easy.
You'd better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well has dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you'd better call them.
Some people like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What's there to do with this?
Does your dog bark at them?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I love German doughnuts.
We were 18 years old at the time.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset seeing him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran.
Keep going.
This is disgusting.
Tom is really busy.
Tom said he didn't know what Mary wanted him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Hold on.
You're a little talky, aren't you?
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out your candles and make a wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom gave Mary a cruel look.
Tom was wearing a hoodie.
Tom looks determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended not to know Linda.
I swam in the river.
Are you ready already?
How long has it been?
Don't burn yourself.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom is a joker.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom struggled to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be skinny.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one drink.
No one's writing to me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to talk with his mouth full.
Everyone was in control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was your last job?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little bit.
Who's Dan talking to?
They cursed us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom isn't invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his father at all.
Tom isn't very tough.
It was after midnight.
That's outrageous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?
Tom looked around as if he expected something to happen.
I was persuaded to quit smoking.
You can take your coat off.
I don't think I was followed.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is very pessimistic.
You're entitled to one phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I expected.
Tom swam in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go back home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's go get this guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I wouldn't want to get in trouble.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out this form.
I don't imagine fun like that, but whatever you want.
Do you think Tom would want to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom put butter on his toast.
We've got work to do.
I heard him sniff.
Should we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there on that hill.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the children alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's gonna be Christmas soon.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed used to these kinds of problems.
You'll be all right.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the tablecloth.
He hardly ever went there.
Tom is stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the winners are always right, and the vanquished are the guilty.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translation of jokes is quite difficult, if you can even say it's possible.
It's been a good day.
I bring bad news.
This isn't helping.
Overcome weakness.
How many pushups do you do a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
You wouldn't happen to have a key, would you?
Let's be realistic.
A lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was tearing up on alcohol.
Tom is getting naked.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is difficult.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small size.
I'll make sure we complete this project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
Music is universal.
You squeeze too hard when you shake hands.
And if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
You won first place in the game.
I just want you back.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed up late.
You're disgusting.
Everyone kept quiet.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad.
You gave up the plan.
It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can escape death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times before.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You're gonna need a ticket to take a bus.
We're very pleased.
Do we need them that much?
He was desperate because of his health problems.
Do you know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has an earache.
Dan was hit in the head with a hammer.
Who gave you that idea?
What was Tom doing?
You're in the middle of a nightmare.
It's not a good time now.
You're out of booze.
When are you leaving?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
This song is stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's Tom having in mind?
A mother's advice would outsmart a friend.
We're not out of danger yet.
Tom is freaking out.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan is now wanted by the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him over there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday is the second day, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom urgently.
Tom is waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I've done it.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw worse.
We know each other.
Cooking pasta is easy.
The hunter went deep into the forest and never came back.
You're hurting me.
I'll pay whatever it takes.
I haven't been happy since Tom left.
Breakfast is served.
Tom is a kind man.
Stop screaming! It hurts my head.
You're not gonna command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't get fat.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'll get stronger.
This elephant is adored by young children.
Thank you so much, Tom.
This is difficult for her.
Mary put on her lipstick.
She's got a picture.
He's just swimming.
Flowers wither.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise.
This is so annoying.
We need more American slams on Tatoeba immediately!
We're sorry.
Tom might get scared and give up.
Is this seat free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want some tea.
I don't want to get into it.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It would be nice to keep your mouth shut.
Tom said Mary was a bad influence.
Where's your weapon?
Tom wants to do it.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the tune of the trumpet.
Unsatisfying libido is what produces all the art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom is being foolish.
I think Tom will be here on time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
She's complicated.
Check to see if the gas has been turned off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the pot.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written a few books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitos enjoy human company.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you give Tom a message?
He flirts so hard that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lit the curtain by accident.
Did Tom talk to you?
Self - injury is hard to understand if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This will hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's evening.
Pressure's rising.
Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom has been driving that car for three years.
Can peace be used in dishes?
Tom knows the way.
Tom gave Mary a bad judgment.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you call them?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom is the leader.
Save Tom.
You haven't solved this problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I don't feel comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They don't have a choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom got very angry.
What kind of situations would you use him in?
Can't we start over?
I'm afraid you'll have to do this without any help.
We're all endangered.
Tom won't like him.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom sighed.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't come back three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Do you do any sports?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid he'll get lung cancer.
I'm so cold.
Tom played the piano for three hours without stopping.
I got a quality one.
Did you find anyone to look after the kid?
I'm quiet.
He was after the thief.
It was a remarkable experience.
Tom chuckled aloud.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has many problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
I won't say anything.
It'd be good.
We're fast on foot.
Tom is very stingy.
That's all I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda to safety.
They're my cousins.
It's eleven o'clock already.
I'm a homosexual.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom made for me.
I've seen it myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems frustrated.
What the fuck do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where there are none.
My sister makes her hair two or three times a week.
I slept on the bus.
Rainwater evaporates when it's hot.
Ask him to wait till I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom must still be in school.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
You're on his level.
I like to be early.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
Tom might hire Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please air the room.
Tom is still trying to talk Mary into taking the job.
How many percent of our bodies are water?
I don't speak French as well as you think I do.
That's very clever.
Please help me welcome Tom.
You're so smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't take longer than five minutes.
If the time was running, the radioactivity was diminishing.
Should we believe that?
What are you getting so dressed up for?
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I don't need to convince him.
Tom is sitting behind Mary in French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll give them a call.
It always happens the same way.
And thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brings you here?
I need new speakers for my computer.
You're gay.
What are you up to?
Why are you being mean to me?
I can't read without my glasses.
I don't mind helping.
No one did anything else.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
These books are new.
Thanks for inviting us.
Tom wiped the dishes.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a nice point.
They must be worried.
I gave him a ride.
That gave me an idea.
The watch thing broke.
I asked around about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Let's all follow me.
This is a good spot to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom isn't really old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to watch the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm feeling a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go sleight.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always cheers me up.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a fun guy.
Did you buy anything to eat?
Boston is a wonderful city.
Look at me.
How many gallons of oil does it hold in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
It's possible there's another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This pear is green.
Tom regretted what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom frowned.
I see what you mean.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom is conscious.
Tom combed his hair.
Everyone sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't like walking.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're about to start.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate whatever you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I've always thought you were from Boston.
Should I give a sign?
You'll have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write Tom a thank you letter.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom went back to Boston.
The light faded.
Come on!
What if Tom says no?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan walks his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice over for dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's pretty close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherited - everyone gets his own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
This cloth stretchs a lot when it's washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I've been out of class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this before?
Without bait, it'll be hard to fish.
Tom was taking a nap.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion matters.
Alcohol reduces inhibitions.
Tom needs your help.
I'll have him go right away.
Tom looks confused.
Nobody wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were as black and deep as a abyss.
Tom tried to speak, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom is fat.
I think Tom is hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the children.
Everybody's got drinks.
Tom lifted the box.
He's a strict critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten anything?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I'm here to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim because it was cold.
It's not necessary.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
I'll take it.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom woke up.
Please repeat.
You're so dramatic.
Tom licked himself.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's cool.
Why didn't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
It's so cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to get her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe prints at the scene.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom kept the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom sat next to Mary.
Tom can't be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom is a turnip.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this on my own.
They've been probed by the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Do you know for a fact that this is not diamond making?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls who wear high heels.
Dream you know.
I looked at her.
A great crowd has gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is unstable.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you guys crazy?
I'm warm.
Tom was barefoot.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I'm irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut my sandwich off.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
Boys and girls read.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left uneaten food on the plate.
Tom changed direction.
There's not a person alive in the classroom.
The rocket took off.
We laughed.
Tom was a little startled.
Tom is just visiting.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
Have a good trip.
Go back to your seat.
Tom was considerate.
Tom made sure he looked busy, so Mary wouldn't ask him to help her.
I hardly eat meat.
I'll go ask her.
I'm saving this seat for him.
Tom couldn't help.
I'll call her later.
Flowers are quick to wither after you cut them.
I called them yesterday.
I'm wearing a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late last night.
I just don't like it.
In addition, I can fly.
We're out of money.
There was hate between them.
There's nothing to see here.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
He and I are friends.
I may admire others, but I've never had to be anything other than who I am.
Sometimes it's hard to tell if Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't hold me.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Did you make a wish?
Kids are sometimes afraid of the dark.
Stay out of it.
I had to stay.
Tom is the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom will get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom became sad.
Poor hair.
This is the best restaurant in our area.
That's what I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there's life, there's hope.
I heard them sobbing.
Too bad I didn't ride my bike here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so many.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to get killed.
I'll be damned!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many plants did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What'd you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to shadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
You didn't even give them a chance.
He suddenly appeared.
I'll do as you command.
It's a long story.
Tom will be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He runs secondhand cars.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
Do you know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom is cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's outnumbered.
Who was the thief?
He's got charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom won't catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the record doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get tough.
I didn't know whether to get angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We've been waiting.
Tom got up at seven.
I've always wanted a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come to visit us next month?
The puppets are run by wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you.
Other girls teased her about her clothes.
You'll get confused.
I'm not gonna follow you.
Maybe Tom has already done what he should have done.
I'll give them one more chance.
I just got a call from him.
The failure made him quiet.
How have you been, Tom?
I can't bear to look at him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Even she doesn't understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants harm bees in their health.
You can go now.
They're stalling.
Tom is a sophomore.
If I can understand it, anyone can.
Tourists weren't happy.
Tom took off his socks.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom stutters.
Laws are like cobwebs - hunt flies, but they let wasps and hornets penetrate.
You're prouder than a peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, like he used to.
He took off his fur jacket downstairs, went upstairs, and knocked gently on the door.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't see the same subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was wrong with Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we are full.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait at the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
Did Tom stay long?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He escaped danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to do it again?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom seems desperate.
You sound relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is an extremely beautiful city.
This arm doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my report.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Dear to you."
We were very close.
I sweat every day.
Give me your knife.
Nobody defends my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
We got a big day tomorrow.
Tom is a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Let me catch my breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet?
He's watching TV now.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so happy to be home.
Can we stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can chain me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you will never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you.
Try this sweater.
The cat stuck its claws in my hand.
"When did you fall asleep yesterday?" "At four o'clock." "What? What were you doing so late?" "I was talking on the phone with my ex-boyfriend."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little overwhelmed with other things.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're making me nervous.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you hard of hearing?
I belong here.
You're my friends.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom isn't as naive as many think.
I punched him in the jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm taking a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Is there even that word?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
Everyone turned Tom down.
You can't fire him.
Ken collects old coins.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
There's no damage.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom is sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can get you a cab.
You're in no danger.
What can I choose between?
We have to get them to bed.
The only spice Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's what got me close to Tom.
I don't want to bother them.
Tom was beaten up.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
I brought a couple of bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very pissed off.
Why does Tom do that?
I have an assignment for you.
How does a plural of nouns become?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got a bad cold from him.
It's gotten better.
This world is a valley of tears.
You don't have to be crazy to work here.
I saw Tom.
Don't be mad at us.
Tom put the gun down.
Tom needs a haircut.
Get me some coffee.
You're a real piece of work.
It was a subtle trick.
We'll leave the theory to the mathematicians.
Where'd this come from?
We're not done.
Tom was put in prison for spying.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These little letters are read only with a magnifying glass.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a shredder.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
You were very brave.
I won't hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer reads 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He'd do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say anything you don't mean.
I decorated my room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'll go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Let Tom push his ass.
Our boat was approaching the small island.
You're not gonna win.
Wait a minute. My laundry's done. I'm gonna go give it up.
Tom was a miner.
It's completely white.
I wish I had enough willpower to keep a diet.
The man in question is currently in America.
He's thought to be guilty.
I'll check on Tom.
I'll be at my desk.
I've never been here before.
That trumpet sounds so bad to me.
My eyes are tired.
I need to get away from her.
Tom makes $300,000 a year.
Do I really need this?
Are you expecting them?
It's a quick favor.
We had to help Tom.
That's all they're talking about.
A boy grabbed my purse as he rode by on his bicycle.
When was the last time you fed the baby?
My muscles are a little sore.
We have experience.
Tom doesn't look very good.
I'm ugly.
They're gonna quit me because I'm so late for work.
I thought it might be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
What's Tom going to do now?
That's the spirit!
There's always a catch.
Your health is very important to me.
Spirit, are you there?
There's no smokers here.
Is your freezer still working?
The city restored that old historical structure.
I can't ask him to do that.
They're really ugly.
Tom came back covered in mud.
That's not for you.
Tom wondered if Mary would know what was wrong.
I don't have anything else.
Tom is at the pool with his friends.
Tom wasn't paranoid.
You're very good with children.
I just threw it in the trash.
We just got out of there.
Tom reserved a seat.
I want to use this.
What color were Tom's socks?
Tom baked me a cake.
I've never been a juror before.
I've always admired Tom.
I don't like when they touch me.
Look at the clouds.
He was so angry that his veins were so wet.
Traveling abroad is out of the question.
Tom ended up winning.
Tom arrived right away.
I came to apologize.
It won't be enough.
I'm hiding from Tom.

Tom took off his clothes and went to bed.
The opposite is true.

Tom didn't want to leave so early.
I'll explain later.

Have you been there?
She's wearing pantyhose.
We're not missing any rocks.
Tom left on his bike.
He came back at six.
It has been shown that fleas living on dogs jump higher than those living on cats.
Be careful climbing up the ladder.
Were you with anyone?
I'm not a monster.
What's this made of?
The butler opened the door.
Tom must have been wrong.
Get your paws off me.
Don't say that name around me.
Are you going to throw that away?
Tom has a good job.
They're my stuff.
Tom went for a walk every day.
The same thing has happened to a friend of mine.
I don't feel that way about you anymore.
Tom isn't stupid.
Tom changed the subject.
We'll deal with this.
It feels so good.
What's Tom drinking?
I'm going to reread this.
Give me the glasses.
I'm helping them with something.
I know about him.
We have the key.
Tom failed in a disastrous way.
You just got back from vacation.
Tell your son to stop bothering my daughter.
The text is too long.
When did you come to Boston?
Something bit me.
Mushrooms contain significant quantities of minerals.
Tom left them.
She's avoiding me.
Tom went back to work.
I want you to find them.
Shouldn't we wait for them?
I wouldn't like that.
I hear you're rich.
Most people are more afraid of facing mistakes than of making mistakes.
This must be a stupid question, but who's stronger, the lion or the tiger?
We'll have company.
We're classmates.
Tom pulled the cork out of his champagne.
There's a girl missing.
Tom despises your insolence.
Don't eat raw pork.
Tom made a list of places he wanted to visit.
From his looks, I concluded that he was angry with me.
I miss Boston.
The girl brought me a red and a white rose.
We should ask them.
I think you know Tom.
They don't make you happy.
It's time to get to work.
He fired three times.
I'll complain if I want to.
They're free.
Are you coming back?
We can talk about it.
My daughter sings in a choir.
I won't say another word.
You can make it easier for yourself.
You son of a bitch, you know.

We're the best.
Now go ahead.
Tom can't help you.
Tom isn't going to the market.
Give me a few minutes.

Tom is really stupid.
Tom wants to see it.
Tom was only partly joking.
I'm gonna find out who did this.
Tom hates his job.

Why don't you trust me?
Tom was trying to avoid being captured.
Have you found her yet?
Tom is alone there.
You did a good job.
Don't be a faggot.
Freedom of speech is limited in certain countries.
Tom lifted his hat.
We're looking for them.
I think Tom is right.
Could you recommend a good book?
I'll take you home.
Does he have a stomachache?
Is Tom dead?
You're not biting me.
Try to fight.
I think I love you.
I care about all of you.
They crouched next to her.
You're a pig.
You're not reliable.
Tom can be trusted.
It'll be hard to convince them.
Don't get all carried away now.
Has anyone seen Tom?
I could use some help with this.
I owe Tom a lot.
It was an amazing night.
Jasmine's scents and lavender are my favorite.
I just want you to turn around and look at me.
Tom seemed bored.
She's very individualistic.
The knife had a very sharp tip.
Get ready.
Put it down here.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you if I was burning and you were the last bucket of water.
The universe is expanding.
I thought you lost your watch.
You're in charge now.
Not all of them are asleep.
Did everyone agree?
These are my pencils.
Aren't you going?
Do you know anyone who might be able to help?
It's just so hot this week.
Nobody wanted to get off the table.
Do you think Tom would like this?
Tom came by earlier.
He's foolish.
Maybe you can help them.
The hearts of the broken mirror lay scattered on the floor.
I can't ask him to do that.
He's eating pork chops.
I have to go help them.

Esperanto is an catchy language.
Garlic makes a strong smell.

I have a few minutes off.
I'm sorry, but I don't feel like it right now.
When was the last time you were in an art gallery?
Play that song again.
I like vanilla ice cream a lot.
I just had breakfast.
One step at a time, he comes down the stairs.
That's not supposed to happen.
Let me change the subject.
I'll make popcorn.
Tom put a stethoscope on the patient's chest.
Should we call him?
My sister got more gifts for Christmas than I did.
What's going on with you at work?
What's got tongues and doesn't taste?
Let's play football.
Tom stopped yelling.
Were there any survivors?
I'm still at work.
Tom is warm.
Where's the bathroom?
Tom seems to know everything.
She gave birth to twins.
My boyfriend's a reporter.
What's Tom afraid of?
Tom would've stood up.
What kind of shampoo do you use?
He's good at cards.
We all love you.
What were they doing?
I think you need to handle this on your own.
As far as I can see, there's nothing from Tom's medical point of view.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
Tom seems trustworthy.
Shame on you!
Is Tom still alive?

How do I know how to get back?
I'm going to dinner with an old friend.
Eating can be spicy without being angry.
Bring her home.

I'll see you when I get there.
That could be true.
I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do.
I wish I hadn't married Tom.
I know what this is.
When does Tom arrive?
Could you pass me the remote?
I'll get him to mow your lawn.
You helped her once.
We cried in a duet.
I'll set the table.
I've got a lot to say.
I was in the bedroom.
He shouldn't have any problems.
It's hard to imagine.
Where's the nearest didgeridoa repair shop?
Where did you go with Tom?

I don't work for him.
I can't wait to get home.
Tom killed himself on his 30th birthday.
Let's go and see what happens.

I must have forgotten.
Tom talked Mary into going to the party with him.
Tom can do almost anything.

What else could you have done?
Please sign here.
I'll see if she's in there.
It's gonna be awesome.
I don't think I can move.
I'm glad I can be yours.
He talks a lot.
I'm not really normal.
I thought they found him.
Why don't we order pizza?
The worse, the better.
Is your head full of straw?

Teeth is an infectious disease.
Tom was in Boston a year ago.
I just saw him.
What's gonna happen to us?
My hometown is by the ocean.
I left home at seven.
How's it going, Tom?
The wind changed course.
Please don't ask her.
I have to get them home.
No one will ever forget you.
Why didn't you call before you got here?
I can't get a straight answer from Tom.
I wish I'd known this before.
Is anything missing?
I didn't do it for him.
She felt quite alone.
I'm going hunting on my own time.
Where'd my driver go?
He finds himself a flaw.
The coat is coated with fur.
Tom is ugly.
When did you and Tom buy that?
I've been notified.
He slept soundly.
I never doubted that.
They're made into pinecones.
Tom doesn't see it that way.
Tom sat on the stairs talking to a girl named Mary.
I know what you ate.
I always feel like eating.
Tom gave Mary John's message.
Your wishes are my command.
I have an apartment in Boston.
Can I ask a question?
I want you to go to Boston with Tom.
Someone just called.
Can I show you something?
I'm not much of a sailor.
My father's been burned on the white trunks last month.
What a sad story!
Try to get a good night's sleep.
I don't think I'll live much longer.
You need to help her.
They're worried about him.
Tom wasn't aware that Mary was hoping to kiss her.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I don't have any friends.
Tom plays in a band and is very handsome.
Why can't you take it?
Put the gun down.
Tom's interest faded.
Let's play volleyball.
Yesterday was fun.
Tom might help us if we ask him nicely.
Tom enjoys eating in restaurants.
Tom says he's used to hospital food.
This is my problem.
I don't think he's gay, he's married and he has three kids.

I wouldn't think so.
I ate chicken medallions.
My dream came true.

Did Tom confess?
Tom is diabetic.
Call it whatever you want.
I'll have Tom take care of it.
How would you fix it?
This sounds familiar.
Would you like to watch TV?
Of course!
They're not happy.
They verbally abused them.
Why were you chasing me?
I've been quite busy.
I couldn't do what you did.
Are you always busy?

You're beneath her level.

Tom seems effective.
I need to be alone.
I can get it from them.
I read Tom a story.
Why are you tired?
Tom said he'd leave at 2:30.
I'll marry him.
It's not about luck.
I think you know the rules.
I sincerely regret it.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He's back at six.
Let these people go.
Tom didn't give a shit.
You're a good son.
I'll get you to talk to Tom.
I almost called them.
The dragon has caught sight of her.
I have to turn the phone off.
The weather is good.
This was false information.
Nobody wants to be around him.
Dan was seen talking to a stranger near the restaurant.
Tom did it easily.
I know you're tired.
Why didn't you graduate?
There's a cherry outside my house.
He's the owner of the firm.
Peace at home, peace in the world.
They hate each other.
I'm so busy getting ready for the party.
It won't improve.
He's already done his job.
My ears are numb.
We're not worried.
Don't stay too long.
Tom lives in a boat.
Let's be creative.
You look pretty bad.
I don't want to exert myself in vain.
We went to the same church.
I arrived in Boston at 2:30.
How could Tom know?
She's studying at a deaf school.
You have a habit that I don't like.
You sound so sure.
How desperate are you?
I don't know why I took so long.
I don't want to wait.
What the hell is that?
Radio's off.
I turned Tom down.
You should be proud.
I'm in love and confused.
I keep most of my money in the bank near my office.
Do you remember what happened last year?
You're going with me, and that's it!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let's do our best.
I'll pay.
It's quite possible that Tom won't help us at all.
I'd rather sit down.
Read this.
I arrived here a few minutes before you.
I'm helping him.
That's blackmail.
I'm starting to worry.
Tom and Mary work in the same office.
To envy is a sin.
All children are strangers.
I've been shot.
Tom isn't prone to drama.
I finished twenty-five projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't walk if he didn't look through the keyhole.
This tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That's not exactly vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They talked quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom has a small dick.
Tom believed everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not even going to the point.
Well, what's the point?
Could you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were after them.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
They were after you.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul left in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I'm not digging you wells.
I've only got a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom must love you very much.
You're a nice cook.
There's no shortcut to the top, just to the break-in.
Tom is quite weak.
The surface was flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom gets paid a lot.
It was unfortunate.
I can tell you cared about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked everyone.
Automobiles are now widespread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He's gone to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom is wearing chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a newbie.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my snack?
The regular was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you should help me.
Is his aunt eating an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I showed you?
I'm making scrambled eggs.
I like blue.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take a bribe.
Don't sugarcoat my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been calling for hours.
She passed away a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipes?
She got picked up pretty good.
What does all that mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was a pleasure to spend the evening with a smart, funny, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom is a spoiler.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was held in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
He said he was texting me at night, but he was lying to me, obviously.
Guess.
He dressed himself for a bath.
A river of sweat began to pour down my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just drop it.
I want to study math.
The keys are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How did you make out?
Movies are a great distraction.
At first, I didn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
You made me like jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you're planning to leave.
How many guests do we expect tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I was wrong about him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
Our flight was cancelled due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might come back.
I'm so scared.
The whole board's against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom was all made a tree.
Oh, that's great.
Avoid bad associations.
Airport's in the area.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom isn't scared.
I cut my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The cork won't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to have hot coffee, and Tom likes to drink milk.
I gave her a fake address.
I lost my mind.
I don't feel like it any more.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
It's important to me what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom chuckled.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
Why do I need a lawyer?
The nuns are singing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'll really try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where's Tom buying?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be that stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything is quiet again.
That's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Take off your clothes.
I'm having a lot of problems right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I have a cold.
The question is whether he can do it or not.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only dated girls that were lower than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost bumped into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom disobeyed his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's building a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
Tortana looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where was Tom going?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
Germans have a looser attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom won't come back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they placed his body in a large grave.
Women like men with mustaches.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, who will?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud thunder.
They both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I had no luck at all.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I made Tom very angry.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always preferred mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most distinguished American songwriters.
It can't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't make Tom angry.
Tom might never come back here again.
Nobody likes crybabys.
He cried for a toy.
He tried to climb the distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do it if I could.
Tom is pretty nuts.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We got here first.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burnt my eyes.
Good to see you all again.
Tom liked Mary very much.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'm happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're a quick learner.
We ate very nice food.
Tom has been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
No one will bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought scented garbage bags.
I suffer from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely goes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom's passport has expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How come you made such a mistake?
It's a good memory.
Can he do whatever he wants?
The time has come to say good-bye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really hot.
We bring them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to know the answer already.
Could you give us a ride?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns this ship?
Yeah, so?
I asked where Tom was.
You've been very helpful to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and save you.
I got a rock in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We got drunk.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope in a second.
Her long hair was brawny brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his problem?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I have a few donuts.
I'm studying French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls aren't playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was thoughtless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We have to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went to walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His client is made up mostly of poor people.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why does that bother you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women like men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname suits him perfectly.
Can you make it stop?
Call if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
He took his sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom reluctantly left.
Tom seems a little down this morning.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom was kicked by a mule.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should've bought another bottle of wine.
Pass the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I'm taking a chance to thank her.
Tom isn't very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a bum!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom is insecure.
Tom wouldn't give in.
Tom was suspended.
They made out.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom looks upset.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope he's okay.
You're capable, but you're slacking.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
We might have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this on your own.
Anybody surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him any way I can.
Tom became angry.
It's work.
We'll figure it out.
Praise moves students to work harder.
Tom isn't very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about thirty.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll work it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom weighed himself.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom picked up his nose.
Tom looks a little shaken.
He's drunk.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady " was used only for nobles.
Tom has been studying French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How does a man choose just one?
I'm here to feed Tom's fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on the bloody bed, with a dagger torn deep into his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
I'm paid to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be so proud.
You used to be so funny.
Can you stay here for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I can hear your childish laughter.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are getting something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom is quite thin.
Tom usually wins arguments.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder noise?
Leave work and pleasure out of it.
I'm working in Boston now.
You put a crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're all right.
Your zipper's open.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom is sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't make Tom angry.
I turned on the fan and pointed it toward the wall.
This is a homemade jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's corpse in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not entirely true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you some water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm sick of Boston.
Tom had a bad headache.
As soon as he reached him, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom drove in the back seat.
The bank loaned the company $1 million.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
I guess I had too much to drink last night.
Tom was having a good time.
Tom said he couldn't remember the guy's name.
I'm gonna grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have an interesting book to lend me?
Tom moved cautiously.
Just get inside.
He forged a sword out of steel.
I moved to a new house last week, and I studied the library yesterday.
I've told myself.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom is an only child.
A woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
They were many more than we were.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't trust you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan became angry.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll have him stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all this stuff.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me outside the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't fire my arm.
I'd better call him again.
Tom isn't very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked inside.
A blood vessel broke in my eye.
Tam visited Mary yesterday.
You overdid it!
He's got a son who's missing.
I'm trying to work.
What kind of taste do you want?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch that the show is about to drop; they haven't sold many cards.
Tom is coming.
Tom doesn't think he should use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl's asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't force your child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
I like reading books.
They executed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted many children.
Tom seems silly.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their faults.
Tom sat behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What do you see here?
I get the impression it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I appreciate it.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary is a real expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the lights on.
There's too much acid in this orange.
Tom came to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom is away on business.
Tom said he was going to water the garden.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually joins thunder.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom knocked him down.
This lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the glass cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to make out with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom is British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you're not sleeping yet?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the courage to try it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen it.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I made my point.
I'm filling in for her.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this amazing?
Tom said Mary was down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm dating my ex-boyfriend again.
Just do this job.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knew how to play tennis, but he didn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign on the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way it keeps its head remind me of Maria.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them right now.
I got my shoes wet.
Tom would fight back.
She always works hard.
What country are you a citizen of?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'll meet Tom.
I prefer dogs to cats.
There's still some space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary has dyed her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom can't swim yet.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared so much about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
It doesn't hold up this heat.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you right away.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't have any money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not the way I wanted it.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Go on with your work.
When do you close?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a recluse, you could say.
I can't handle this assignment.
Looks like we're gonna have to do a lot more than that.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them right now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We do almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yelling at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never stays long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everyone talked.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom looked through the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'm gonna get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
The forest was quiet then.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was depressed.
We're playing with fate.
I thought she had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom can't feel it.
There's some more tea in the pot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise made me nervous.
This is justifiable.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know things.
Was It All Just a Dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom disguised himself as a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom ran out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She handles a saw well.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
He abandoned the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom isn't that tall.
It's been raining for a week now, up and down.
He is slowly recovering from his illness.
I want a turn-up.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How can I reach Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the ceiling.
Her face was covered with sperm.
Tom is fair.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you've won.
I'm so confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so he was ordered to leave the company.
I'd understand what was from you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
Have a nice week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom should go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why blame them?
They're too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom went upstairs.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what's just started.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
A nail blew the tire.
We made ourselves a tree.
This is much better.
I'll get her to mow your lawn.
Tom is good at math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a little girl.
Your sons are quite handsome.
I know what that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They broke the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You only think she's weird because she's not white.
She decided not to pay the fine.

I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for it.
It's not right yet.
Quote me an example.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.

If I shower with hot water, I blurt out the mirror in the bathroom.
Tom took a picture.
Tom thought that Mary would be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.

You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask him for help.

I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?

You were wrong.
Good to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.

Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night.
I almost cut myself.
I'll be down here.

You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.

When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.

It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good about retirement.
Thank you for asking.
I have a good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Have him call me back.

We need to go find them.
Last time I was home on a Friday night when I was thirteen.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.

So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.

Let's just say for now that you're right.
Tom is doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about it.
I'll see you later.

Avoid excessive smoking.
Tom is a hairdresser.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.

Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is a lot like mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.

I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
What couldn't you sleep from last night?
They put a curse on us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just give him a call.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.

It's all over.
I'm sure.
Can you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You've lost some weight.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start over.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.

The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're overstating the problem.
Have you paid for it yet?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom rubbed his face.
What use do I have to you?
Let's take a closer look.
I like you better.
We don't have to follow her.
It turns me on when he wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.

I'm a zombie!
I was too late.
I could tell that Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom is quite harmless.
There's reports to write.
It hurts here.
You're making Tom nervous.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep so tomorrow you can finish up.
You jumped a button.

Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom sat alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that at all.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try.
I'm not misunderstood.
Tom is harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.

The cherry are wormy.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look pretty good.

She's been working since she was nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
It hurts like hell in here.
I hate this carpet.
I'm a little sick.
Tom was interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.

I'm thirsty for him.
She's lying at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.

Stop pushing me.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom is a nice man.
The eagle is the bird king.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you take a break?
You haven't asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom is nice.
The sky clears up.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.

Take care of our planet.
Tom relied on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom thinks you'd prefer a blue one.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked until two hours.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's on a roll.
His long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I can get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?

My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strongly.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the look of your hair.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.

This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is a mess.
Tom is the tallest guy in the class.
Tom, you've grown fast.
It was our only comfort.
No one would have cared.
Have you written in your diary today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it by myself?
Is this radio yours?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the keyhole, but couldn't see anything.
I couldn't take it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you limping?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there on time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.

Your faith is ugly.
I'm sorry I ever told them anything.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at 2:30.
Tom started drinking.
I slept in the boat.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold in short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any asian movies?
Did you get them?
The French language was the first of its kind.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here for them?
We can look in a dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
It can be done.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
Maybe you should help them.
I forwarded the schedule you sent me to Tom.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
We were rescued by the bell.
He trained me on the head.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems stunned.
The fun continues your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat smells bad.
Like I'm supposed to know you?
Tom carefully covered up all his mistakes.
Let me worry about you.
He can't come because he's sick.
No matter what, I guess.
She's a slow runner.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in misery.
Tom is fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just stole Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd have sold this dog if it was higher.
I'm gonna go help my friends.
Turns out Dan didn't have much to do.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom is a bum.
We despise her.
You got there before them.
Here, brother, half of it.
Tom slipped the new tablecloth he had just bought.
Tom will help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom is pissed.
The landscape is too perfect.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
The freedom of expression was strictly limited.
We'll have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating his victory with wine.
We don't have all week.
I'm going to try to get a handle on myself.
autumn is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
It only takes three minutes for the water to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where I can find him.
You're drunk!
It was so great.
Dan was dating Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to get into class.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, and they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of general human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning bolt.
They kissed each other.
I have a friend.
Tom likes to do everything himself.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
This soup is too salty.
Why don't you go get him?
Tom continued practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean yes or no?
Tom peeked into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
Seems familiar.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Scissors, sages, rosemary, timial, and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a discerning man.
Everything seemed okay.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
I don't get paid much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and books.
My brother and I shared the room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I can keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but she won't fool me!
Let's just get out of here.
Forget what I said.
Give him all of it.
I'm sick of it.
Tom reached into the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a pilehouse.
It's simple to solve this task.
They had to remove the bullet that was stuck in his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know how it probably sounds to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your parasol.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
I guess you don't know how it hurts to get stung by som.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegetarian before.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but there he is.
Tom is gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
Brushers don't help against ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
It seems that asking Tom would be out of the question.
My brother will arrive tomorrow morning.
You don't need to like everything.
Are the potatoes calorious?
They'll get one soon.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary by the turnip.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I like to make faces at him.
I waited outside for her.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and grow a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I got lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom threw a rock at me.
Everyone knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's Tom so mad about?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They stood in the air in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I've had a couple of reasons come to mind.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom never knew that Mary had cancer.
It was my fault.
I was hired to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would I be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm going to check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They've all gone wild.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I found out there's a movie called The Russians are coming!
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom isn't yet able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom is in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom has a baboob collection.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
Mice are plague carriers.
I'll call him in a few minutes.
Tom snuck out.
I'm starting tomorrow.
I haven't been honest with myself.
I've been looking for you.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I like roasted bones.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving and caused a car accident.
They hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary by waving.
That's okay.
Tom looks worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use this camera?
It snowed last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom is an accountant.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take about three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom is recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you in there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The President has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be sweeter.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I too early?
Sounds pretty cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom is old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his laces.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2:30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not rational.
The American women had no say.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
Trees are green.
Tom is dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom can't hear us.
Tom is a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom wandered off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you any more support.
Any objections?
Tom lay on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
It's an unsuspecting fact.
Does it taste good?
Look out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom frowned a little.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom surrendered to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Medellín.
Have you stopped beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't Tom stop?
I said I'd bring him.
Preservatives are a species of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomachs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the ox going?
She wiped her wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
I might not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of that.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom went to the next question.
That was considerate.
I want a life.
Tom isn't in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you to write well.
This area is located in a valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston among me.
Please check the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
I'm sorry, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary this morning.
I put honey on my toast in the morning.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went picking strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom kicked out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the meter.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Shut it all down.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'll lose weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
Tom can help you, too.
I wonder why we got married.
What's in it for us?
I'm with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a lovely bride.
Tom ought to be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick word.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were completely confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has many good casts.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom isn't good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to make amends.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm no match for you.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We don't hang out.
Where's the mailbox?
The Internet is a serious matter.
Mars is the red planet.
He hit the dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's already seven o'clock.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Like you wrote this book yourself!
Don't put that pepper in the soup.
Let's not be arrogant.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need Tom's help.
They were satisfied.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you must plow it.
Tom isn't well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
Nobody listens to you.
Okay, you've convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and lazy usually go together.
Tom didn't know that happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants got ripped off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
I said yes.
Tom admitted to spilling the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near a dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is a virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of Loire.
Tom is hopeless.
It's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'll help look for Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
It would be a pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff's here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs do I have to do a day?
Are you going to cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom is kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan disguised himself as a beggar.
You have very piercing eyes.
Is that not implied?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want them all shot.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
Will you get back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Finish it and then go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems wealthy.
Tom seems reliable.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom isn't friendly.
However, the amount is not correct.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The squares have four angles.
I kept working.
They've developed an addiction.
Would you like me to go with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and remained silent.
Bring a shovel.
You have a lot of different kinds of people here.
Mary took care of her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to pick up something at the supermarket?
The mass is over.
Tom wiped the blade on the knife from his jeans.
Tom struggled to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can make that happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just have her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer mug on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I could speak French.
He gave me an enticing view.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat the meat of a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should come by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'm just gonna buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom is lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked at me sharply through his glasses.
Linda accused Dan of stalking her.
Why would that bother them?
Let's not bother Tom.
This rope is tough.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't mean for that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave.
I need to set us free.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
I'm sick of it.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has struggled with depression at many times in his life.
Want me to take your bags?
I'd trust you with my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom never told me who his French teacher was.
The class went wild.
There were penguin footprints on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called a sweater.
I like to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to everyone that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
We need to talk face to face.
Tom isn't impressed.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope your new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the exam?
If you want quality, pay up.
Tom was chewing something.
She studies English.
With a dream like that, he'll become either a famous writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the bedroom windows.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit his chewing gum.
Let it be my way.
I got them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How'd you pull that off?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to develop bad habits!
She's started acting weird.
Likely, they will not pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she had developed an interest in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
You and I are both strong.
The president looked strong.
What should I buy?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I got here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a little tight.
You ran as fast as you could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is numb.
Grab the day.
What's Tom calling?
He's very handsome.
Let the buyer watch.
Tom often skips class.
Now it's time for compensation.
Most virgins have a hymen reading.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Since the bus was held, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll figure it out.
Does she have a dog?
I'm getting some rest.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to grab one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he could speak French better than he really does.
How long do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
I got my shoes wet.
That medication calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look foolish.
His mother is American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx began to circle around him.
We need your help finding her.
That means we can't eat bread anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom did a lousy job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked frustrated.
Please tell them what they should do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
I decide, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him.
It's working well.
Tom got ill.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here for him?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese to cow.
We understand that.
How's that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't had dairy products in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Is everyone having fun?
I was up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Shut the fuck up.
Same-sex couples shouldn't be able to get married.
The cow forgot it was ever a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
The sewing is manual.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear up the letter.
Let me try that.
Can you put out your cigarette?
What were they laughing at?
Why would you believe her?
Who's the girl sitting over there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a cab driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other lies.
I don't have any more money.
This chair is plastic.
Sunlight is supposedly the best disinfectant.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always soulless.
Get serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
He stood me up.
Have you called an ambulance yet?
After lunch, our plan is to take a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light went off.
John's at the airport.
Tom should've been ready an hour ago.
Make it a conscience now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Her charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need him now.
I don't know what you're doing here.
Blood runs through the body.
I'll get him to go.
This is a vertical line.
He always smells like mayonnaise.
It won't help a lie.
My toe hurts.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to get them presents.
What would the Prince want?
Where do we come from?
I really don't know.
Do you have a stopwatch?
Tom makes a noise for attention.
Dan had no compassion for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at that drawing.
Stone built their houses.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
I think we should talk about this now.
Meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't really think about such things.
It's windy.
I'm just kidding with you.
I don't know where that is.
We all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
I bought her a watch.
Just sit there.
Tom can hardly walk.
I thought you said you wanted to go with us.
I'm expecting visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you begin to manage?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom isn't very talkative.
You guys were right.

Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Let me know if you get a boyfriend.
It was remarkable.

That's close enough.
Tom is polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My efforts so far have been in vain.
"Why are you doing that?" "I can do anything."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom turned on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You may come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was sincere and reliable and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I won't give in.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not gonna slack.

I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.

I need to take them back a little bit.
The noise has turned the city upside down.
A person who loves flowers cannot be a bad person.

That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.

Time to get up.
This isn't your problem, it's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom might be wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom acts like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me about?
I think I've figured out what time we have to leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions. Second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who could blame him?
The audience seems bored.
I grow cattle.
She borrowed the liner.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has mustaches.

That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're evil and disgusting.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom can't see anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I drove by it, I didn't recognize it.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has got to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Ask him to join us.
It won't be easy to do that without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a nearby restaurant.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave her a sedative.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need some help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting divorced.
She's having dinner.
My jar is leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes snapped.
The geyser dumps hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give Tom all the money, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
I've always had someone help me.
They don't want that.
Tom is taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you contact him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy himself a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
Above all, be kind to older ones.
Jewels include aquamarine, amethist, emerald, quarttz, and ruby.
Go find them.
You have to ask your mother for permission before.
I'll take Tom's place.
What made you come to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
Stop slicing the chickens.
It was a beautiful day.
I got him to take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I had a quick lunch.
Tom remembered various things that no one else remembered.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'll go look for her.
Of all the languages I studied, French was the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I counted to 200.
Watch this.
Should I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
Butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you make?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you get the money on the loan?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I've got homework.
He breathed deeply.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman gets embarrassed easily.
Can you get there by car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what's right for me.
Tom has plenty of time.
I'll be fine.
I stepped on something weird.
When was the last time Tom came for a visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful bracelet.
Go see if Tom is in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom yelled at Mary.
Were you home alone?
He made a great deal of money out of her.
Can you help me figure that out?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only desire was to return and see her only daughter one last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it yourself?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make webs.
You really do talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what others say.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is single.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom is funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom staggered with pain.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're upset!
It seems to me that this is the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I'll do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound died down.
Who's been Fresting you?
I don't quite understand it myself.
Tom is a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I get there.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.

Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You need to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom is a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one's gonna get hurt.
Tom gave Mary a watch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice that Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his job.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that, too?
What have they found?
You lied to my eyes.
I'll go find her.
I wanted to wash up.
They're listening.
I wasn't aware that Tom had done that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just bother Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it in real life.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach so they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little hard of hearing, so speak louder.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom is heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It concerns you.
That's a very dry explanation.
The walk before breakfast is refreshing.
Since the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his harsh attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's quite simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt upside down.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is communicative, and sharing is not.
I'm teasing.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom is going.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what's in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom burped loudly.
It was worse.
Tom started snoring.
I'm going to ask you to stay for a while.
We keep two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed at her.
Tom might die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was freaked out.
This can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to listen to Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
The steam fogged my glasses.
So, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
It's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the Al's flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it'd be hard to pull off.
I think I found one.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom went without food for a week.
I don't really understand you.
Even though I'm a decent man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Is there a problem I should know about?
Tom needs to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so mad.
A lot of people hunt.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom is basically doing what Mary is doing.
We have to examine something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have a lot of time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your chest?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary shut him up.
We met at the pub.
How did Tom behave?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Nightlife is better in New York.
Please come in.
This medicine must be taken on an empty stomach.
Tom isn't in.
I guess it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
I didn't drop it.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was haunted.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
The marzipan pigs don't grunt.
Tom regained consciousness.
Tom angered Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom is good at it.
Tom might come today.
Tom doesn't know the difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't at home when I stopped by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, already.
Better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We got out of there at eleven.
You can ask me anything you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of cousins are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
You only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is from another dimension.
They're bothering me.
How's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don't think they have yet invented a cure for it.
Every member must attend.
You didn't get her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He's hoping to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have froze.
Who would want Tom to die?
Did you get his name?
Doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
Flour is made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on the subject.
You're fair.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are really cute together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What's happiness?
Dan wounded Linda's dog.
He cut his collarbone while he was playing.
I think Tom is funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
Show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom is blind.
Do you really believe this guy is a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was naughty.
This isn't an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom is dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegetarian diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I have to call her.
He asked me if I wanted to cook something.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom grow up.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerve over it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave him to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to get a hairdresser.
Tom must be crazy.
Let's do it again!
Doesn't hurt his heart.
There's no comment to be made.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom isn't that young.
That time, Tom swam.
This penguin is very cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look stunned.
I could make it easier for you.
Put the phone down.
I'd never walk out of my house in slippers.
I think Tom is a zepidlak.
He stabbed himself with a terrible infection and ovarian and swelling.
I don't need counseling.
This isn't right.
It's out of the question.
Tom headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting weird sometimes.
We'd hang them.
Now's probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a moment.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should be doing.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him now.
Stick to the subject.
She really likes to gossip.
I've got questions on tons.
This is an interesting, funny and even moving story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language sees the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pyjamas on.
This way.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom will want to go drinking with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We have everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he couldn't play tennis.
Where the hell did you find her?
This was on top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a heathen.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we had an argument.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you'd found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for Halloween?
I think Tom is dying.
I'm wet.
Are you shaking in it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked a cake for her.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people does he fit in this room?
I've already thought of that.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom is definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You twisted your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little shocked.
