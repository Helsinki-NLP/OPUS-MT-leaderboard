It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old father.
How do they treat you?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That'll take some time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look cold.
I feel like walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I come to you?
Do you like the bike?
He's a bread lover.
I feel like a fool.
Tom didn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's fire them.
How much is it worth?
The water was up to our necks.
Tom pretended he didn't notice Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Monday?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He's probably still got it.
She looked beautiful.
He was in a hurry.
What is this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is 7: 00 to 9: 00.
Tom's back last week.
Everyone was scared.
I've seen it so far.
You made a good choice.
The naducists find the nudity normal.
We sat there waiting.
I knew you'd like it.
I was kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist attitudes in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
That's mine.
Wolves stalked the herd.
That song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
The rapists are stupid.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever fired a gun before?
I love that tattoo.
For nothing, you got a ticket.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in this town.
What have they done so far?
Tom's reckless.
I don't live in Boston.
They were suing the government for the damage.
No one believes in Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
Why don't we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When was the robbery?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom was doing what Mary told him to do.
Show us where you found him.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition on that job is high.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom's aware he wasn't a good father, so he's trying to make amends.
Tom can't fake it.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have a confession to make.
His alcohol has affected him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's a little puffy in his cheeks.
Nobody cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would have said yes.
I'm supposed to help him.
He's critical.
You'll understand when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom spit his gum.
I really want your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to have a picnic with John.
Don't be rude to me.
I think it worked.
We didn't come from monkeys, we had a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
When do you usually eat lunch?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
All night long.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too much of a player for me.
I'll do it, if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rough.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop antagonizing Tom.
What could possibly go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was eating breakfast later.
Are you helping her?
Are you two cousins?
He likes egg ham.
Just put it on my tab.
I'd rather take a subway than a train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did you do your best?
Mary bribed the movie.
She's got nice handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary hit John.
Tom wrote this report himself.
Do you buy one of these?
He doesn't look so good.
Hey, can I have that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a second.
Take off your hat.
Acting is so good.
Please don't mumble.
Last night I saw a ghost.
I'm in London.
I won't be lonely here.
He asked me to look at it.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Do we really have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you do it the other way around?
Tom and Mary were speaking French.
He shaved.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know Tom and Mary were married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
My nose flows every time I catch a cold.
We've met a few times.
Nobody liked the soup.
The tree is green.
The moon's surface is irregular.
I'm trying to explain this to you the way you're going to understand it.
Everybody's looking for luck.
Anybody else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me awful in high school.
Tom wore a hat that still stood the price.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You have to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We should get help.
That's what the paper said.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree to that.
Tom would lend you money if I asked him to.
Tom is obedient and even obedient.
Where did Tom open it?
Mike said he was coming.
I'm just having a little fun.
I was gonna call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're humans.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried to do it herself.
Run!
Does it pay for delivery?
I want a refill.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass breaks easily.
Tom's bed is empty.
He has a weak heart.
Did you buy me those?
You didn't see that one, did you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
The mosquitoes are carrying malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's unfortunate.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you're doing, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We also receive checks.
This paper costs a dollar.
How did that get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one right.
Macedonia has four glagolic ways: level, conditional, command and rewritten.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The quiet surface reflected her features like a mirror.
I have three teens.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are correct.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's quite true.
Shouldn't we help him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember meeting the queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
How's the Japanese economy going to be next year?
That's exactly how I got in trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom started screaming.
This tooth needs a flask.
I have to think of myself.
I was trying to find him.
It's a big yard.
It's a children's game.
Tom, you're not feeling well.
I'll be back at six and a half.
Tom's fucking killing me.
I was only gone for an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
You've caused a scandal of good standing.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did it have to be you?
Don't draw attention.
I almost blacked out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or bull?
We ran out of gas.
Tom's a tralalaika.
Who do you have on the list?
He has a strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Should we wait here for him?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I go with you?
Tom looks a lot sleepy.
Tom is wasting a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about is food.
Make sure you don't get stuck in the muddy swamp.
They both cough.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't make dishes.
We weren't waiting for them.
Are the price meals included?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
Sona's here.
It can't be her.
Today is a very special day for them to try to escape.
Everybody went crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good show.
Tom, the police have already questioned him.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom left.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
I guess you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you won't help him?
Tom's got the room.
There are no survivors.
She should have kept her mouth shut.
I'm not like you!
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They laughed quietly.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I was slapping him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than a hundred people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king found it particularly difficult to make speeches, because of the heavy-spoken flaw.
She didn't accept the invitation.
Tom seemed surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
This place is too heavy.
Weather is defective.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels worked in vain to sink the submarine.
Your doctorate must be written in English.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then run away.
He's got a great deal on him.
When do you study?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It's worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is reckless.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by cannibals.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't look busy.
We'll get right on that.
Didn't you hear me yelling?
Let's go for a walk.
Don't get too excited.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Remove the clip.
I don't have any plans for tomorrow.
Tom got ahead of himself to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep his promise to me.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
Look at the smoke.
I'm glad you're glad.
They're dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the stars that shine.
I don't know how to help him.
Buckle up.
Get him to confess!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay inside here.
Shut up, Albert. Your theory sucks.
Bankroach.
Everybody knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like this school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the lights.
When do you need to update your passport?
Mary doesn't have the guts to face Tom directly.
My son is not a snob.
It's from Tom.
There's not a speck of height in his story.
The battle was brief.
I'm so retarded!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Have them call me.
Electricity heater hot ceramic tiles from the bathroom floor.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm sick of this war.
In the woods, monkeys came down from the canopy.
Let's forget about it for now.
Because of his father's sudden death, he gave up his plans to live abroad.
You're quick to receive data.
You can't give up.
Didn't you get one?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know about that.
At first I couldn't stand it.
He's got his sleeve attached.
I didn't think you'd like it, Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know it yet.
I'm gonna stay here and help him.
Quiet!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he wasn't cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you played chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are clogged.
I offended you, didn't I?
Tom can't drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They knocked right beside him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
Kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone I died.
I think we found one.
The deadline for the reports is next Monday.
My baby wants to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly examined the situation.
Tom's just a regular guy.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We need to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do it.
The water hit my knees.
Let's make a cake.
I need you to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
Sylvia loved the concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where do I park?
Does anyone care?
How's that your fault?
Tom drank a bottle of wine.
I fell out of a bike.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in this book?
Do you mind?
When does this show start?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are open.
Tom talked Mary into donating money.
I got it with me.
Weren't you named Cookie the Old Dog?
I just bought a boat.
But you lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom started laughing.
This is Tom's school.
I don't feel so good today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did you ask her for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It's a more factual process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom's not shy at all.
Tom ran down the street.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Sentiv's really eager.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
That happened nearly thirty years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that before.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I have to find a way to help them.
Can Tom swim?
Do you have a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold weighs more than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is anybody in there?
Have you read this?
And what if they say "no"?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom was gonna panic.
Tom was 30.
She almost got to go.
You should try this.
I'm expecting a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom's struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What's that smell?
Anyway, you didn't get what you hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it that obvious?
Tom seriously needs help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that comforting?
Tom put his hands out.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says his previous dentist told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don't expect everyone to share your opinions.
That's exactly what Tom suggested.
Kind of seems wrong to me.
Tom's a smart guy.
The powder curry is a mixture of more spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a very difficult night for me.
Tom was driving around town with the crack brake without noticing.
Yeah, anyway.
Do you like camping?
Who broke the toilet?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to shut Mary off the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Save it for yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty high.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher must be rolling over in his grave right now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and they don't realize that their own behaviour is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make himself taller.
Do you like bowling?
Excuse me, I think you dropped something.
You just need to talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I like to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't make a fuss.
I'm here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
What difference does it make?
We finally meet, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house isn't big enough for our family.
You gave up the idea.
I must sound ridiculous.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so stubborn.
Did someone hit Tom?
We got one rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom's not going to be very operational.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom used improper expressions.
Your coffee's pumping energy!
Tom was a nice man.
It's a big sword for football.
Why did you ask me that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I fear the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works for NASA.
Tom already writes.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom does his homework.
Dan didn't feel safe in his own home anymore.
Tom already told me.
They have to let the idea go.
Tom's really pissed off.
Why did you leave so suddenly?
We all experience her behavior as repulsive.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose squad is this?
Avoid her.
His eyes sparkled with rage.
Why were you yelling?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to set up our tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
Tom may have cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve everything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him about.
You gave your word.
If you're ready to go, so are we.
I want you to keep your promise.
I can see that no one needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I like to travel." "Me too."
There's a lot of birds in these woods.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
She was just about to meet me, Tom.
You need to get help.
I'll never tell you.
It's possible that Tom is richer than we thought.
I never intended to trick you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't want to.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your soy.
You said you were sorry.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking means suicide.
The hardliners, the butterflies and the cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's build a fire.
I wanted to get this to you as soon as possible.
What's your hat?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom took off his knee.
Where do the pawnals come from?
Can I talk to you upstairs?
It's made of leather.
I have to rest.
Can I look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took his coat off.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom performed, and the crowd clapped.
I think that's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he didn't make it.
Dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda.
I want to find Tom.
He's also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize that guy.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where tom is.
That was very touching.
Get her inside.
You're cooking turkey with pears.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going, so what does it want to be?
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
Dan took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I quit smoking classes.
I know how it sounds.
Tom didn't seem to mind sitting alone.
I feel much better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
Too bad the concrete's not burning.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped at once.
My father used to take me here when I was young.
You're such a nerd.
Let go of the bottle.
I'm gonna try and find Tom.
I knew I should have kept my mouth shut.
I'm on the hook.
Tom got here early.
He waxed his wet clothes by the fire.
He's always bragging with his English skills.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have any roofs?
No part of the pig has failed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that your last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What happens next?
Put him in a psychiatric hospital!
You should give them some space.
Cars have four wheels.
Tom's passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom packed his bags.
What good is that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I've decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not going back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I was doing last night.
The girl was walking slowly.
It turns out you're unexpectedly crafty.
You can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go so well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom didn't have lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I couldn't read it.
They made him do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
This room is packed.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open the phone.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you get back to work.
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom's still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear.
Tom made Mary laugh.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom, think about it.
I don't mind waiting here at all.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your necklace.
That doesn't have a high priority.
Take this.
What is it now?
Got it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You won't make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your precious eyes.
I was ready for the war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I'll never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
It's the first cockroach I see this spring.
Do you want to dance?
Why did you fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom looks cheerful.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Take care!
Linda was sick and suspected that she was pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2: 30 on the main gate.
The meeting started more than an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I can.
I have money.
You can study here.
They didn't tell Tom why Mary wasn't there.
Tom fixed everything.
Tom threw the arrow.
They're not coconuts.
I'm not safe here.
On my great grief, Mary came to the slumber dress party.
I'll say whatever you want me to say.
I hope it's useful.
Don't say anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
The beekeepers remove the saviour to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I won't forget this.
Tom won the fight.
If you'd brought them here right now.
Tom lives abroad.
Is this where they work?
Tom had his eyes lit when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you even help us?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't look quite possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl says hello to me with a smile.
There are a lot of big cities in Brazil.
I haven't solved that puzzle yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom was wiggling his toes.
You know me better than it seems.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He's got a lot of problems.
This is not blue, this is purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they eat people.
Could you get this arrow out of my leg?
I've forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that?
He spends his money on the water.
We don't give you anything.
I guess I just didn't think so.
I'm not really convinced.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times you shouldn't overdo it.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
This book weighs.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just saying be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms in this hotel are obviously very bad-mouthed sounds, and I hear him in the next room chew gum!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's go for a walk in the market!
Try to be an optimist.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the keyhole.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you holding on to me?
Please talk to me.
Angels guard us and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
Therapy didn't help.
My grammar's weak.
Tom was at his service.
Tom's going into town.
I'm interested in Japanese culture.
This is Yava.
Who saw me?
Tom's closing in.
Tom's the real hero.
Where'd you come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary everything about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done.
These goats are vicious.
Tom went fishing.
Tom never thought of trying to convince Mary to do it for a second.
Let's go to a mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his locker.
Maybe we're related.
I feel bad for not calling you.
Can I use this pen?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why do you ask?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don't tell your parents about it!
He was standing in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom's always been very protective of his kids.
I asked her the same question.
We had to look for a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen handkerchiefs.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look weird.
That's why I can't help you.
I haven't found the time to write that report yet.
I can do it without it.
There are those who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
He's dressing up.
Tom threatened Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love walking by the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a little expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Come down.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a shame.
Tom nodded.
I don't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm thirty years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
Can you dive?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
What about a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the meetings.
It was a horrible sight.
Dan's knife was laced with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
Today at noon, we'll be having intestines from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
Watch out, it's a tough bull.
I'm gonna take Tom home.
I've been gone three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on the shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's dead drunk.
I need some sun cream.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
Tonight's good for me.
They were traveling east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the landlord.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramics that fell off the roof were ripped to pieces.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped her clean the tub.
Stop by anytime.
Tom was gonna kick us out.
Tom wasn't embarrassed.
Just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You better go.
Tom blew the exit.
I've got two aces.
What are you up to?
Dan admitted to Linda being a hard drunk.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put his drink down.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to find it difficult to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm no use to you here.
Did anyone hurt yourself?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary scream.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
The Amemas are a firecracker.
You do that to me, I'll cut your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes for a swim every day.
This doesn't mean Tom's dead.
The waves are creating the wind.
Get a clean glass of the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of it matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a possibility they'll kill.
I left her a message.
Is that all you've seen?
That would be a disaster.
I like how French write their word "ladybug."
The jack can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too risky without any help.
Are you good for that?
We're pretty good.
Pork is cut on dice and fried.
Ask a professional face.
I love trips.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom was apparently trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
This book hasn't been translated in French yet.
Tom's here.
Gangsters have extorted a large amount of money from the rich.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You got a bit of a conscience, don't you?
I twisted blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Take a handkerchief, your nose dripping.
Tom was going with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were farmers originally.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do anything that you regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We've set up a tent.
I didn't think it would rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
He was begging to stay.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did this happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still dressed in his pajamas and bathrobe when I got here this morning.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're pissed.
The line isn't exactly grammatical.
I can't convince Tom.
I can walk.
They invited me to their wedding.
Are there any other questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary's first teacher.
There's a fountain in the middle of town.
You have to help her.
The reader will soon realise that my analysis is accurate and her results are up to date.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the road.
Don't interrupt Tom.
No more blankets.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts failed.
He's doing the best in math.
They were so happy together.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
You put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't have liked that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in weird things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary he saw John with Elise.
You hurt me and you called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find it?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's superstitious.
Some fish can change their sex.
I can take it from her.
Bring food.
It might be hard.
I don't curse their children.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom went to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
Makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and every funeral the deceased.
Tom's probably fine.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Do you want to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom wasn't surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climatic conditions are not for the half.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please do your best.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out a pen.
Why should I be interested in what you're doing?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Should we arrest Tom?
How long do you have to drink this medicine?
I don't need a bed.
Put us on Facebook!
Did you get us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are really happy don't take their luck.
I don't know what to do yet.
Just get out of my way.
Please show me more.
I should paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I teach him English.
Usually what is the cause of pain?
We're addicted to work.
This box is made of pelay.
She failed the test for a reason.
Trust your intuition.
He can't do that.
You weren't listening.
Tom's evil.
Try not to pay any attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
There was crap; there was a lot of semen.
Tom is such a pain in the ass.
I had a flu shot.
Just try it.
I want to play, too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one-legged.
Is Tom interested?
Here it is.
I want to talk to you about Tom for a second.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I've never surf.
I'll find something.
We had turtle soup.
We can work out in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you stashed Tom Jewels.
That cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're experienced.
What's not wrong with her?
It's not a common pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They'll pay us well.
Tom seemed distracted.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
You beat the shit out of me.
I'm not a co-pilot.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the weirdest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of my day here.
Should we wait here for her?
If you go out like that, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
That was pretty funny.
I set him up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did Tom say anything?
Is everyone busy?
They don't want people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's make this simple.
Tom got shot.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We were making a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Pass me the wine.
All the stores are closed.
You've been doing white again!
Stop pushing your dick.
Tom's finished with the dishes.
That's not what happened.
Be a man.
It's an inexorable drama.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go alone.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Is Tom getting along with his associates?
That smells like cheese.
Guess what.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always give it your best shot.
Dan was encouraging Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
What's the shortcut from?
Thanks again for coming.
They're cheating on us.
The wounded soldier was barely walking.
The sun just came up.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you give me a hug?
What's stopping Tom from doing it again?
Tom does a lot of movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's discreet humor.
Light is rejected by water.
Tom's mouthed the soup.
I'm not fucking you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the objects on the table.
The police threw Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Can I touch you?
Is there something wrong with you?
Let a man cry.
Are you going to help him?
We used to go by the trees.
I'll do it anyway.
I knew you'd stand on Tom's side.
He couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
I feel bad for not calling them.
Pray to God, not to his prophets.
Tom acted like a cavalier.
Now we're even.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I have to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch at noon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more polite.
Have fun with Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This is going perfectly.
You used to use your hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is specific.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give any gift to Tom.
Tom was diligent.
Tom lived right next door to me when I was a kid.
Tom's putting his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the skirt.
Should I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary are probably never gonna see each other again.
Let's take a look.
The european likes to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He's got a lot of debts.
She knows the major capitals.
What's under the covers?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's got drinks for everybody.
Are you ready to go?
Tom's obviously gone mad.
Tom approached them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs racketeering questions?
Mary was proud of her meadow.
Teacher teaches.
I wasn't even here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I have my passport.
It was a masterpiece they used to talk about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have any pen.
When do we have to start worrying?
I've thought about what Tom said.
Tom likes vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They deduced that the ship had sunk nowhere else.
Did you buy the cure?
Has Tom been drinking?
I don't give a shit.
The question is, who's going to do it?
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Is everybody happy?
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I should call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
It's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what is it now?
I'm not embarrassed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He walks to school.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't get over nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very conceited.
Now the question is, what should we do?
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished fourth of 56 runners.
Don't make a fuss.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a kid, he became obsessed with the girl living on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
Sounds pretty good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom's got Mary's silence all mixed up.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Start a wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to mess with Tom.
They'll never take you to that club.
Tom wasn't born blind.
Is he looking for Tom?
There's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom hasn't called.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me alone.
These animals are threatened.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the gate open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
They all turned around to watch her.
Don't you dare ask them that.
That can't be true.
Tom's done.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We've heard very carefully so that we don't miss a word.
I already have plans this weekend.
Why are you so upset tonight?
Tom fell for the bad guys.
We're overconfident.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late for compensation.
Is the house ready?
Tom's gutters are hilarious, and they get even better once he drinks a couple of beers.
You have millions of eyes.
You don't know business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Oh, yeah, it's gonna get fixed... when the willow tree has grapes.
Tom's a consultant.
Can I talk to you?
You insulted me by calling me a donkey.
Since when do they have fireworks?
It's possible that Tom might be lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same thing you do.
I didn't betray anything.
I was just thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
I'm losing my hair.
The big question that no one found answer to, including me, despite thirty years of lady's soul research, is, "What do women want?"
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
Villagers reap harvest.
Tom's not gonna like that.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
Kolka's a deep breach?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the coffee table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've looked everywhere.
What was the object?
Every time we break up, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Are you tired of me?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarian.
Tom was hilarious.
Tom needed advice.
My laser printer can also scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe it?
Maybe Tom doesn't understand how valuable that painting is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not the criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Good luck to me!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We went looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Wait a second.
I have something to do with.
Your propaganda is not interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every shade is lost while translating.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
No comment.
I think he's hiding something.
I hope there's quite a bit of air in here.
She married zero by human.
The wind's gone down.
Nothing's changed.
You're not supposed to dress up for shit.
The old man was separated before he died.
I don't feel like this book.
Luckily, I slammed him.
What would Tom ask for that for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I got the measles.
Can someone help me?
We'll leave this afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you Google it?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't bother me, Tom.
How old is this TV?
This mystery is solved.
Tom got accepted to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most of the United States.
Well, there's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's true.
Are you sure we don't have to make an appointment first?
One who can hear butterflies laughing knows what clouds taste like.
We were playing golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't deal with them.
They pulled a toothpick to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You have a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not about to suffer like goods!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be so scared.
Have you ever worked as a bartender before?
Have you forgotten that again?
I don't like it at all.
I just got off work hours.
Where will this production be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food cools, heat it up in the microwave.
The creek's on our right.
Tom's not an old man.
This looks too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he saved.
I think it's time for you to go now.
This guy's a bandit.
It's possible that Tom saw it.
Tom's got a little hook.
Tom is very immature.
What are they up to?
How do you find volume on a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's drinking.
They took over your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a rematch.
Tom put a fork in the socket.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are kind of mammals.
Dan beat Matt to death and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I completely understand.
Tom seems really shaken up.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, how about you?"
Thank you all for coming.
Tom said he didn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's about to rain.
This will significantly make our job easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
You took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do it.
Her mother speaks Italian.
I'm on vacation here.
He's got wine.
His feelings weren't returned.
You're not so young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably just lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you want to know, let me know and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he couldn't do much about it.
I like this.
Roll up your sleeves.
I can't believe we actually did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
I'm really good at that.
Does it hurt much?
I just want to be able to support my family, as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I got a bunch of questions.
Who's running things around here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every people have their own language.
I would never take it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
The way it came - the way it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
Everything stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The significance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me this place on a map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom's gone to the pilgrimage.
Eyes forward.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Is it bothering you, Tom?
This is my latest draft.
I haven't been feeling well in two days.
This is a waste, it's too easy.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have invented it.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a mule and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
Getting out of the rain is out of the question.
I'll have them leave right now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got an azalen.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
It's been a while since I've seen you guys.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom shot Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes any sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of a mushroom poisoning?
And what are you even doing here?
Don't despair.
I like to watch lesbian porn.
And who the hell are you?
Tom wants Mary to make sure John does his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom got worried right away.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I expected a little better.
I believe it already.
He's writing his mother a letter.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom acted surprised.
The boy was impossible to swim across the river.
Tom got here early from Mary.
It felt mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old cabin has a certain charm.
This is taboo.
We barely made it out.
Did they hire you?
Gas leak.
Tom could see Mary sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little freaked out.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you could cruise for a year.
Tom was motivated.
You may have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
I'm such a coward.
Brother, you can't just walk up to a woman and cheer her up - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her that I love him.
Find your supernatural power.
I'm first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
Your loss.
We've wrapped the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sedated.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was a real pain in the ass.
I'm a patient man.
That's not what's happening here.
It's better to be an optimist and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
The water was too thin.
I'm waiting for the light to change.
The boy kept his mouth shut.
The ship's hull is divided into more challenging parts.
Since you've been cooking, I'll be doing dishes.
Let's leave this subject alone.
Tom knows something he's not telling us.
When are you coming home?
They were attacked.
You can't lose focus.
It's got fake eyelashes.
I'm not gonna wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't like to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear a knock?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Let's not!"
He's not the same shy guy he used to be.
Contash?
Don't make a scene now.
What was told to Tom?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never evil.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
There were boys divided into groups everywhere, some played marbles, some flask, some with a ball, others drove a bike or rode wooden horses.
Doubt destroys friendship.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was blacked out.
I worked for them.
There's not much milk left in that bottle.
We both need to go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
Nice of you to buy Tom a nice present like that.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Let me check the manual.
The energy comes from inside.
Nobody believed them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
You knocked your head off.
We're screwed.
Put the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This isn't normal.
Can I talk to you tomorrow?
Tom's making himself clear.
I don't find the equation.
They're listening to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how that got in there.
I'm not happy.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm angry.
Today is less moist than yesterday.
It's hard for me to make new friends.
It's funny how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Aren't you gonna do anything?
Tom didn't have a family.
I can't tell who wants the baby, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Even though he's rich, he's not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom's caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go pick up Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
It's a fake lead.
Tom fought.
I said it might rain.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like that has ever happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Can you fix the bathroom?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
Are you Russian?
I'll give her one more chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Her skirt has a snip on one side.
Let's get something to eat.
I'll be right out.
What's your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can't even read or write.
Tom hurt his leg.
Go inside.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everybody's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom's doing?
We all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna be out of jail eventually.
The most expensive thing is land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of the things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
You've brought us food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you resisting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why won't anyone help him?
Destroy this temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask a question.
I'm gonna ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn't know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Consider how much money we're gonna need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much is that thing over there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
You're up at 6: 00?
Tom sat down again.
What state is Boston in?
Tom's very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of his computer.
That would be a tragedy.
When I had a lung lighter, I just brushed in my room, waiting for my recovery.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom played the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You heard right.
Tom's got a headache.
Well, let's not.
There's no one here.
That's not advisable.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to quit.
You did your best.
He's a cadet.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom has to do.
Mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not taking that chance.
This house needs repairs.
I'm impressed, Tom.
Tom's an errand boy.
Tom's not listening.
They want everything you told them now.
Tom wrote stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, women and men are completely different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the deal?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never love you.
He made it look easy.
You'd better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well's dried up.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
Maybe you should call them.
No, some people like it.
According to our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What's there to do with this?
Is your dog barking?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I like German donuts so much.
We were 18 years old back then.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I like broccoli, but I hate carphil.
I get restless watching him with his girlfriend.
Tom ran away.
Get on with it.
This is disgusting.

Tom started to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Stand down.
You're good-Iooking.

Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
You done already?
How long has it been?
It's not burning.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, preferably.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
Tom's a joker.
I've had a lot worse.
Tom has struggled to remain calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be lazy.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Are you there yet?
I only had one drink.
Nobody writes me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I ask.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mom told him not to talk with his mouth full.
They all got under control.
Every customer has their rights.
I'm just calling to hear from you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What was the last thing you did?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
This statement is wrong: I'm going to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They have bewitched us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't get invited to parties often.
He doesn't look like his father at all.
Tom's not really attached.
It was after midnight.
It's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Have you changed your shampoo?

Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remind them of their debts.
I don't want to get tangled up.
Their friendship quickly transformed into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.

Tell me who you saw.
He lives over there, on the Ridon.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
It's almost Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom was obviously used to this kind of trouble.
You'll be all right.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the fly.
You hardly ever went there.
Tom's stiff.
Let's sing and dance.
After war, the winners are always right and the winners are the ones who are responsible.

I'm just gonna sit here.
You wouldn't happen to have a key, would you?
Let's be realistic.
A lemon tea, please.
Tom doesn't have a job.
Maybe this will help.
I hate him just as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came in and found me, his whole body used to rust on alcohol.
Tom's on his way.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is tight.
I'm not leaving with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a little outfit.
I'll make sure we finish this project in time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?

Yesterday she stayed up late.
You're back.
They were all silent.
What exactly happened between us?

It's not just a guess.
How do we find them?
It may seem strange.
No one can be saved from death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?

When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom's become famous.
I got this song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.

I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
Nobody's gonna find me.
Tom's really pissed off.
What kind of situations would you use him in?

Where was Tom born?
You must hurry to catch the last train.
Please check the room.

Tom's not really old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
Children need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had the camera with me.
It'll be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You have to guard the child.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabbed a weapon.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm feeling a little sick.
Who made this box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's go slide.
You're allowed to sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me feel better.
I hear they pay pretty good.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you get something to eat?
Boston is a fabulous city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does he collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There could be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
This circle is green.
Tom had a penchant for what he said to Mary.
Go find him.
It's in the basement.
Tom's getting cold.
I get you.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'm gonna scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom brushed his hair.
They all sat down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and go back.
I don't feel comfortable walking.
She seems a little young to get married.
I hate this school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
Let's get started.
His brother is more patient than he is.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So, I'm serious.
No talking during the test, people.
It was necessary.
Donate all you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do it.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a break.
I let you get me.
You should write Tom a letter of thanks.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light has faded.
Come on!
And if Tom says no?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wanted to have breakfast in bed.
Dan's walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I flipped the lamp.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's exactly what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's close.
We were worried about you.
Experience is not inherent - everyone gains their own.
I want to believe Tom was happy.
That's how you stretch it when you wash it.
The truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom started talking.
I ran away for an hour.
Tom's still tied up.
Have you ever read this before?
Without bait, it would be hard for me to fish.
Tom was napping.
I think it's good dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.

He's a strict critic.
I've cured my cold with this cure.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball at the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a really good place.
I have a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because the time was cold.
It's not necessary.
I just wanted to clear the situation.
Tom's wearing new shoes.
I'll take it.
You can't get this way to Tom's house.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life away in the Himalayas.
Tom's out of his mind.
Please repeat.
You're so dramatic.
Tom's got the hang of it.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She was at school.
They say Maria Antoinette was responsible for the French revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's awesome.
Why don't you buy more than one of these?
We tried.
Oh, that's so cool!
We're like brothers.
Let me fix you something.
You got too much work to do.
Could that be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I'm humming on your softeness.
He was voted mayor of Boston.
Police found footprints at the crime scene.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom saved the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is, who's going to tell him?
Tom next to Mary was sitting.
Tom must not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a striptease.
I'm gonna have to try and handle this on my own.
They were dreaming of the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than 30 messages yesterday.
Do you know for a fact that this is not made diamonds?
You let Tom get away.
What's the answer?
Did I say I was done?
Tom doesn't like a girl wearing high heels.
You wish you knew.
I looked at her.

We're friends with him.
I may have admired others, but I never cared about being anything other than who I am.

Why are you calling?
They spoke quietly.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to speak French.
We have to go back.
I mean it.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom's got a little dick.
Tom believed everything Mary said to him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going, period.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's just as tall as she is.
They were chasing them.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much that costs?
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There wasn't a soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig any wells for you.
I only have a few minutes left.
Wait a minute.
Tom loves you so much no matter what.
You cook well.
There's no shortcut to the top, just to the breach.
Tom's pretty weak.
His surface was flat like a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom gets paid a lot.
It was unfortunate.
I can tell you cared about her.
Come dance with me.
I've already asked them all.
Automatic automobiles are now ubiquitous.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's a new paper.
I hit Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I must be punished.
Who ate my lunch?
The eagle was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
His aunt eats an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do what I tell you to do?
I'm making scrambled eggs.
I want the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take bribes.
Don't sugar my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a teddy bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there's no pornography with that, it'll be done.
I've been calling for hours.
She passed away a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the bagpipes?
She was well-groomed.
What does it all mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
It was my duty to spend the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a bum.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census took place in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
He said that by texting me last night, but he lied to me, obviously.
Shoot.
He took off his clothes to bathe.
A sweat line started pouring into my face.
Mary gave up her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just let it go.
I'm taught math.
Caves are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
What was your name?
Movies are a great distraction.
At first I couldn't see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love jazz.
They're staring at you.
I would do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan to leave.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone laughed.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
They canceled our flight due to adverse weather conditions.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat there patiently.
Pigs use microphones to make their voices louder.
They might be coming back.
I'm so scared!
The entire board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Get over here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'm gonna go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom built a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid bad societies.
The airport's just around the corner.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut my finger off.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get that bad.
The cork's not coming out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to look after Mary.
Mary likes to have hot coffee, and Tom likes to drink hot coffee.
I gave her a fake address.
I got my shit together.
I don't feel well anymore.
There's a good chance Jane will be here.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
It matters to me how you feel about Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom just froze up.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you make that up, Tom?
What do I need a lawyer for?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom started talking.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really gonna try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy it?
She looked awful.
They're all liars.
How can someone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
Everything's quiet again.
It's an insignificant mistake.
I really hope so.
Get your shit together.
I'm in a lot of trouble right now.
Answer me now.
Let me help.
Tom has anger issues.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a whole new man.
Get me a drink.
I think I might have caught a cold.
The question is, can or can't.
Tom ran upstairs.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I've done.
It's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you only went out with girls that were lower than you.
I need to tighten my seat belt.
Tom almost crashed with Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some burgers.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
Have you talked to Tom yet?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is no place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He's put out a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm weaker and weaker.
The cake looks nice.
Did anyone break your heart?
That's how I feel.
What made you sad?
We want to see Tom.
Where the hell was Tom?
Who won the prize?
Please come on time.
Germans have a looser attitude to nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny it.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan paid a visit to the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you won't help us?
When their leader died, they placed his body in a great grave.
Women love men with mustache.
Did you forget your wallet again?
Do you accept a tip?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do it, then who will?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud lightning bolt.
Both screamed.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for a kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I didn't get any luck.
His body was shaped with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now get in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The island's settlers are friendly.
Let's try it with Tom first.
I've always liked mysterious characters more.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to have pineapple for breakfast.
I meant to tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of America's most prominent songwriters.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't use Tom.
Tom might never come back here again.
Nobody likes a crybaby.
You were crying about a toy.
He tried to climb a far mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I would if I could.
Tom's such a kook.
Try explaining that to Tom.
We're the first ones to arrive.
I already gave her your number.
The soap burned my eyes.
Good to see you all again.
Tom really liked Mary.
Tom tasted the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
Everything is very informal.
This isn't the right way.
I know I can do more than that.
You learn fast.
We've had some really nice food.
Tom's been unemployed for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I got beat up.
Nobody's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one of those.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly garbage bags.
I'm suffering from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he was traveling to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where he hid Tom the diamonds?
Is everything there?
Tom ran out of his passport.
You deserve a medal.
They're so strong.
How come you made a mistake like that?
It's a good memory.
Is he allowed to do whatever he wants?
The time has come to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was planning on voting for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know any French.
Why did you go there?
Clean him up.
Tom's still not fully aware of what happened.
Coke's a drug.
This is a little harder.
Apparently, you already know the answer.
Could you give us a ride?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who's the owner of this ship?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
You've been of great use to us.
What do you usually do on your own time?
I'll come and rescue you.
I got a pebble in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We got drunk.
Who made the doll?
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
Her long hair was flat brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for handles.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't go in my room.
That's where we started.
I didn't mean to brag.
There was no need to talk.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his connection?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got a couple of donuts.
I'm learning French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the bottom floor.
Girls won't play tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom's ingenuity.
We have to call Tom.
They'll hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's just leave him alone for a second.
I never wear suits.
The heater is broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is mostly poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it, too.
Women love men with mustache.
We spent the afternoon fooling ourselves on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People die all the time.
That nickname looks perfect on him.
Can you make it stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
You pulled your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom made a rough move.
Tom seems a little down this morning.
Nobody understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom got kicked by a mule.
Tom passed away a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss that subject with you.
Did you ask them for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works at the bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onions.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and graciously bowed.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Marco thinks it's already written.
Tom looked at it.
My ears are ringing.
I'm using an opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very orderly.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a punk!
Who makes him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complex.
Tom wouldn't back down.
Tom got suspended.
They made out.
She's going to be a teacher.
I have no intention of telling Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was terrible.
Tom seems indifferent.
Something's strange.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That's all we know about them.
Do you think that bothered us?
Maybe we can get help in the nearest village.
We hope she's okay.
You're capable, but you're faking.
She worked at an embassy three months ago.
We're on vacation.
Maybe we'll get a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom got violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's running out.
It's work.
We'll manage.
The pleasantries encourage students to work harder.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom's about thirty years old.
What's the matter?
I can see how upset you are.
Okay, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan was attacked by two men.
Tom measured himself on a scale.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom's changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's messed up.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "Lady" was used solely for nobles.
Tom's been teaching French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak for yourself.
Can you believe that?
How can he choose a man just one?
I came to feed them to Tom fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I can't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on his bloodstained bed, with a dagger carved deep into his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
It couldn't be safer.
How long are you staying with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay for a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your kids' mix.
Tom was more specific about how Mary and I were doing something.
Just leave us alone.
Tom's pretty lazy.
Tom usually wins fights.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder leak?
Stay out of business and pleasure.
I work in Boston now.
He put a crown on the King's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy working.
I'll introduce you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your zipper's been unlocked.
This is one of mine.
There's nothing stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got off the couch.
Don't piss Tom off.
I turned on the fan and I pointed it against the wall.
This is a home jam.
Tom asked Mary for help.
No examples.
Just give me one day.
The police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom's writing really well.
That's not quite true.
Rats are small.
Please stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm sick of Boston.
Tom had a bad headache.
As soon as he increased it, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked in.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank loaned the company a million dollars.
I still have a lot to tell you.
I always write it down.
What are the terms?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I will do my best to destroy it.
Play it more relaxed.
My son always stops me talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive myself.
I guess I drank too much last night.
Tom was checking himself out.
Tom said he didn't think of the name of the guy.
I'm gonna reach out to your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm curious about the sport.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you have a book to lend me?
Tom was moving very carefully.
Just go inside.
It's a steel sword.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I told my own story.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When are we gonna see each other?
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's the only one.
A woman calls her husband.
Tom really found something interesting.
There were so many of them out there.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan's going out.
I don't even know which one it is.
I'm not calling them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't take it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their point?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
They put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are the following.
This is the pool Tom learned to swim in.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to meet me outside the post office.
What college have you studied at?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I broke a blood vessel in my eye.
Tam visited Mary yesterday.
You overdid it!
He's got a son who's disappeared.
I'm trying to work.
How do you like it?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a hunch that the play will quit; they haven't sold anything many cards.
Tom's on his way.
Tom feels he shouldn't be using deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go do your homework.
Don't make the child eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're laughing.
Tom paid me.
It's my intention to read books.
He was executed.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting all crazy.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Give me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We must always support our children.
Everyone has their flaws.
Tom was behind the wheel.
What are we doing with them?
Tom knew what Mary was planning to cook for dinner.
What do you see here?
I got the feeling it's been raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom seem upset?
They'll probably come in the car.
I appreciate it.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Even though Jane had one case less than me, she complained she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's an expert.
Excuse me for a second.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in this orange.
Tom's here to help.
It's been too long.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to take the water.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're so lonely.
Please don't add your comments.
That was Tom's only flaw.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
The lightning usually escort the thunderstorms.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I go with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom took him to the ground.
This teaching thing has no end!
The glasses are in the cup cabinet.
Give us some time.
Tom was wondering why Mary didn't want to mess with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while driving a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the shrink.
How come you're not asleep yet?
Everybody knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn't have the guts to try it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They made love.
I burned the waste.
We've both seen him.
That would be rude.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famed conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
There are only two seasons in the tropics.
I think I spoke nicely.
I'm replacing it.
Look at the watch.
Isn't this too soon?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
As a matter of fact, I'm back in line with my ex-boyfriend.
Just get this job done.
I think Tom is wonderful.
Tom got a little pie.
What's Tom doing?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he can play tennis, but he won't play tennis.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign say over the door?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
My hair and the way she keeps her head, they remind me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
We're looking for them now.
My shoes soaked.
Tom would say something back.
She always works hard.
What country are you on?
The ivory trade is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting Tom.
I prefer cat dogs.
There's still some space in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary had painted her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom can't swim yet.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you took such good care of Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom is the father.
You know what I need.
You can't hold on to this heat.
These two seem to have calmed down.
I'm afraid I can't allow that.
I need you right away.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We had no money.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're funny, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
That's not what I wanted.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep working.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you can say that.
I can't handle this assignment.
I guess we'll just have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you doing in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're doing almost everything together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary yell at John.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits long.
Go with the crutches.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody talked.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking in the kitchen drawers.
Many people in Africa died as a consequence of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you call her?
Louder.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was suppressed.
We're playing with destiny.
I thought he had bigger titties.
I might be ready to go soon.
Tom can't feel it.
There's some more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The noise was annoying me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know things.
Was it all just a dream?
I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone laughed at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a priest.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is he like that, Tom?
I'm having a sinus problem.
I had low expectations from him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you.
Tom's out of water.
Esperanto doesn't belong to anyone.
She's skilled with a saw.
Turn it off.
I don't share my real name on any website.
Put aside the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I've got three kids.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
He's slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a trippop.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the ceiling.
Her face was covered with semen.
Tom is just.
This is what you need to do first.
We met around noon.
I don't feel like doing anything tonight.
Get him a drink.
Thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
That's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We're eating apples.
Is that moral?
Do you know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm so confused.
They waited outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, which is why they ordered him to leave the firm.
I would understand anything from you.
Tom aspires to become a teacher.
Have a nice week.
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?

Why are you blaming them?
They're too expensive.
We're being childish.
Tom was a barefoot.
Tom would have enjoyed this.
Tom's up there.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer, I don't remember what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what you just started.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.

This is much better.
I'm gonna get her to dig out your lawn.
Tom's good at math.
Tom pulled his money out of the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You have to sit down.
The harder the better.
You can rest.
I eat with the kids every week.
Tom's always been stubborn.
You make bread in your oven.
You're brutal.
Your sons are pretty hot.
I know how much that's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We had lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite the disease.
Tom tried to help me.
They went through the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think it's weird just because it's not a noose.
She decided not to pay the Globe.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
That's so horrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them apples.
I can't argue with that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for that.
It hasn't welded yet.
Quote me an example.
I should definitely get you a drink.
In case this happens again, give me a call.
Were you being honest?
The movie was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't budge.
They're close.
Mom and Dad aren't going with me.
The vampire lived in the dead coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I did my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be submitted?
Tom's got a bruise on his eye.
Tom's firm is compromised.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're angry.
When I came this morning, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, the mirror in the bathroom falls.
Tom painted it.
Tom thought Mary was gonna be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
I'm afraid I don't have enough money on me right now.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, what about you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
That's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
I got my pay back again.
I'll never even set foot in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom's got a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscope?
I can walk.
Contracting.
It was a disaster!
Tom's good at his profession.
I made it up.
I'd like to know why they wiped my name off the list.
Tom arranged all this.
I'm not gonna rat her out.
Flowers attract bees.
The water's too thin.
In the past, there was no plant life in this country.
You're incompetent.
What was Tom's answer?
You will do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you going out with?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did what I was supposed to do.
Tom's too far away.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, so?
I have a lot of interest in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I can't give him these.
I'm not used to it.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not showering.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Are you going to vote for him?
The famous critic and poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Are they going to arrest me?
Unfortunately, it breaks all the rules.
Why aren't you home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a certain Mr. Kimura on the line for you.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound was festering.
No, and it's not under the chair.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't help himself.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.

Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're strangers.
It's a moral choice for the translator to translate or not.
You're ugly.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to ask Tom for permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd get him some help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of nails.
I did it.
Look around.
Hand me the wrench.
Tom seems upset.
It was an ambush.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was just amazed at Tom's politeness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom's wearing glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because orbit is oval, the distance between planets and the sun keeps varies.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
Tom looked Mary deep in the eye and smiled.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
It's all good.
The stars are glowing.
Really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without turning my knees.
Tom's white.
Tom could do better.
That's not why I asked you here, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
Yeah, you did.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be notified in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20th, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't have to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to.
I've always wanted not to say too much.
You're wandering.
We're going shopping.
Tom knew Mary would like it, John.
Tom's a grouch.
I just cut my finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does he have to go, Tom?
Would I lie to you?
He has a passive character.
It's possible someone was onto her.
My wife was here once.
It's a powder medicine.
We were going down the coast.
I don't want you harassing them.
Depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's got a bad reaction.
Did Mike stop drinking liquor?
Tom was checking you out.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're so cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was her great pleasure to meet her granddaughter.
It's our best shot.
I smell flowers.
Tom's all growed up.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and started injecting.
She's good for tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak for yourself.
He's been a major pain in the ass.
She slowly developed hatred for me.
I don't think he's up for it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
So didn't we get along?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't help himself.
I'll never forget it.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I am.
My computer froze up.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so a conscience does make us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I expect nothing less than perfection.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked it out.
He couldn't get his pants off.
I don't need to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom wouldn't help me.
You were wrong.
Good to see you.
You're free to leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom paid a visit to Boston.
The screen releases green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened so fast.
Would you like proof?
When we awoke this morning, we faced terrible news.

Wipe your eyes.
Mary got scared.
None of your business!
Tom wouldn't throw anything away.
Tom's an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to be enjoying himself.
Maybe Tom will hear you.
Since when does Tom sleep?
It's our job to help them.
He suffered heavy losses.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What are you eating, by the way?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like some mint candy?
Why would he do that to us, Tom?
I don't even want to know.
They'll do it.
I'm gonna have to spend some time here.
I almost cut myself.
I'll come down here.
We're paranoid.
This isn't silver.
A blood vessel blew into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for your car?
Is that your mother?
Tom was not a man to get along with.
I don't like pork.
She likes to run.
I need a guinea pig.
This was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom read the note.
The kids painted pictures on the sidewalk with the chalk.
You're wondering what took you so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I should take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom got married when he was 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up at the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, and it's not even under the chair.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows something's up.
Tom is always trying to do what he thinks is right.
Tom apparently doesn't often understand what's going on.
Come visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the great moods that are in the house.
I'm not a local.
What's on your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's happening right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning a piano.
They need the money.
He's swimming well.
You're not gonna find us.
I heard from her.
You stay out of this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're following us.
Do you think you can stop me?
It's actually quite common.
I've decided to forgive them.
I know you know.
Did I do something to get mad at me, Tom?
The Triangles don't have four corners.
There's not enough light to read here.
Tom made it up with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary untied the lipstick.
Well, guess what.
Tom is ashamed of me.
Guess what he told me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've always asked.
I'll do the talking.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everybody's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon's coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
You found your parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as morning.
Mr. Gorbachev, take this wall down!
Tom seems stunned.
Tom got caught up in it.
That's what it's supposed to be.
Let's try to get along.
That's gonna be hard.
I don't feel good about retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to like Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are abandoned.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl wearing the scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's on his way.
I don't think Tom's gonna fight much.
What are you wearing?
I'll get him right away.
It's our secret.

What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The prince has inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control it.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's not an emergency.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I don't care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't like me very much.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom will be here.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school with a car.
Did you see it?
I'll have to think about this very carefully.
I'll get a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Are you writing the speakers?
It was a great show.
We should go find them.
Last time I was home Friday night was when I was 13.
Tom knows Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
That's who I'm doing it for.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
Just give me a hard time.
What's Tom up to now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom is irrevocably angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
Protect our peace!
Tom is well armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom said to stay here.
I'm unarmed.
Do you hate them that much?
We have to get him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I've got a glass of beer to fill my thirst.
Tom's here on time.
Today is boring television.
Oh, great!
Tom found a four-list stand.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She quit smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We got up to say hello to them.
Have you been smoking?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nothing.
We're not gonna find them.
The association was founded in 1990.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds completely valid.
It's awesome!
Water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please write that down.
Tom has arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see any customers complaining.
There, I like challenges.
He doesn't sit on a bench.
I should have done it yesterday.
We're very much alike with Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks flying from the hearth.
It's just made up.
Tom kept Mary quiet all night.
Tom wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.

Let's gather a soul.
I'm sure you'll pass the exam that's coming.
We're on our way to Boston.
Tom's a good father.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He was passionately kissing her in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three bucket of bug spray.
It was disgusting.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these drugs for my father.
Kids love cake.
He had a lot of restraint.
I can handle Tom.
Tom's pissed off.
This is from us.
On an emergency, which number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't touch him.
Who's in charge here?
He confessed he had to lie.
Mary picked up Tom's money.
Enough of this nonsense.
By the way, Mike, please tell me how to get to your place.
Tom always wanted a son.
Tom's got a big mouth.
That looks like tea.
Tom's got asthma.
Tom started bitching.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe that won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We'd like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom got out of work early.
We have everything.
I baked him his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the beginning.
How did you do that without our help?
Why didn't you say "bye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last one.
I haven't found them yet.
They're ignoring me.
Hold on to the fence.
These must be counterfeiting.
Beauty cannot be determined objectively but rather depends on personal aesthetic criteria.

Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom was screaming and waking up from a nightmare.
Tom has a weak vision.
The flash wasn't working, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right now.
Is it over?
Everyone wants a lasting peace.
We met the other day.
Where's Tom's stuff?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom untied his eyes.
The tribe wasn't too happy that a Peacekeeper was coming.
Open up.
Put an apron on.
You might be wrong.
I also baked a baked cake and a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It's been an honor.
I spoke to my advisors about what items to take.
I already wrote everything that was supposed to be written.
Don't worry about me.
We can rest.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe it was Tom who stole Mary's bike.
Is Dan aware of what he did?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom doesn't have any friends.
Who lives in the room beneath this one?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it, so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice man.
I never change my schedule in bed.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen it?
Tom wasn't sure of anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll give you a ride.
I set up Tom.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom can be very vengeful.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like that before.
You're very cheeky.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really slow today, or is it me?
Did you Google me?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.

That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We're models.
What do you want?
Tom's got himself a new job.
Tom's not coming back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility for him is a burden.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I'm fed up today.
Pop music is my favorite kind of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was amazing.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
You better be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
Both brothers are musicians.
Tom seems jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and attached another to that place.
Stop!
Do you like cheese?
I'll get her for you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means clear.
That was very sloppy of Tom.
It's flat.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got angry.
Let them cut you.
Sewing is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They'll be well paid.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom's peeking in.
At the same time, you're hard and easy, and you're nice and tall; I can't live with even without you.
Let's say for now you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I can't hear anything.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
Nobody complained about that.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That's what you've disappointed him.
Don't talk about us.
This is one of the most popular restaurants in town.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom's spineless.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
We missed you.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget it.
We have to find them first.
I'm taking out a bill.
Tom hit Mary in the head with a pan.
Tom's gonna kill you.
We'd better get some sleep.
I always confuse those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place.
I need a musical instrument.
This report is very shoddy.
You should be helping them.
Tom didn't even cry.
He wrote a book, and it's great.
Tom twisted the handle.
I hope this is good.
If they lied about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I'm seeing ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is lamented by stupidity and indifference.
They all kiss.
Tom didn't protest.
What are the websites supposed to do?
Vampires live forever.
They both laughed.
What's in your hand?
She's a young student.
They're compassionate.
I hate dumplings.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent all day polishing the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far?
They pay me to help you.
This jacket is too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could have it ready by 2: 30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston on a plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later this afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was going to work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is on his way.
I can't confirm that.
Don't leave me waiting!
Tom gave me the picture on the chimney.
The pigeons symbolise peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I'll do anything for the good of mankind.
Did you really stay home all night?
Enya's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm sleepy.
It is not scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Honestly, Tom wasn't trying hard enough.
It's from England.
Is there anyone who doesn't agree?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom's funny.
Avoid smoking too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing on a computer.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a human product.
We've been looking everywhere for them.
I love your website.
I'm gonna get you.
Press this button.
Tom can really fight.
What exactly is troubling her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom blew up his car.
You've got to get past the problems.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards bear eggs.
We'll do something.
I think Tom is cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We had a good time.
You look disoriented.
The bread is cooked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad.
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see the way things are.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move over to that table.
Hold on a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where's Tom headed?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, come outside.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2: 30?
I can't ask Tom for more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees came down.
Lions don't know colors.
That was not true.
The answer is screwed.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendship lasts longer than memory.
Watch this way.
I want my money back now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a really good time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't be trying to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we both lied.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the crash.
I can imagine you married to Tom.
Tom seems polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm shorter than you.
I'll quote you a passage of one of those letters.
Tom noticed he didn't have his wallet.
The woman was sitting between two men.
Why do cows survive?
I've got pus coming out of my right ear.
The boxes on cardboard are fragile.
My stomach hurts in meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he doesn't speak French.
These guys didn't get names.
Fair enough.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm hanging my calendar on the wall.
I really missed you.
I love you more than anyone's ever loved you.
We packed their bags.
What couldn't you sleep of last night?
They put a curse on us.
Did you get Tom's invitation?
Just turn around.
You can't deny it.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What's the story about?
Tom wrote Mary a letter and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Turtles live long.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom's sleeping pretty tight.
Are you helping him?
She looks drunk.
You can talk to him later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here in a car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's over for us.
I'm sure.
Can you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You've lost something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call her?
The question is, who will make that decision?
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thank you for seeing me.
Susan is actually your stepsister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I prefer the eggs from the subterfuge.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for lunatics.
Why would I help him?
Tom flashed his shoes.
We've lost our faith in mankind.
Tom's shaking hands with the manager.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how is that my fault?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom lent me some money.
Am I interrupting?
Put an end to violence; fight for peace.
Look at how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom gets it.
Well, just let me know.
Most plants died.
Hang on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna love that.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Can I buy you dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him to swim.
I should take a look.
Come on down, Dick, it's time for dinner.
I'm running.
You drove fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had a daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's lying to the boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come inside.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
Nobody's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Did you pay already?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom painted his face.
What good is it to you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
It burns me when he wears those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they're living on the floor below this one.
They trusted her.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to his wedding.
I tried to explain to him, but he wasn't digging.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are kind of mammals.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom makes fun of you.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
That narrows it down.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his kid.
I underline the word "Alice" to underscore it.
Third time's the charm.
We need to get out of here.
This is an airtight pastry popular in the Philippines.
Nobody said anything.
Let's aspire to the virtues and give up the jurors.
You're smart.
I'm against this project.
Weren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom was listening to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm too late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty harmless.
There are reports of writing.
I'm in pain here.
You're shaking Tom up.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with it.
I was just picking on you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep, then finish tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Sick people often call at the most unpleasant time.
This dog is staring at me like he's trying to eat me.
They were beasts dressed in human skin and they weren't real men at all.
The man's starving.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is passing, but the good memories stay.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What were you thinking, Tom?
It was really sweet.
Everyone dies eventually.
I know how to stay calm.
We love beauty.
I mean it all day long.
I suggest we concentrate on finding a way out of this cave.
They don't trust me.
Dan wrote Linda another check.
That's right, folks!
This building is a monster building.
Tom wasn't disappointed.
Can you write?
I think you did it on purpose.
I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I love it!
Is this correct in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She has ears like sails.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn't really know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger ale.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only 18 years old.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like the sound of that.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I don't understand.
Tom's harmless.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you read my report.
Tom's out.
Don't keep repeating yourself.
The cherries are wormy.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look so good.
You've made him hurt, Tom.
Keep it warm.
Tom looked like he was nurturing.
What else can Tom do, Tom?
I want to become both physically and mentally strong.
She's a vivacious girl.
If I could stay, I would have stayed.
Please stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.
Tom sounded upset.
They're starting to go.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Don't even think about it.

I fell in love with you the first day I met you.
You always leave your bike dirty.
She moved here from Mexico five years ago.
Do you have any professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.
Let's have lunch.
I guess I've been a fool to expect you to do something.
You're my pride and joy.
What were you gonna say?
Make two lines.
The conditions should attract readers' attention.
He was sitting right in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
That worked.
I saw a French movie with English subtitles.
Tom was making fun of Mary.
Tom is full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mom says the kid's illness is fake.
Dan had a rough relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at a wedding.
Which one would you choose, Tom?
The hospital over there isn't that big.
Most people have to work to support themselves.
Nothing ever changes.

We're staying.

A lot of people do this.

He likes strange animals, like snakes.
We need leaders.

It's for them.
They're Tom's dogs.
Where's the vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to leave again.
How is it out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk me out of it.
I want to do a socially beneficial job to atone for all I've done.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I don't have any complaints.
I still don't understand women.

Tom is wonderful.
This sentence can be interpreted in many different ways, which I should have taken into account when translating.

I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.

Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom is a worthless egg.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not gonna pick the figs.
Don't you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since 9: 00.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
I'm having a terrible pain here.
I hate this rug.
I'm a little sick.
Tom got interrupted.
Tom couldn't remember where he left the umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'm gonna get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That thing's done.
It's unnatural.
What did you steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom is a gentleman.
Do you have any pets?
You were wrong about the painting.
I'll get it.

They asked for their pay to go up.
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't eaten already, I'd love to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he'd never see Mary again.
Drop your weapon.
How about we see each other tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought them those books.
It's quite possible.
I still don't know how to do that.
It's like greased.
It was a wonderful experience.
Tom hated them.
I want you to let Tom live.
He's playing.
Tom asked me if I liked his plan or not.
The fan's down.
It's not my fault.
I could do nothing.

Can I put this here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll drive you home.
Tom died of cancer.
How do you think it went?

We've been fooled.
Tom's right.
Tom looks scared.
The police will investigate the case.
You just disfigured him.
She's white.
Have a seat.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
I was wondering if you could help me out tomorrow afternoon.
Tom got violent.
When does the show start?
Can I just talk to you?
We're not gonna let you die.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Tom never said anything about it.
It's probably true.
We had to walk home in the rain.
I feel good being alone.
Tom has a lot of money, but he doesn't have any friends.
Every color has its meaning.

I'm out of breath.
Can you catch those?
My dog really likes oranges.
Your shelf is full of books.
Tom didn't sleep well.
I screwed up.
He brushed me.
The answer is confirmed.
We knew you'd come.
I live in town.
Let's go wake up Tom.
How am I gonna find him?
Ice melted.
I spit blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm scared of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to get him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
You must be so relieved.
They never caught me.
I love my country.

I'm pretty proud of that.
Make sure you don't count.
We live by the sea.
The soldiers carried steel helmets.
I'll send Tom home.
What are you guys talking about?
I'm guessing you didn't get my message.
Tom just assumed Mary caught a fish.
It's so annoying to sit at home.
It's not that bad.
They're stalling.
Did you ask Tom why he was late?
It's probably not worth waiting for.
I have to buy a new match for the room.
Tell Tom to write me.
Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.
It's sunny today, but it's cold.
What exactly is this about?
I'm not an expert.
My greatest ambition is to become an opera singer.
Help us as much as you can.
Tom ran down there.
Tom gave his word.
Tom and Mary were on our way from day one.
Let's make out.
Girls run and play.
I'm not sure Tom did this.
"Aren't you gonna eat the spinach?" "I'm gonna eat it after."
This is my favorite object.
Tom took off the weight.
You're driving me crazy.
I'll find Tom for you.
Come and talk to me, Tom.
My new boots are of real skin and have relatively high heels.
What did you expect me to say?
I feel safe when you're with me.

We're playing Sunday.
Tom got surrounded.
You're only allowed to stay if you're quiet.
I want to find out what happens next!
I can't believe Tom just did that.

I didn't want you to hate me.
Haven't I told you everything already?
Don't fight it.
I'm expecting your help.
Tom's going on his own.

That was very nice.

I hear you didn't like Tom.
I'm glad you're safe.
How long have you been working for them?
I need to help Tom.
Maybe Tom knows French.
Tom cut me.
When was the last time you had to do this?
When you spill wine, it's appropriate to wipe it with an elbow, isn't it?

The glove has a hole in his thumb.
Tom always got what he wanted.
That's what I suspected.
Tom doesn't do what he's supposed to do.
Dan was still alive.
The universe is not your friend or your soul.

What's she cooking for dinner?
What did you do?
Take care of Tom.
There's fruit and meat in the marker.
When she started talking, her voice was less dry than before.
Tom won't spend the rest of his life in prison.
Tom looked the other way.
Tom is the only one who can make Mary smile.
Can't you save the price a little bit?
First I'm gonna get out of my hair.
Tom's thirty years old now.
I didn't ask her to go there.
I hate him.
She became a great grandmother just days before she turned 9.
Have you looked everywhere?
It's important to learn that no one is ever 100%.
He gestures as he speaks.
Sit next to me.
Tom's thrilled.

I was getting a nap.
What a collection!
Everyone has names.
Have you ever smoked a dick?
The dog followed me.
That was Tom's last words.
I think Tom's gone.
He aspires to become an actress.
My plastic bottle broke.
Is this our cabin?
Let's do this.
We're sophisticated.

I can give her a message.
She's a little blushing.
Tom is a patient man.
Tom had too much to drink.
I have a few questions for them.
Tell Tom I don't know Mary.
We need to help her.
Tom stood there and kept his mouth shut.
I'm collecting stamps.
This time tomorrow we'll be in Boston.
Is this where you live?
This room looks like a bone.
I'm not talking about him.
Tom shoelaces.
We don't have to go.
I'm talking to Tom.
You asked me to help.
Tom will tell you when he wants to.
I don't want to talk about her.
Tom wanted Mary to go away and leave him alone.
I already know that.
Is that a rhetorical question?
Tom is one of the victims' brothers.
The lines are mild.
It doesn't matter.
I like comic books.
You have really good handwriting.
The wind just kept blowing.
Meanwhile, the foolish uncle was sitting in the living room.
Was I talking to you?

Do you have a band?
You're free to wait here.
I got an "A" in French.
I want the class to be quiet.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.

I don't want to involve Tom in this.
It's no big deal.
Tom laughed at everything.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are you still dancing?
Listen carefully, you need to know this.
Are you gonna dress up this year?
I'll do what you want.
I don't feel that hot either.
Do you want to talk to me?
If there is an unforgivable act, it is an act to refuse to forgive.

How did he react to the news?
Where did Tom say he went?
Tom betrayed Mary.
I live for him.
He's on his way home.
I'm not even sure I remember that correctly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
Stop sucking me up.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice man.
Eagle is the bird king.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you take a break?
You never asked why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let me talk to you.
I think Tom's nice.
The sky is divorcing.
The noise will wake the baby.
Look straight ahead.
That's not really something a man should be preparing for.
Tom and Mary are playing craps.
I made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom signed on to Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think he'd prefer blue.
How did you get here?
You picked up the book.
Don't touch my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do it.
Tom read Mary's secret journal.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked for two hours.
He's the one I found out about you.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
From a long walk, he got his appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom used a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
I just can't get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it was done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both laughed again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom felt strong.
The meeting's already started.
We want to hear it.
I really like the way your hair looks.
Cold out there?
You should go to bed early.
Tom's a danger.
He's addicted to pornography.
That's just stupid.
Tom's an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair's a mess.
Tom is the top boy in the class.
Tom, you've grown up fast.
It was our only comfort.
Nobody would care.
Have you written in a journal today?
I just want this never to happen again.
Can I do this alone?
Is this your radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of jail.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to peek through the keyhole, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I knew the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that now.
Why are you blaming it?
Come on, Tom.
I'll make sure I get there on time.
Nobody came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause disease.
We're up and down.
Tom has a sharp hearing.
I bribed them.
I told you I can't do it.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not.
Tom stole your money.
Don't take the cork out.
I helped him undo the table.
I had a potato steak last night.
It's better for your health to take the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We sedated them.
Your faith is nasty.
I'm sorry I even told them something.
I wouldn't be asking you if I could find someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom's begging.
I slept in the fireplace.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That could work.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom's the best.
He has an eye for art.
That was the worst party I've ever been to in my life.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any April Japanese movies?
Did you get them?
French first was slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We gave them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her guilt.
Can I wait here?
We can look in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need instructions.
It was ironic.
I baked you some cookies.
It can be done.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
Maybe you should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many reading books is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
He saved the bell.
He's got my head kicked.
You have to be careful.
Tom seems very contained.
The fun continues your youth.
You're free to go.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
What do you mean you don't know?
It was a surprise.
Do you really think you can make it here by 2: 30?
I'll be in my lab.
This meat smells bad.
Like I should know you?
Tom was very good at hiding all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
I have no idea.
She's running slow.
How can you be so sure?
The picture shows bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in squalor.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it was time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just ripped Tom's room apart last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I would have sold this dog if it were higher.
I'm gonna go help my friends.
Turns out there wasn't an order from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son likes rockets a lot.
You need to hurry.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a bum.
We despise her.
He came before them.
Here you go, bro, half off.
Tom took a shit at the table, this new fly that he just bought.
Tom's gonna help Mary.
Dan grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's pissed off.
The landscape is too close.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under your bed.
I can't go in there.
We need to test it.
The expression freedom was strictly limited.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom was celebrating his victory with wine.
We don't have a week.
I'm gonna try and get some training.
Esenta's here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the accident?
Water only takes three minutes to boil.
I could get fired for this.
What's the point?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so magnificent.
Dan was involved with Linda for a very short time.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
I'd like to get into a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights, they are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat one another in the spirit of common humanity.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a lightning bolt.
They kissed.
I got a buddy.
Tom likes to do everything on his own.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
This soup is oversalted.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom kept practicing.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom's looking into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend?
It seems familiar.
I envy her.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
He's got his limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
The bookshop, the sage, the rosemane, the timian and the oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're a despicable man.
Everything looked fine.
Leave this here.
He sat down on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew you couldn't trust Tom.
I can keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
Well, I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practicing.
She may have fooled you, but she won't fool me!
Let's just get out of here.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
I don't give a fuck.
Tom held his hand in the bag and pulled a few coins.
The room was a coupon.
It's simple to solve this task.
They must have removed the bullet that was stuck next to his spine.
It's so fun.
Does Tom seem upset?
If you don't mind, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm very sorry, but I seem to have lost your sunscreen.
I don't have a sword.
Suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how it hurts to sting you.
We're delivering grain from the United States of America.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink, et cetera.
I don't know how he did it, Tom, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom's busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the living room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it doesn't seem right to ask Tom.
My brother will be here first thing in the morning.
You don't have to like everything.
Are those potato chips?
They'll get it soon enough.
We've made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the ponytail.
I broke a vase today.
That's what I care about.
I'm gonna go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I like to make him face-to-face.
I was waiting outside for her.
You're inflamed.
You need to grow up and grow up a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I got lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
How about your name and phone number?
Tom used to throw a rock at me.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so mad, Tom?
Tom's gonna be here for a couple of days.
I hope we're the last.
They stood on the arrow outside the store to avoid the rain.
I've got a couple of reasons coming into my head.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't know Mary had cancer at all.
It was my fault.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't really understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They're all underwater.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there was a movie called "The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming!"
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was missing school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Thank you.
Let's just say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom's not fit to write his name yet?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many more days till Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I'm not good at it.
Tom has a bug collection.
She made tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
Do you have enough?
The mice are plague transmitters.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom snuck out.
I start tomorrow.
I haven't been honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not anticipate the monarchy's fall.
Tom gives me the creeps.
I like roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He went to sleep while driving, so he caused a car accident.
They've hugged us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove it.
It was just beautiful.
Tom says hello to Mary by waving.
That's okay.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How do you use the camera?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Don't overdo it.
Tom's an accountant.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need any help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't understand English, not German.
It'll take us nearly three hours to get off this mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Are you done packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's on the mend.
Why would I do that, Tom?
Who are you there with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm bound to trust you.
You worry too much about him.
The president announced that the United States is launching a satellite into orbit.
I can't lend you this book.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
I want to be cuter.
Tom helped me a little.
Did I come too soon?
Sounds pretty cool.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Watch it, Tom.
Tom tied his shoelaces.
I can't turn it off.
We shouldn't have stayed up till 2: 30.
You're really good.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not rational.
Women in America didn't have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did you give him the dog?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Tom's deciding somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm rang.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Any objections?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's a pointless fact.
Is it delicious?
Look out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a kind man.
Tom's getting a little rusty.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer black.
Tom has given himself to his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogotá, and Osaka is similar to Medellín.
Did you stop beating on your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop, Tom?
I said I'll get him.
They're kind of mammals.
I'll get started.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I cook soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his abs.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where does the ox go?
She shaved her wet hair with a towel.
If an adult lies with a child, he thinks he's always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck!
It's possible I'm not graduating.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of that.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated his room walls with racist symbols.
Tom was waving his hands.
Open your notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the cover.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do anything.
Tom's moved on to the next question.
That was thoughtful.
I want a life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't like riddles.
This book will help you write forever.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay till Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please drive the room.
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he already saw Mary this morning.
I'm getting my honey toast first thing in the morning.
They tasted bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I guess the parrot ran away from the cage.
We went to pick strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get it back.
Tom threw his girlfriend out.
Just give it to Tom.
Nobody's thrilled.
I almost didn't come.
I was making a cake.
Look at the number.
I was thrilled with your design.
You told me to call anytime.
What's that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn everything off.
Tom choked.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
I had a bladder infection last month.
Look at the girls.
I'm gonna take off the weight.
That's exactly what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I appreciate foreign languages!
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What's the use of that?
I'm right with the one I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
You can sit down now.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thanks!"
Mary was a lovely bride.
Tom should be ashamed of himself.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a chatterbox.
The lock is broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were very confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good stories.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom's no good at sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom felt he needed to redeem himself.
This message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm no match for you.
The firm fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
Internet is a serious thing.
Mars is the red planet.
You beat the dog with a rock.
Tom kept staring.
It's 7: 00 already.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Like you wrote this book yourself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not get cocky.
Look around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with his dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
To prepare the soil for planting, you have to isolate it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmoud can't stand to lose.
No one listens to you.
Okay, you convinced me.
I'm ready for him now.
It can't be!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgotten and hate usually come in pairs.
Tom didn't know it happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants broke.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly in.
I said yes.
Tom admitted he spilled the red wine.
Do you want a puppy?
I live near a dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the Loire castles.
Tom is a hopeless case.
He's a little ahead.
I think about him every day.
I'm going to help find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
It would be my pleasure to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
You got all your stuff right here.
Stay as long as you want.
Grab my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into it.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very dashing in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did it?
They're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a little while.
How many bellies do I have in a day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned around to leave.
Tom's kind.
How was the party last night?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate doing this.
Dan changed into a begger.
You have very perky eyes.
Doesn't that count?
He seemed tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom into town.
We should let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Have a smoke, then go inside.
Don't let them go.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems informed.
Would you like a drink of water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, quantity is not true.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
The quadrants have four corners each.
I kept working.
They've developed an addiction.
Would you like me to go with you?
I'll meet you there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and kept quiet.
Bring a shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary took a dump on her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one listened to Tom.
Do you want me to pick something up at the supermarket?
The mass is over.
Tom erased the blade of the knife from his jeans.
Tom was struggling to stay focused.
Tom's got a long beard.
One of them spoke to me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your gums bleeding?
Just let her call me, okay?
Tom put his beer wings on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
He gave me a seductive view.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far did you go?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I should stop by later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Are you coming down?
Give him a dollar.
Did he have an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how that's possible.
He looked sharp at me through his glasses.
Linda had Dan convinced that he was stalking her.
Why would they mind that?
Let's not bother Tom.
A rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do it.
There's yours.
We didn't mean for that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave.
We need to be free.
Why is the sky blue?
Where's Tom's keys?
Did Tom hurt himself?
Who can break the tank?
I was sick of it.
Tell me what I'm doing here.
Tom has fought depression in multiple periods of his life.
Shall I take your bags?
I would trust my life.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What's there to worry about?
I need a snack.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
Class up.
He had penguin feet on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called in a tow truck.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It's obvious to all of us that he's in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move over.
I'm not talking fast.
I need to talk to you face to face.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep in there.
I live in a town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the test results?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was on a rampage.
She's studying English.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a renowned writer or a lunatic.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her up.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna survive this.
We're here to apologize.
We will visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit his chewing gum.
May it be my way.
I got them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How did you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy to get bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
Probably won't pay the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how she was born interested in archaeology.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What should we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president seemed strong.
Buy what?
Tom went to the window and looked outside.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad.
I'll be in Boston this week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people get scared enough, anything can happen.
You're a tough town.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Seize the day.
What's Tom ringing?
He's very handsome.
Make sure the buyer keeps an eye on it.
Tom gets away from class a lot.
Now it's time for compensation.
Most virgins have read hymen.
You can handle it.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor they call me a saint when I ask why the poor don't have food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus was held up, we waited a long time in the rain.
You'll figure it out.
Does that dog have a dog?
She's resting on me.
Mary was wearing fake eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he spoke more French than he really said.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture, the orator should have spoken slower.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes soaked.
That drug has calmed the patient down.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the work offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look foolish.
His mother's American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom funny?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The Sphinx began to circulate around him.
We need your help finding her.
It means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Boucheersky did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom seemed pissed off.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's my call, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It works well.
Tom got sick badly.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Should we wait here for him?
Enjoy the day.
Tom just got dumped.
I prefer goat cheese from the cow.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't had dairy in a while.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Everybody having fun?
I was up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know you have it.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
Bars cut wood.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Shit all the way down.
The single couples should not be able to get married.
The cow forgot she was ever a calf.
Give them this picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Spreading is a hand thing.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm so confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister tear the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put out your cigarette?
What were they laughing at?

Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled.
May I see your report?
That's not very wise.
Are you going?
I'm happy these days.

Tom wouldn't have made it without Mary's help.
And that's where Tom is, then?
Dan spent the last night drinking in a meat inn.
I'm in.
Do you need a rent?

They're coming again.
You're really sweet.

What's stopping you?
Tom's got thin lips.
Kids blow bubbles.
Tom trains violin at least half an hour every day.

I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to dip in suncream.
Did you have a hard time?
Tom's voice was barely listening.
Don't make a sound.
I've decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When is this going to happen?
We'll have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just sleep it off.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is just love in search of words.
Sitting around all day is unhealthy.
Tom will wait.
I suggest you bend over.
The real story is a little different than what you said.
It was your fault.
The balloon was coming down slowly.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never acted like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom started laughing.
Is that why you came?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures for me have no meaning.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to anyway.
It worked.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you happy to see me?

Let me get my shit together.
She's selling marine schools.
Take care of the prisoner.
We all like you.
The kid cried and cried for hours.
I'm gonna go ask them.
Tom's nothing like his brother.
Tom was stubborn.
That was brilliant.
Please tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn't possibly do it himself.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Allow me to introduce Mr. Tanaka.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the pie into eight pieces.
You might be needed.

Doesn't look much different.
He's getting over it.

You better let me do it.
This house is better than that other house.
I'm sure Tom did.
Let me see it.
What's in it?
Did you see anything?
I'm almost there.
Marry me.
Tom's not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and night shines.
No one's getting fired.
There's no one else.
When I was on my way to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.
He pulled the rope.
I can't feel my legs.
How can you say that?
Tom, get the hell out of here.
They blindfolded me.
Do we really want to help them?
Whoever pays the bills has the right to be masters.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, bring me some mush.
When are you going to come and see us?
There are tragedies every day.
We didn't bring you anything.
I'm hearin 'it.
Give me those papers.
You can have mine.
Tom's not gonna like that.
All comments are redundant.
Did you do this for me?
Can you get them some help?

That smells like cheese.

Patient suffers from hallucinations.
Why is it so important that we be there today?
Virtue without gold is better than gold without honor.
I didn't want milk.
Tom seems offended.
We know him.
I've been there for hours napping.

I'm naked.
We need heroes.
No one can help you.
Do you think Tom likes his job?
It's noisy here.
What can be done?
I assume you found him.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.
I'm going, and I'm going, and I'm going.
Are you saying you don't want Tom to come to your party?
I'll let you know what's going on.
Whose house is this?
Tom would have failed without Mary's help.
Tom is cooperating.
Snow's a deep one rate.
She went with him to Boston.
Tom's been pretty busy lately.
How do I find Tom?
I didn't hurt them at all.
The baby's banging the rattlesnake.
I'm gonna go look for Tom now.
I'm just glad I can help.
Why would that scare you?
This will do for now.
They need to talk.
That's not exactly what happened.
It's not like you were wrong.
Tom listened right away.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
There is no life without the tegos.
You've got me all wrong.
I couldn't help Tom to do that.
Don't call me a jerk.
You're very attracted to me.
What's for dinner?
Open up on page nine.
Tom unzipped his jacket.
Tom was beaten.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
What can we do for her?
I really like this wine.
He doesn't like fish meat.
We had a fight.
Did Tom grapes eat?
Put the gun down.
Here's your pudding.
Don't curse or I'll wash your mouth with soap.
If I were you, I'd follow him to the end of the world.
I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to get them a gift.
I'm not quite happy with Tom's explanation.
I guess you're right.
He ran away so he wouldn't get caught.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom's not back yet.
It's got sentimental value.
I asked her to dance with me.
Tom doesn't know anyone here.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?
We need to set a trap.
Tom's parked, he'll be right there.
Love me a little, love me long.
Tom's in the living room watching cartoons with the kids.
There's no answer for everything.
Tom was afraid to tell his people about what happened.
He was in mud to his knees.
You told Tom about that, right?
Tom's calling Mary.
Tom's not generous.
You can't prove anything.
Tom hates green peppers.
Aren't you panicking?
We should do this again sometime.
I think Tom is resourceful.
He's an honest man.
Those pajamas are too big.
We'll turn around.
Is there anyone else?
It's not all people are equal, it's still good news, because it means they're not all bad people.
Isn't it exciting?
Tom's here to get help.
It's easy for me to talk to them.
Tell me where to find him.
The purpose of the Punctuation signs is to help the reader.
I'd be happy to do that.
Will you come to Boston with us next year?
Why are you hesitating?
We already know the truth.
That's what Tom says.
Tom was trying to figure out where you put your passport.
That's really great.
Tom wondered if Mary had already woken up.
Do you want us to take you home?
That house was built out of bricks.
We didn't come to any conclusions.
Tom came by around 2: 30.
Doesn't sound like much.
Tom tried to escape.
I'm scared of cats.
The crowd was clapping.
I leave the clubs to grow on the edges.
I think Tom's evil.
The door was locked.
I'm gonna get your daughter.
I'm gonna call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We got separated.
I was too tired to go on.
It all has its sound.
What does the doctor think is wrong?
Tom will forgive you.
Tom wasn't kidding.
It's written on his forehead.
Last night I got a call from a man named Tom Jackson.
Can you use this page like Twitter?
It shouldn't be too hard to complete the report by 2: 30.
Tom's been doing it for a while.
So, heteronormality is in close terms of sexism.
She has a notepad.
Are these your bags?
What reason do you learn English?
Has Tom left yet?
Tom must have been a big deal.
Tom's still home.
This film is worth watching.
My chest is growing.
I'll talk by tomorrow if I get to explain everything to you.
Dan's back in London.
My dad bought me a digital wristwatch for my birthday.
You know me too well.
Tom is a man-eater.
Don't you feel lonely?
Did you make coffee?
Don't take too much for it.
Stand up when you talk to me.
He's always cheerful.
The forest was very calm.
I have to go back for them.
I don't want to go shopping today.
Tom is intrusive.
Most of the European-made clothing is produced outside Europe.
Tom's still busy.
Why do I have to fight?
We can look online.
When I was younger, I used to always travel by car.
I couldn't determine exactly what the problem was.
Maybe Tom will object.
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
I bought my pair of shoes.
You're so negative.
We haven't found Tom yet.
I need the internet.
My wallet's in my pocket.
We have something to show you.
Can we wait here for them?
When I pee, something like pus comes out.
You beat her.
The stars showed up.
Where's our money?
The Internet is not your personal army.
I play volleyball a lot.
Where's that shirt I bought you?
That'll teach them the order.
I have to sit down, my soul is in my nose.
Why do you like it?
I wish I had enough money to buy a house like that.
Tom's done.
We're ready to fight.
I suggest you listen to your doctor.
I don't understand why everybody thinks this book is so good.
Tom got hired.
The time has passed especially quickly.
There's no way out.
The heavy rain of the night made it difficult to save survivors from the crashed ferry.
My wife is hiding something from me.
What can we offer our guests?
Tom's pissed.
Look at the number.
There must be a key.
He cut the apple in half.
All balls are yellow.
I have a white cat.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
Get on the couch.
Did they hit anyone?
The factory produces toys.
Tom didn't mean that.
Let them help us.
I'm very busy here.
What were you singing?
I can figure it out myself.
The room has a view of the ocean.
I don't need a ride.
Don't eat like cattle.
There was water all over the kitchen floor.
Cancer is a great enemy of humanity.
It's still for sale.
It wasn't easy solving this problem.
Every once in a while, I was gonna get a carriage away from me.
Tom put the gun down.
There's no way in theory that I can get this job done in one day.
You almost froze with horror.
Suddenly I felt old.
They annoy me.
He was asleep.
I'm ready.
You killed him to avenge your deceased father.
Tom got a cookie.
I've been studying French since I was 13.
Men don't really differ that much from women.
Eugenia shared with us her favorite facial purification oils and skin cultivation.
I'm fed up with French.
I don't care if 20 girls do.
The bull's mouth.
Tom's walking.
Will you be open tonight?
They don't understand.
Born in 1960.
Can I have one?
Bubbles are usually mild.
I'm shaken.
It might be raining today.
We were ready.
Let's take a trip to Boston.
Here's my membership card.
Someone told me that.
You're beautiful.
Wash up.
Tom refused to leave.
Do you have a minute?
I need to know what you're doing to find Tom.
Tom didn't try to argue.
Can I eat something?
They died and left me alone.
Tell Tom it's urgent.
I'm not gonna bother you.
Stay here and watch her.
Wouldn't you start cracking hair on that?
How are you gonna escape?
Let's start with this wine.
My leg is broken.
How are you going to make that happen?
I took Tom to lunch.
We're Tom's parents.
Did you play tennis?
I'd like to see the house you used to live in.
Don't you love your wife?
You're the only one who's ever met Tom.
Where's your wallet?
Do you like English?
That's exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these earrings from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I was wondering who that was.
I think he's right.
What are you doing here?
That's the wrong thing to do.
She's in great condition.
I grabbed Tom for the elbow.
Mary likes fashion and makeup.
I haven't heard from them.
I have to help them.
Is it far from here?
I can't die here.
Tom listened.
I think I was wrong.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
She bought a newspaper.
That can't be right.
You look imaginary.
Didn't I warn you about her?
Let's start with Tom.
You haven't slept all night, have you?
It's going down.
The noise will wake the baby.
I'm late for spinach.
Do you know what happened?
Stop talking about me.
Tom was sitting on the sofa with Mary watching TV.
Nothing bothers us.
I think I should have asked for help.
Tom's wearing a stethoscope.
Good to see you, Tom.
How are your folks?
I don't usually have work on Monday.
I'm a fool for trusting them.
Tom might need a little help.
They went to worship every day.
Tom was a teacher.
It would have been broken.
There's a crowd at the bar.
You're letting the idea go.
Tom wondered more and more.
Who gave them that kind of money?
We have to get them a present.
When did the war end?
Did the dishwasher work?
Tom's a married man.
Like Tom said, this soup is oversalty.
Did I miss so much?
Why didn't you stop?
Will you come outside?
They stopped to talk.
Did you bring a dryer?
What Tom did was a mistake.
That's huge.
I know who you're protecting.
Just do what you want.
Can I use that?
We could talk about Tom.
What is this about?
You'll have to study harder next year.
There are islands in the sea.
There are seaweed in the sea.
I'm glad I didn't have to do that.
Nobody likes Tom.
Why are we stopping?
Wow!
I should have asked them first.
Tom might be a little fat.
I'd rather die than fulfill your request.
Maybe you should just fire him.
Where was he born?
Tom's caught two places.
I'll send you the prescription.
It would look good.
I'll get the guns.
Choose what you like the most.
Your crimes have desecrated the graves of your ancestors.
Don't be discouraged now.
It looks like her style.
I've had enough of fighting.
He's not like us.
What do you think Tom did?
I'm a journalist.
Sarah has 31 pen.
This is very confusing.
I bring terrible news.
If possible, I'd like to experience one more bitter love like in middle school.
I saw Tom in the area.
Surprised.
I'm from Rome.
Tom's got a kink in his mouth.
It's a stupid rule.
Is that what Tom suggested?
Did you ask Tom who helped him with his homework?
Tom doesn't know what it's like to be poor.
Tom thinks Mary should be happy.
We're all eager to watch the movie.
I'll be in Skopje tomorrow.
We're done talking.
I'm training.
Cat's in the bag.
I started thinking about him.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
He can't concentrate on his academic work.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
They became addicted.
All I want is money.
I don't say dangerous things about their children.
I want to know why you and Tom don't get along.
I've recovered completely.
I was the only one who knew where Tom went.
How hard was Tom hurt?
Was he compassionate?
The book you gave me is very interesting.
It's an honor.
Every time something unusual happens, they blame me.
Tom refuses to work.
What could that mean?
I'm sick of being called a liar.
Prospector can't beat it.
Does he have sugar?
Dan and Linda finally moved to London.
She suddenly fainted.
It looked funny.
Tom plays in a band.
We live together now.
You've been busy.
I'm sorry, isn't it a mistake?
I didn't say anything.
The ship's changed course.
Tom was sent to a psychiatric hospital.
I feel insecure.
It's a safe place.
Tom didn't move his lips.
I'm an alcoholic.
Why is that crazy?
Tom sold his house in Boston.
I have no intention of explaining anything.
April Fools!
Tom used to say that.
I told Tom the truth.
Tom taught me.
How do you think Tom died?
I decided to stay where I am.
I think you're gonna have to work your ass off.
Open up, sesame!
Tom looked outside.
Tom enjoys playing tennis.
I don't need a car.
Most people are right-handed.
Should I paint with or without a flash?
He and his sisters were eating ice cream while the radio was on.
Give them a chance.
Let's help her.
Tom's in Australia.
I think I can solve this problem on my own.
They're too busy fighting each other to think of common ideals.
Can you give them a minute?
Tom's an adult now.
We don't sell alcoholic beverages and cigarettes to minors.
I'm back on the bus.
This is how we do it.
Tom doesn't act like a typical college teacher.
Tom and I were wondering if you'd like to join us.
Maybe it was a cat.
The fight does not seem to be coming to an end.
Mary plays the piano.
Tom's upset.
I forgot to tell Tom who's picking him up at the airport.
I'll never work for them.
Tom's not kidding.
Did you drink something?
Let's do it now and that's it.
Let me talk to Tom.
Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You were in a car accident, but you're gonna be okay.
Think whatever you want.
Where I can find a hospital.
Don't ruin our fun.
I can make that happen.
I'm not discriminating.
I'll go if Tom goes.
We'll be back in a month.
It's more recommended to check for any adverse effects if you're drinking when you're drinking the medicine they prescribed.
Look, Tom, I'm sorry I bargained in.
I want to swim.
It was from her.
We can talk to Tom.
I assumed it was free.
You're gonna need some help.
Do I need a lawyer?
We gotta get to work.
I went on a trip to Boston.
Tom started climbing.
Tom likes you a lot.
Tom nodded at Mary.
Now it's the first time I've put pepper on my balls.
I'll manage.
The drug worked.
Tom can play guitar.
Who broke it?
The line is short.
I've had enough of Tom.
I like you so much.
I want to take you somewhere I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, that's not what I meant!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't remember buying this.
He saved a sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier this morning.
Get up already, sloth!
How long ago was it?
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I want to marry her.
Tom has another plan.
This couch is very comfortable.
If I were you, I'd be avoiding Tom for a while.
I'm not waiting to find out.
Let's continue this discussion outside.
You can easily recognize Tom because he's very tall.
The doctor examined Tom to determine that there were no internal injuries.
I feel like I let you down.
You're always tired.
Who's gonna hurt you?
I'm stuck.
You're with Tom, right?
This orange is really delicious.
I kind of like it.
I love golf.
Nobody likes us very much.
It's very rare.
I'm not good at this.
Tom spilled a mint.
You won't find them.
Tom doesn't write to me anymore.
Tom was very busy.
All set.
She's indisposed.
It's all in the file.
Let's not mess it up.
Get it all out.
Have you already made up your mind?
Tom's eavesdropping.
Can anybody hear me?
How are you holding up?
Tom didn't know this.
I want to fuck her.
I can come by tomorrow.
When did you get up?
I have a crush on you.
Tom's in his bedroom talking on the phone.
We had a hard time.
Sharpen your pencil.
I'm guilty.
The dog should be on a leash.
I'd much rather go alone.
It was them.
I want to lie down and get some rest.
Tom's in the hospital, recovering what he overdosed on.
He cracked the nuts with his teeth.
I can't believe we cooked ourselves to shoot Tom.
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
She didn't hit him, she hit me.
I'll be busy tomorrow.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
Just give it your best shot.
Tom's a face.
When you go on a date with a girl, you gotta be confident.
Tom, please, this isn't the right time or the right place.
We put her under surveillance.
Tom is unreliable.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
That's good training.
This chair is all by itself.
I should have said no.
I had to consider what might have happened.
That was my tactics.
I've lived here for many years.
Are you still in bed?
It was for her.
I have to buy flowers for my own life.
I know you've done your best.
Tom wasn't supposed to write his password on the inside of the cover of the notebook.
When did you move to Boston?
I just need to find them.
I know them both.
I should feel sorry for them.
I don't bargain.
Is there a problem?
Knock on the door.
We were so worried.
I don't comment on their articles.
You'll be my guest.
Watching TV is fun.
What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is really cool.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.
It's just words.
There was a short silence.
Tom closed the trunk.
We met last year in Boston.
Tom is such a bitch.
Nobody walks in Los Angeles.
I'm not a whore.
He was in a hurry to catch the bus.
I didn't mind.
Look what Tom got.
I don't want to cook.
Tom was adorable.
I agree with this plan.
Justice is expressed through deeds.
I don't know if you know it or not, but here in America you're expected to tip the waiter.
That kind of behavior was childish on his part.
I'm walking with her.
That would be fine.
Sorry about yesterday.
Go away while you still can.
Tom was a little uncomfortable around Mary.
I don't need those.
Did Tom give you that?
Cars replaced the chariots.
I was kidnapped.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
This tea is delicious.
We're on the same footing.
Tom was surprised and a little confused.
Tom is very hard on himself.
She's a nerd.
The lemonade is cold.
The lamp was swinging back and forth.
Tom looks insecure.
There's nothing else to look for.
Tom is a materialist.
He can't do that.
Why should I care about them?
I called him from the hospital.
I opened my umbrella.
Tom has no manners.
Pray for her.
Can you hold on a second?
It's not over yet.
Look, she's being chased in the square.
Didn't anyone ever tell you you didn't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell out of the tree.
Tom told Maria he'd never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm on my way.
I was in half a dream.
Don't expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the sweet stuff and the books.
This is much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna freak out.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I got stung.
Don't you ever answer anything?
I was staring at the man.
Watch Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work for them.
All my dreams will come true.
The river runs through the valley.
Get her on the line.
Tom wants the best.
The human mind is magnificent.
There's no poison in this fish.
I want you with me.
I want to play golf.
Tom has taken a deep interest in art history.
They can't afford it.
I'm going to college.
Tom didn't see it.
Did you get any sleep?
Probably still available.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town, and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.
He was great at the concert.
There's no answer.
Tom told me he wanted me to buy him a picture.
This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it on.
You're concerned enough with worry.
I don't think Tom's gonna be much help.
Tom seems worried.
I care about him.
Tom is wonderful.
I'm proving Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting closer.
Tom seems shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom is compassionate.
Make it short, Tom.
Tom called to see if there was any way he could help.
We could've managed.
This is nobody's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're gonna be late.
Tom ran to the bathroom.
Let's go to lunch.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It has to be created from somewhere.
Weekends were fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, a football field and a pool table.
Tom claims he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young back then.
I hear you've been asking questions about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was bothering his sister.
We should have quit earlier.
That's close enough.
Tom is very polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My work so far has been futile.
"Why do you do that?" "I can."
You're such a pig.
Lock the gate.
Tom, turn on the heat.
We're all the same.
I want to be by your side.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that awful.
Well, I'm here for you.
You're allowed to come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my fault.
This sounds completely acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were more polaristic contradictions: one was sincere and trusted and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I will not bow down.
What were you and Tom doing last night?
I'm not going to fall for it.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at a butcher's shop.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why should I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
In the Irish, there's only two rolls.
One thing at a time, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's on his bed, and he's on the phone.
These are amazing.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was a man of war.
I'm eating pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I need a pass.
The noise is sucking up the whole city.
The one who likes flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't a joke.
They're getting closer.
You're evil.
Did you give Tom his note?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You got little breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you texting Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was making a deal.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears attacked clothes.
Tom was a boss.
That's ugly.
There could be discussions on that.
Chicks don't like you.
Time to get up.
This isn't your problem. This is mine.
Before I went to bed, I drank three cold pills.
It's possible that Tom is wrong.
They may need help.
I don't have any vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled little brat.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
We should ask him.
I'll bring them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave at.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is forever.
First of all, you have no right to make conclusions, and second of all, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I grow cattle.
She borrowed the line.
I'll see you.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mom had to lend me her keys.
Tom's got mustache.
There was a war going on.
Was Tom in on it too?
The thief turned into a cop.
We're gonna let Tom try it.
That would make sense.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom is angry and scared.
You're mean and you're repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom can't see it anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting in the park alone.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They completely renovated the facade of the building, and when I walked by her in a car, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's righteous.
I know you're busy.
All the kids were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom, forget it.
Invite him to join us.
It won't be easy to do without much help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works at a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They sedated her.
This isn't about the subject.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed deeply shaken by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we're not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm gonna get a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar is leaking.
They'll make wrinkles for you.
Tom's a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes snapped.
A geyser throws out hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom kept packing.
I don't have a home to go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
He's always been helping me out.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He says he wants to see you.
You were right, Tom.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get any of them?
Can you connect with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy himself a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I'm not good at math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be nice to the elderly.

Go find them.
You have to ask your mother for permission first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What'd you think of coming to Boston?
You're our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
Enough with the chickens.
It was a beautiful day.
I got him to take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I quickly had lunch.
Tom remembered a variety of different things that no one else remembered.
You can tell them easily.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I've ever learned, my French has been the easiest.
Tom did his homework.
I count to 200.
Watch this.
Shall I go?
Her boyfriend looks like a monkey.
The butterflies are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did he want?
We have a fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought it?
Did you get the money on loan?
Can't you just stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Think about your idea in particular.
Can I get a tattoo?
Everyone was so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'm gonna lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed at Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have homework.
He was breathing deeply.
That's terrible.
I'm not good enough for her.
That woman is easily disgraced.
You get there with a car?
I think maybe I can help her.
I'll do what suits me.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I've stepped on something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
It's a beautiful bracelet.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom yelled at Mary.
Were you alone at home?
He offered a great deal of money from her.
Can you help me deal with that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to come back and see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do this by yourself?
I'm gonna go find somebody else.
I'm starving.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make cobwebs.
You really talk a lot.
It might be too late.
Couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
Tom shouldn't always believe what they say.
He's in love with his head up to his heels.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a pain wound.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're wound!
It seems to be the only possible conclusion.
People ask me sometimes what I'm gonna do when I'm retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we eating?
Tom can do anything.
Soon the sound died.
Who hired you?
I don't really understand it myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll be there as soon as I'm fresh.
It's a police vehicle.

He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep walking.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired of sleeping without eating dinner.
How's Tom getting in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom didn't leave.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try calling her.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
I think I might sneeze.
Go ahead.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just quit.
Tom likes to swim.
I'm gonna scream.
I'm not your errand boy.
What's our status?
Do you want me to look after him?
You're a real man, you know that?
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who's in charge?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
No one's talking.
What made you think to contact them?
Nothing can be done.
Do you have anything?
It's not even a little cold.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don't want them to treat me any different than I used to.
They should be all right.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom is heartless.
I haven't seen that movie yet.
You already have.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who's laughing, but not who's crying.
How old are you, Tom?
He wore a red scarf around his neck.
The girl didn't say anything.
She was freezing.
There's one thing I don't understand.
You broke up listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say his party was gonna start?
This has obviously been Tom's hard decision.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan was very good at his job.
My legs still hurt.
I'd do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
Maybe I blacked out.
It's hard to gauge his ability.
That's good.
I know the man sitting over there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I'm open to everything.
I used to keep you safe.
Stand where they are.
Are you her pimp?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber cut it off.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
The nurse injected her with a flu shot.
Did you try talking to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom hasn't stayed here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while he was cleaning his gutters.
Do you have anything to add, Tome?
Quiet, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help it.
Damascus is in Syria.
All the compositions were good except yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be at school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We wait patiently.
Tom's a little pale.
Next year, my birthday's gonna fall off on Sunday.
Everyone laughed.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote these messages?
Tom's doing push-ups.
Tom was breathing deep.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to this cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought I was seeing things.
Tom looks lonely.
Should we try it again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it unless you show it to him.
You bought Mary something.
Nothing resembles a madman more than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom started taking off his clothes.
I know Tom's suffering.
It looks good.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all this noise.
Deal the cards, Tom.
The bandits tied his mouth up.
Give him a smile.
This medicine will ease the pain.
I'd like to buy you dinner.
Can't it wait?
They'll pay for their sustenance.
Dan didn't miss a single episode of that soap.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her just as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the entire area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom said I'd like to come visit him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everybody.
We'll be right here.
Why do they do that?
I went to college for four years, and I didn't get anything but this poor degree.
This is priceless.
Do you like to draw?
It was pretty gross.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was nothing left but ash.
Tom likes every vegetable except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his shoes.
Tom used to write lyrics.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make it up to you.
People can't work miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to shut him out of their company.
The ones who mix the verb endings, the "tanya" and "ttje" are waiting for a special spot in hell.
What happened?
Do you know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
Looks like they're all over the place.
I didn't count on it.
I was uncharted.
I just saw Tom this past week.
This shouldn't take long.
I'm trying not to worry.
Tom made it clean.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everybody can drive.
Tom digested two tubes.
He was lying in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom didn't make a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I've decided to contribute exclusively to Spanish sentences this month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You made something.
It's really bad.
Do you like cheese?
They say the eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
I guess I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't like surprises.
My wife is all brazen and pious.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I can pass the test.
I think we'll join.
Tom got ahead of himself.
Tom's keeping his car safe.
You're funny.
I can win this time.
All the people on Earth came from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I don't.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm neat.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your zipper's open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom doesn't go to the market.
I came to bring him a gift.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so silly as to think that the entire population of Georgia, which speaks a fractious language that doesn't even have a common phonemas or a common letters with English, can fully overpower English in just two years' time?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were done.

These are for them.
Do you really have to work this weekend?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom's right for me?
Tom's studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that a beautiful sound?
This isn't Tom's first time late.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate's very charming.
Where are you going?
Your path is difficult.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom took his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Take care of this mess.
Blood flows through blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom was wondering what a great singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not musical, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy that from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I'd very much like to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan picked up a lesson the hard way.
You showed my friends the forgery.
I'm giving my employees the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
Cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
Excuse me.
What kind of books do you need?

I have a big family.
No one can help me now.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and take a look.
Do you think you're likable?
Infinity is often a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's pulse is spiking.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is a lot of honor.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She was hard about how her boyfriend was kind, compassionate, brave, and I still don't know what.
Have you lied to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You're busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom watches TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.

That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in 1980.
Tom wants his life.
The shape of the skull is different from different people.
I've become uncomfortable with heterogmatic propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't take much longer.
Have a good reward on their own.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were doing.
I don't know how to behave here.
We should advertise on TV.
Tom noiselessly nodded.
They're not gonna help you.
I feel great.
They're not there.
Nothing's right for me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat blew a hole in the wall.
Tom hated us.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You should be happy for them.
This witness is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
I got all this stuff waiting for me.
Is this diamond real?
You know I don't eat meat.
She seems very sleepy.
Yesterday, I prepared a mushroom bagel.
I hope it works.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom's not gonna be home for lunch.
Is there a reward?
Believe in science!

The failure has embarrassed Lisa.

Tom passed out.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm on my way there right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The temperature at the surface of the sun is assumed to be around 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd just blew out.
Tom started working.
Tom wanted Mary to buy John a birthday present.
Cover him up.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the pit?
The bread is fresh out of the oven.
Tom's not gonna believe this.
I'm gonna get Tom to look into it.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
That's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
It's possible that Tom went.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did he want to eat, Tom?
I have Tom's keys.
Tom got turned down.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's 10: 00 sharp.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
Have you ever written Tom a letter?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Someone killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was so bad.
This must be yours.
We got here just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are adult expenses.
Tom and Mary were leaving fingerprints in the liquid cement.
Cavalier would never do anything like that.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was irresistible.
This is beautiful.
Tom, don't play with me on Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check in with you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I got him something.
I was gonna say no.
No one deserves to die.
I didn't know what that meant at the time.
Tom never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
What kind of situations would you do that in?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the coins.
Luckily, this asshole is stable, or the storm was going to crash last night.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got it all down somewhere.
There's no good news.
And who do you work for these days?
I'll quit.
Mary had her eyes polished with pleasure.
It's evil to swear.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's conservative.
How much you guys doing?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm sick of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's being secretive.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too fast.
You scared her.
Tom tricked us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom won't come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The seller double-crossed him.
Everything's in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid a fine.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you at home at 10: 00?
It's closed today.
Please notify Tom.
I'm gonna get her to help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom traveled to Boston.
I have plans for dinner with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple thing.
I hear he's got a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to speak to her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm waiting to see the new version of Tatoeba.
Everything seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did he really do that, Tom?
I didn't know how to play basketball at all.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to have been asked to make a speech.
Tom ain't no sport.
I'm stunned, Tom.
I can't see anything.
Call your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt so alone.
I really want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor after the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom's not laughing.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
You haven't eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did miracles.
The glands are pouring chemical substances into the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I gave her help.
Music unites.
This is just a simulation.
Good to see you, Tom.
I kind of felt sorry for her.
He's exceedingly generous.
Tom slept outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could have said no.
Why wouldn't I let me help?
It's gonna happen soon.
Hey, it's stuffy in here, get me out before I choke.
It's going to happen.
I heard that story.
It's still dark out there.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom alone out there?
I'll find her.
The police didn't find anything to tie Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom behaved decent.
I guess I'll just have to wait a little longer.
You can leave and stay wherever you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak up?
Where will the meeting be?
Let's play "Truth or Challenge."
His findings are based on untold assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom started tearing the book apart.
That's the real reason.
Tom loves flowers.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I blacked out.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very kind.
Do you know who I am?
Why aren't you listening?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren song to me.
I don't want you putting yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How long do you spend in front of a computer?
My wife is getting herself tired of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
The ammies are single-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long were you in Boston?
Tom twisted my arm.
You're crazy!
How late was the train?
Let's park over there.
That's so stupid.
It was hot yesterday, but today is more resilient.
I'm cold.
He was walking right in front of me.
Give it back.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston yesterday.
This is not right to me.
It's possible someone was onto them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
That's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a piggy bank.
I wish I'd met her.
He smiled.
I'd like to talk to him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He left soon.
The kids were so excited about the party they couldn't sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel so guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
You beat me.
Do you think we'll make it to the station in time?
Everything looked fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive.
An international language would be very useful to humanity.
I gave them help.
Have you made up your mind yet?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't fool me at all.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
You can't just leave a baby.
Tom's got mental problems.
Tom started eating.
She's good-natured.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Would you like some soda?
Tom winked at the girls.
We had a hell of a fight.
Tom seems different today.
Throw 'em off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different features.
It's upsetting.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
The monks used to play tennis after the monasteries.
Don't be such a pervert!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here for them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your salary.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom's got little nails.
You're scaring me.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam included math, physics and chemistry.
Tom's laundering money.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Well, didn't you say you can swim?
He's not pressuring Tom.
I was betrayed.
And there's no paper.
Tom can't express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll find a picture of you giving a speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb chops, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We've been waiting outside for them.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom's doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents got divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor is reviewing the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke is rising in the air.
The printer's dead.
I'll walk you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pushed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's doing much better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince is handsome.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary was representing her team in the competition.
Tom doesn't want a party.
Looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm an only child.
We don't want any more trouble.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have a lot of resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I was watching Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you getting so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
The mechanics should be able to understand each other in oils and motorcycle lubricates.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't just fire them.
They have families.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's have breakfast.
I love my omelet.
Tom explained to Mary the rules of detail.
Did you get him a dog?
You got sick, didn't you?
I totally forgot about him.
Interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled my knife.
They danced.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I go to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
A boy ran right up to me.
Tom looks very tired now.
I'll follow your instructions.
I built it.
Tom remained calm.
You said you'd help.
The cells are the basic component units of living beings.
They're slowing her down.
I need to go change.
How long have you been working as a doctor around here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukungrandma died a day after my older sister was born.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom picked the wine.
Tom doesn't have much of an appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom soon got lost in the crowd.
Just so you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a troublemaker.
This is hard for me.
Now how do you feel about her?
I'm not surprised.
That kind of amazes me.
This is the thing we discussed the other day.
I think Tom might be able to help.
Life is a deadly most transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn around at the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why are you stopping when we're kissing?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him one more chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is around here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would Tom like that?
I misjudged her.
It's almost over.
I didn't say I agree.
Did you know my father?
Tom was just about to shoot me.
Tom's snoring.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He can play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't say that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted a bigger boat than his brother.
God made peace.
Not too soon.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames of yellow windows.
Tom, are you in there?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
Like I blew it.
We have to wait here.
Is everything okay with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody talks about them.
Did Mike stop drinking liquor?
You and I will fly the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does the class start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour till the event.
You were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm rang.
The bird lifted up the twig with the beak and flew towards its nest.
Tom wanted to go.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
That depends on whether or not we buy it.
Tom's not the same man he was three years ago.
Everybody smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'm gonna ask Tom to save time for you first thing in the morning.
What the hell did you get?
Tom was struggling to free himself.
What do they want me for?
Tom didn't tell Mary anything.
This is not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
Tom ran past Mary.
A cat scratched me.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is, how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best.
I can't ask them now.
Tom's got wavy hair.
Long live the Soviet Union!
It's so cool.
I want to buy a pineapple.
I was home yesterday.
It's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
It's just a question.
The bush is on fire.
Tom was touched.
I got a bad conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Every country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Toads are wonder creatures.
He's got three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom got drunk with tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
Stop yapping.
We want more money.
Don't lose it.
Are you getting along with your folks?
Tom's doing something.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his cheek.
Don't you trust us?
I pay my respects to you.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I sleep, I hear music.
I'll pray for them.
Those keys are mine.
Was it a nice trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You have to make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom picked up the hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed outside.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom is very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one gets hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
Tom must have added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed his mind.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom kept climbing.
Tom might be able to start your car.
Did you hear that, too?
What did they find?
You lied to me in the eye.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to get out of here.
They're listening.
I didn't realize Tom did it.
If I ignore him, he'll be gone.
We'd just get in the way of Tom.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by mouth.
I don't have anything to give you.
They found an isolated beach and they spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on alert.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's for you.
That's a very suvorous explanation.
Ways before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
Wasn't it awful?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rough attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
He was framed for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We're all eager to see the movie.
It's simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing his shirt upside down.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not argue, shall we?
Dinner was so good!
Control yourself.
The knives are commutative, and the sharing isn't.
I'm picking on you.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's paper?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks from three to six coffees a day.
Tom was snoring too loud.
It was Beter.
Tom started snoring.
I'm gonna ask you to stay for a while.
We have two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed to her.
Maybe Tom will die by morning.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll be on time.
Tom was out of his mind.
This line is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why were you pretending to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom relaxed his arm.
Einstein considered himself a philosopher.
My parrata has clouded my glasses.
So, no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
It's a fact.
We were all rooting for her.
Didn't you see the English flag?
Cheer up!
I told you it would be hard to pull.
I think I found one of those.
You'll try, won't you?
Tom's been out of food all week.
I don't really understand you.
Even though I'm a blessed man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I should know about?
Tom's got to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't get so mad.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the reward.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
We have to do something.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How's your chest?
Tom drank in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom started saying something, but Mary put him up.
We met at the inn.
How was Tom acting?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Night life is better in New York.
Please come in.
This drug has to be drank on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is space black?
I had a bad dream.
I can't afford to pay anybody.
Tom said the house was haunted.
I baked you a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't rot.
Tom's come around.
Tom pissed Mary off.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom's good at it.
Tom might come today.
Tom doesn't know the difference between reality and imagination.
Tom's a hero.
Tom has no strength of will.
Will you help?
Don't you pass out on me.
Tom wasn't home when I came by.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, already.
You'd rather die on your feet than live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom seems sad.
I was home all night.
We came out of there at eleven o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
You used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found out who was talking, you only got 65.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it's from another dimension.
They bore me.
How's the weather?
I found the room empty.
I already wrote my part of the report.
I don't think they made up a cure for that yet.
Every member must attend.
You didn't understand her joke.
This is the ugliest snowman I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom is obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must be ticklish.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
Doesn't seem to be helping.
You have to let me deliver a message to Tom.
Where's my golf bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour are made of wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom didn't agree with Mary on that subject.
You're being made.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Lori.
Let's go back to Boston.
You look familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'm going to see Tom.
Did Tom buy presents?
You two are so cute together.
You're beautiful.
Tom and Mary had fun together.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan shot Linda's dog.
He cut his clavicle while he was playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
Show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's on his way down.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was innocent.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy has been fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something amazing happened.
Tom sticks to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please notify them.
I have to call her.
You asked me if I wanted something to cook.
Watch the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom roar.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't waste my nerves over it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave him to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the hair dresser.
Tom is completely insane.
Let's do it again!
It doesn't hurt his heart.
There should be no comment.
Chicken's raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
That time, Tom was swimming.
This penguin is so cute.
You're such a nerd.
We're sorry, but we don't accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look so distressed.
I could make it easy for you.
Put the phone down.
I would never get out of my house in slippers.
I think Tom's a blimp.
They fell out of a terrible infection and the ovarian was sweating.
I don't need counseling.
This is not good.
It's out of the question.
Tom's headed for the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
He's acting strange sometimes.
We'd hang them.
Now is probably not a good time for this.
I'll be back in a moment.
I have a list of her.
That was so stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things to do.
Trust in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take everything?
Who took the money?
I'm not incompetent.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're very influential.
I have a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we have some blackberry cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the most intelligent.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the topic.
She really wants to talk.
I have a ton of questions.
This is an interesting, funny, even distressing story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language views the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put your pajamas on.
This way.
This is holy ground.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday's in July.
We got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he can't play tennis.
Where did you find her?
This was on the top of the pile.
I'm done with it.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a heathen.
Tom hasn't talked to me since we got into a fight.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know whether to sit or run.
Don't you think it's pretty hot for demikvores?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Do you have a crush on him?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm calling her.
I lost track of time.
This island is American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked her a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many men does he fit in this room?
I already thought about that.
I would do anything for her.
Somebody must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You twisted your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little freaked out.
Tom decided to become a vegan.
I don't have time today.
Nobody wants to buy this stuff.
Not here or there.
Phone directories are fascinating.
No need to be defensive.
This is the most beautiful pizza in the whole city.
Mary obviously knows what she's doing.
Some things don't change.
