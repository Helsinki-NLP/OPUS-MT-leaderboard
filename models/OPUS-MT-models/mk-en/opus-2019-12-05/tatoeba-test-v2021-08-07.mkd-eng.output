I only practice to look good when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe Tom so much.
I owe Tom for this.
I paid a fine.
I plan to skip lunch.
I plan to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I prefer cat dogs.
I prefer goat cheese from the cow.
I prefer the eggs from the subterfuge.
I prefer black.
I'd rather sit down.
I'd rather walk alone.
I must sound ridiculous.
I promise you I won't do anything to hurt you.
I punched him in the jaw.
I pushed the button to turn on the radio.
I underline the word "Alice" to underscore it.
I suggested it.
I put three brown sugars in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I quit smoking classes.
I quit.
I grow cattle.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom a story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like the way your hair looks.
I really like this wine.
I love your website.
I really want your older sister.
I really missed you.
I really miss my mom's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I'd very much like to learn French.
It would really be nice to keep your mouth shut.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize that guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember meeting the queen.
I despise his rough attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I scared one.
The iron is stronger than the gold.
Isaac Newton died a virgin.
I said I'll get him.
I said it might rain.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I said yes.
Is anybody in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is something missing?
Last night I saw a ghost.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I saw him play cards with all of them.
I saw him over there.
I saw my sister tear the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far?
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are those potato chips?
I don't see any conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Is everyone busy?
Is everybody happy?
Everybody having fun?
Is everything there?
Is he breathing?
His aunt eats an apple or a banana?
I shook my head.
I should definitely get you a drink.
I should feel sorry for them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack.
I need to go change.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom's.
I should sue him.
I should take a look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I should have been more polite.
I should have checked it out.
I should have done it yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should have said no.
I showed her my room.
Cold out there?
Is it over?
Is it far from here?
Is Tatoeba really slow today, or is it me?
Is that your last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is it true?
I was slapping him.
I sleep on my feet.
I sleep standing up.
I slept like a castle.
I slept in the fireplace.
I slept on a bus.
I cut the sandwich in a nutshell.
Did Mike stop drinking liquor?
I smiled.
Isn't it exciting?
Isn't it possible that Tom did this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that excessive?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this too soon?
I kind of like it.
I spent all day polishing the snow.
Is she a cabbie?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really that beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I was staring at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I've stepped on something strange.
Is that all Tom's doing?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there even that word?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that sarcasm?
Is that comforting?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
And that's where Tom is, then?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you came?
Is that why you won't help him?
Is that why you won't help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hot?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Does it pay for delivery?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Does he have sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you'd like to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is this diamond real?
Is that moral?
Is this correct in English?
Is this Jupiter or bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is this your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this seat available?
Is this what all the excitement was about?
Is this your picture?
Is this your purse?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom left.
Somehow I still can't believe it.
I still don't get it.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don't understand women.
I still respect Tom.
I still want a horse.
I stole it from them.
Can Tom swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom conscious?
Does Tom take it?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is he looking for Tom?
Is it bothering you, Tom?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
Tom talk to you?
Is Tom alone out there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I lit a match in the dark.
I study art history.
Suddenly I felt old.
I'm suffering from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I suggest we concentrate on finding a way out of this cave.
I say we go home.
I suggest you bend over.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's what I suspected.
I'm proving Tom broke the window.
I was swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't get caught up with you and burn and you'd be the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Are you still working on the freezer?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm using an opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops drive me crazy.
I spoke to my advisors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
Everything seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It couldn't have been a coincidence.
So, no.
It can't be!
It's for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Never, but never at all, could that have happened here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
That'd be good.
I didn't mind.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get that bad.
That's what you've disappointed him.
It would look good.
I don't mind.
It's not gonna get better.
Doesn't look much different.
It doesn't matter what you don't want to do; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
Doesn't seem to be helping.
Doesn't sound like much.
That doesn't surprise me.
I teach Chinese.
I teach him English.
It's just me.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do with.
It had to be done.
It has to be created from somewhere.
Depends on your decision.
It happened too fast.
It's going down.
It happens.
It's getting cold.
It's not about luck.
It wasn't easy.
It's got sentimental value.
I mean it all day long.
I think about him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something.
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one of those.
I think I might have caught a cold.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I mean, I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm gonna go eat outside.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I spoke nicely.
I think I'm writing pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I might sneeze.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it's time for you to go now.
I think it's time we started getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I figured out what time we should leave at.
I think I was wrong.
I think maybe I can help her.
I think it's good dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's terrible.
I think that's silly.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom might be able to help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom is heartless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom is cruel.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's evil.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's being petty.
I think Tom's a blimp.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's on the hook.
I think Tom's superstitious.
I think Tom is resourceful.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's going to go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
We'd better not go out in a storm like this.
I think we'll join.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I think we've eaten enough.
I think we found one.
I think it worked.
I think you did it on purpose.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you panicked.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this alone.
I think you can help me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
I think they lied to you.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should handle this on your own.
I think you've helped enough.
I've thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking about you.
I thought he had bigger titties.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd get him some help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I'd lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought I was seeing things.
I thought you'd already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom came from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
I didn't think Tom would want any help.
I didn't think Tom would want to go with us.
So didn't we get along?
I thought we could help you.
I thought we could sit here for a while and talk.
I thought we'd visit the museum together.
I think you're gonna have to work your ass off.
Well, didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found someone else.
I thought you'd lost your wristwatch.
So don't you hate him?
He seemed tired.
I thought maybe you could help.
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
I thought you only went out with girls that were lower than you.
Well, didn't you know how to play the piano?
Well, didn't you say you can swim?
Well, didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you played chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you were gonna live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I didn't think you'd be busy.
I didn't think you'd like it, Tom.
I'm having a terrible pain here.
Mary gets upset when Tom leaves the toilet seat up.
It's a more factual process.
That depends on whether or not we buy it.
It's his first day of school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no way in theory that I can get this job done in one day.
Today is less moist than yesterday.
It's not even a little cold.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use that?
I'm paying.
It's out of the question.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It's starting to get in our head that we can't get over nature.
Today is warmer than yesterday.
It's worth quoting a famous passage of his essay.
It's written on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
Kind of seems wrong to me.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
Happens all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
It's almost Christmas.
It's gonna be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
She looked awful.
It looked funny.
I guess you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
It seems familiar.
Looks like an egg.
I guess I drank too much last night.
These two seem to be having another relationship.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Looks like we're gonna have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks good.
That's how I got close to Tom.
He brushed me.
You're scaring me.
It could be dangerous.
It might be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It may have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll rain tonight.
It may seem strange.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me that time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you.
I told you I can't do it.
I told you it would be hard to pull.
I told you my father died when I was 13.
I told you this was gonna get rough.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of it.
I got my shit together.
I'm back on the bus.
I took Tom to lunch.
My pants broke.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I completely understand.
It's probably not worth waiting for.
It was raining two days ago.
He's been a major pain in the ass.
I tried to explain to him, but he wasn't digging.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to get them to stop.
I tried to pretend to be something I'm not.
I truly regret it.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to worry.
He's about to rain.
It's a classic.
It was a disaster!
It's more recommended to check for any adverse effects if you're drinking when you're drinking the medicine they prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
Everything's in the room.
It's over for us.
It's all over now.
That's all they talk about.
It's all very strange.
It's almost over.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She almost got to go.
It's so fun.
It's 7: 00 already.
It's 11: 00 already.
It's already open.
It's an insignificant mistake.
It's a miracle you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
It's a reasonable compromise.
It's a fake lead.
It's a risky plan.
Too bad the concrete's not burning.
It's moving fast.
It's a simple thing.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it's gonna take a lot of work.
They tore it apart.
Just give me a hard time.
It's been raining for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
It's been too long.
This week is extremely hot.
It would be best if you didn't talk so much.
You better be alone.
It's better to be an optimist and fool yourself than to be pessimistic and be right.
"It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
It's empty.
Sona's here.
It's a new paper.
You scared me.
There's no one here.
It's closing time.
It's cold in here.
It's generally known that you don't like Tom.
It's dark in here.
It's deeper than that.
It's definitely them.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to gauge his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's upsetting.
It's easier this way.
It's easier not to end up in prison than then run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can tell them easily.
I guess I misjudged him.
It looks like her style.
It seems to be the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's evil to swear.
It's 10: 00 sharp.
That's exactly what happened before.
It's very rare.
It's righteous.
Fair enough.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
He's dressing up.
It's getting dark.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be a big one.
It's gonna get colder.
It's gonna happen soon.
Good to see you all again.
That's good training.
It's good.
It's improved.
It's so fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's warm here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
It matters to me how you feel about Tom.
It's impossible for him to give up smoking.
It's impossible to get out of this cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in great condition.
It's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's just a question.
It's just made up.
He's just sitting there.
He's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It's made of leather.
It's my call, Tom.
It's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to wear these gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's no big deal.
It's no big deal.
It's noisy here.
None of your business!
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
That doesn't have a high priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It won't be easy to do without much help.
It's not hard to point out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's no big deal.
It's not just a guess.
It's not a common pen.
There's not enough light to read here.
It's not like we're doing anything.
It's not my call.
It's not my fault.
It's not necessary.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
Not too soon.
It's not up to you.
It's not often that someone buys a $1,000 hat.
It's not worth much.
It was snowing last night.
It's obviously a typo.
It's obvious to all of us that he's in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds pretty cool.
Sounds pretty good.
It's our job to help them.
It's totally white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
He's probably still got it.
Probably still available.
It's flat.
It's actually quite common.
It's delicious.
It's very possible that I'm wrong.
It's entirely possible that Tom won't help us at all.
It's simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really bad.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
Oh, that's so cool!
It's awesome!
It's so obvious we don't need proof.
It's getting dark.
It's still dark out there.
It's still for sale.
It's still working.
It hasn't welded yet.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's funny how people in tropical zones eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
His surface was flat like a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best turkey I've ever tasted.
It's a spider bite.
I'm so scared!
It's time to get to work.
Time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It's too risky to fight them in a place of their choosing.
It's so cool.
It's bullshit.
It's all wrong.
You can't hold on to this heat.
It's unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really warm.
I need to see Tom immediately.
It's very relaxing.
It's very simple to understand.
It's hot in here.
I have no idea.
There's wind.
It's work.
Your loss.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
Water only takes three minutes to boil.
All night long.
It took a lot more than I thought it would last.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're unexpectedly crafty.
I turned on the fan and I pointed it against the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I said no to Tom.
It was a great honor to have been asked to make a speech.
It was just beautiful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
This has been a good day.
It was a great show.
It was all my idea.
It was all right here.
Everything was so easy.
It was an amazing night.
It was an ambush.
It was a horrible sight.
It's been an honor.
It was an offer I couldn't refuse.
It was my duty to spend the evening with a smart, funny, beautiful girl like you.
It was a remarkable experience.
It was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a hard test.
It was a warm night.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a great day.
It was a wonderful evening.
That kind of behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was them.
Yesterday was fun.
He was asleep.
She was freezing.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
Nice of you to buy Tom a nice present like that.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It wasn't easy solving this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty gross.
It has been proven that dog-living fleas jump higher than those who live on cats.
It was so magnificent.
That was pretty funny.
It was so cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really sweet.
That was very touching.
He was a real pain in the ass.
It was amazing.
It was necessary.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was creepy.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture on the chimney.
It was Tom.
It was too small.
It was unfortunate.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was irresistible.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very suffocating in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Beter.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I won't be lonely here.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
It's not gonna help lies.
It's not gonna help you.
It works well.
It would be so normal to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk by tomorrow if I get to explain everything to you.
I need you right away.
I used to keep you safe.
I used to dream of being a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I already packed.
I've already read it.
I already wrote everything that was supposed to be written.
I already wrote my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always wanted not to say too much.
He's always been helping me out.
I always thought you were from Boston.
I've always wanted to get one of these.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
I've already asked them all.
I asked Tom to help you.
I baked her a cake.
I baked them a cake.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
I've been a little overburdened with something else.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
I've had a lot worse.

You better go.
You better let me do it.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
He deserved better.
You would have done the same thing in my shoes.
You did a bad job.
You did a good job.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
You weren't listening.
You didn't see anyone come in, did you?

You don't even like fish.
You got sick, didn't you?
You wouldn't happen to have a key, would you?
You don't know how much time yet.
You don't have to be insane to work here.
This son of a bitch, you know that.
You don't know anything.
You wish you knew.
You don't really like Tom, do you?
You shouldn't be there for this.

You know me better than it seems.
