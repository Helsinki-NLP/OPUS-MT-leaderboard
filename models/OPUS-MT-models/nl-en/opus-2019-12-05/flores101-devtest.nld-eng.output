This not only proves the already widespread theory that at least certain dinosaurs had feathers, but also offers more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional placement.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown with a pale or carotenoid colored underside.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
The researchers concluded that the rachis was probably a later evolutionary development, because dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, or a rachis, but do have other characteristics of feathers - such as barbs.
The structure of the feathers seems to indicate that they were not used to fly, but to control the temperature or how it looked. The researchers suggested that this is the tail of a young dinosaur, but that this monster shows mature feathers and therefore not the down of a chick.
The researchers suggested that, despite the fact that it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the monster had the feathers of an adult and not the down of a chick.

The completed work was mainly theoretical in nature, but the program was written for the simulation of observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The team was looking for the effect that would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the universe and that of the galaxy.
Similar to how the moon exerts power on the earth, which leads to tides, the Milky Way exerts power on the galaxy of Sagittarius.
The researchers concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter in a galaxy is around, in a kind of circle, and consists of a large amount of smaller particles.

What is consistent is that it is deep holes in the ground', said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Team and of the Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voices have traditionally hardly needed technology: voters go into a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope on which they vote.
Officials first check the identity of the voter. Then the voter moves the envelope into the ballot box and then puts his signature under the ballot.
The process is relatively closely enshrined in the electoral law of France.
Vote boxes must be transparent since 1988 so that both voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes in them at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added other than those of registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the trial. Volunteers count the votes in the evening under strict supervision and according to specific procedures.

In the other game she participated in, the sitting Grand Slalom, she became tenth of the ladies, with a combined time of 4:41:30. That is 2:11:60 minutes slower than the Austrian winner Claudia Loesch, and 1:09:02 minutes slower than the Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished ninth.
Four skiers from the women's group for the sitting slalom could not finish their rides and 45 of the 117 skiers in the giant slalom did not manage to place themselves during the race.
The stolen laptop and cell phone were recovered by the Madhya Pradesh police.
According to Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya, five of the Swedish women's rapists were arrested and found her cell phone and laptop.
Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar are the suspects.
According to police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the suspects had covered their faces when they appeared in court.
There were three people in the house when the car hit the house, but none of them got hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed while the emergency services tried to free the driver from the red Audi TT.
At first he was admitted to Great Yarmouth, at the James Paget Hospital.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been convicted of murdering her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She's in custody pending the charges and the trial, but the eyewitness's report may have been compromised because her story has been published on numerous occasions.
This is common practice in the rest of the UK, but justice in Scotland works differently and courts have described the publication of photos as potentially detrimental.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that 'journalists play a dangerous game when they publish photos of suspects.'
Crown Office is overall in charge of prosecutions and has indicated to journalists that no further statements are made, at least until charges have been filed.
According to sources, the document refers to a dispute settlement, something the Palestinians wanted on the basis of the borders before the war in the Middle East in 1967.
Other topics discussed were the future status of Jerusalem, a city sacred to both peoples, and the problems in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that there be a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after an agreement has been signed, but the PA is only willing to attend for five years.
Shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by forest rangers because the test was followed and its effectiveness assessed.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's yacht program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director for Park Conservation and Heritage at the NPWS, the four chosen shooters had extensive safety and training instructions for the first shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore to a nine-headed new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
With this, Martelly has achieved five CEPs in the last four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous National Election Council, which is part of a package of measures to ensure that new elections are held in the country.
The committee was set up by Martelly in response to the widespread protests against the government that have taken place since October.
The sometimes violent protests were caused by the absence of elections, some of which should have taken place since 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reports of defective iPods overheating, resulting in six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it was familiar with the 27 accidents associated with the devices.
Last week METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that the company called 'not serious'.
'Very regrettable', was the response of the Ministry to the fact that Apple delayed the report.
Mariana was struck by the earthquake at 07.19 hours local time (Friday 21.19 GMT).
The Department of Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands stated that no damage has been reported nationally.
In addition, the National Tsunami Warning Center reported that there was no tsunami warning.
In Manila, the Philippines capital, a former policeman from the Philippines has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza shot the tourists.
Several hostages have been brought to safety and at least six victims have been confirmed for the time being.
Six hostages were released earlier, including the children and elders, and the Filipino photographers.
Later the photographers returned in exchange for an older woman who had to go to the bathroom. Mendoza was eventually shot.
Liggins went to work in medicine and followed his father's example.
He was educated as an obstetrician at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When he was working at the hospital, Liggins did research into early birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the maturation of the fetal lungs of babies was accelerated by the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua has reported that government researchers found two 'black boxes' with flight recorders on Wednesday.
Also fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said that "Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even weirder... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1400 people questioned before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Demissionary Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of the participants in this poll supported this position, and they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last sovereign of Australia.
29 percent of respondents felt Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and at the other end, 31 percent said that should never happen.
The Olympic gold medal winner swam the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relay games during the Commonwealth Games, but his condition was questioned because of his complaints.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to ease his pain because they're forbidden at the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on 25 January.
Several people verified the discovery early February using various hardware and software and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source that brought water to Earth, along with organic material that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to gain insight into the way planets are created. They especially want to know how the earth was created, given that it has been a long time since comets collided with the Earth.
Cuomo (53) was inaugurated as governor earlier this year and signed a law last month that legalizes marriages between people of the same sex.
He called the gossip "political nonsense and chatter."
It is speculated that he intends to run for President in 2016.
The NextGen system would allow aircraft to take shorter routes according to the FAA, saving millions of tonnes of fuel each year for lower carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older ground radar technologies, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft much better, and to provide pilots with clearer information.
There is no additional transport and no above ground trains stop at Wembley, as well as the parking spaces and the P&R are not accessible on site.
A possible lack of transport increased the chance that the game would be played behind closed doors and without supporters.
A study published in the scientific journal Science on Tuesday was about the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species evolved within two generations. It was thought that this process lasted much longer because the crosses of an indigenous darwin finch, the Middle Groundfinch, with an immigrated Cactus Groundfinch, the Española Groundfinch, lasted longer.
Gold can be worked into many forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into a narrow wire that can be twisted and braided. It can also be forged or rolled in plates.
After it is made very thin, it can be glued to another metal. It can even be made so thin that it was sometimes used for the decoration of hand-painted illustrations in books called 'enlightened manuscripts'.
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You already make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the coal juice then changes based on the acidity (acid to basic or alkaline) of the chemical.
The amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical tested shall be used to indicate the pH value.
Hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron, and hydrogen ions are protons without electrons.
Mix both dry powders together, wet and clean your hands and make a ball of them.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of shell.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to an advanced sewage system.
Sewers have been found in houses in the Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
There were also toilets in China, Egypt and Persia in antiquity. For example, toilets in the era of the Romans were often part of a popular bath house, in which both ladies and gentlemen came together in a mixed group.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
As soon as the space satellite receives the call, it will be returned immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and image.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, you have to have a huge rocket that is more than 30 meters long.
The wheel has changed the world incredibly, and the most important thing that the wheel has given us is an easier and faster transport.
The train, the car and many other means of transport are the result of this.
There are average size cats between those prey eat of medium size, from hares to antelopes and deer.
In addition, there are many small cats (such as loose cats kept as pets) that hunt for larger numbers of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
Their success comes from the idea of a niche, a special job that every cat has so that they don't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called troops.
Troops consist of one to three adult males who are related to each other and also have up to thirty females and cubs.
The women are normally closely related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pack of lions behaves almost the same as a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not similar to other large cats), and that are very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a versatile athlete and can climb (although not well), swim, jump large distances and has five times as much pull as a strong person.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
A tiger doesn't roar out of full power like a lion. It's more like he growls a whole sentence.
The favorite food of ocelots are small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they succeed. The ocelot hunts almost exclusively for animals that are much smaller than they themselves are.
Scientists suspect that oceans use their sense of smell to hunt small animals (their prey), by smelling on the ground where they have been.
Through night vision they can see very well in the dark and move very unobtrusively. Ocelots hunt for prey by making themselves one with the environment and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes detached from the large population from which they originate (for example by moving over a mountain range or river, or when they are moved to another island, from where they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In this new environment there are other raw materials and other enemies, so the new population needs to change or adapt to cope with competition.
Because they still need the same adjustments as before, the original population has not changed at all.
As the new population began to adapt to the new environment, they also started to look less and less like the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from appearance, that you can no longer call them the same species.
This process is called species formation and simply involves the formation of new species. Species formation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that inhales people and they absorb carbon dioxide that exhales people.
By means of photosynthesis, the plants extract their nutrients from the sun. They also provide shade.
Our homes and clothing are made of plants, we mainly eat plants, without plants animals would not survive.
The Mosasaur was at the top of the food chain of that time. He had nothing to fear from anyone except other Mosasaurs.
His long jaws had over 70 razor sharp teeth, plus an extra set in the palate, which means that nothing or no one could escape him.
It's not certain, but possibly his tongue was forked. It ate turtles, big fishes, other mosasaurs and perhaps even his own kind.
There was nothing safe from the attacks in the water; also giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex were no match for him.
Although most of their food would be trusted for us, the Romans also had their portion of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a kind of rodent called a sleep mouse.
There was also a difference; poor people and women sat on chairs while eating, but rich men liked to have a banquet together where they were lounging on their side while eating.
Meals from Roman antiquity do not contain any food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa. Moreover, no ancient Roman has ever eaten a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for all their gods, and this temple was seen as the house of that god.
Sacrifices were made to the gods and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods by organizing ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had a public courtyard and a backroom that was only accessible to priests.
Sometimes, as part of the temples, towers were built in the form of pyramids, called gypsies.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
Houses were not of great importance in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The daily life of the Hebrew family often took place outside.
Women cooked in the garden; shops were nothing more than a counter along the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests and therefore wood was hugely expensive.
Greenland still had few inhabitants. According to Norwegian sags, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, found Greenland on its way west and gave it its name.
He made this discovery, but at that time all Eskimo tribes lived there.
Although they were all 'Scandinavian' countries, the persons, the royal family, customs and history of Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Norway were very different.
Maybe after the movie National Treasure, you think there's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is based on a misconception. Something is written on the back, but it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the American Declaration of Independence are the words 'Original American Declaration of Independence, dated 4 July 1776'. The text is upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is certain that the large parchment (of 291⁄4 inches at 241⁄2 inches) has been rolled up before for storage.
So it seems that the designation has just been added as a kind of label.
Thanks to the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, the north of France was liberated. However, the south remained occupied.
It was ruled by Vichy-France. These were Frenchmen who joined the Germans in 1940 and thus lived with the enemy instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France with Operation Dragoon.
The Americans and the Free French had liberated the south of France within just two weeks. Then they went on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in a society.
From the Latin civilis, which means bourgeois, comes the term civilisation, related to the Latin civis, which stands for citizen, and civicis, which means city or city state; and that also defines in a certain way the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations. A civilization with a culture suggests that knowledge is passed on over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and balanced dissemination.
When minority cultures disappear, they often leave no relevant historical evidence behind, thus not officially recognised as civilizations.
During the revolution thirteen states under the articles of the Confederacy formed a weak central government, consisting only of a congress.
Congress lacked the power to levy taxes, because there was no national executive or judiciary and relied on state authorities to implement all decisions that often did not want to cooperate.
Nor did it have the power to ignore tax laws and rates between states.
First, all states had to agree unanimously to the articles before they could be adapted, but the states did not take the national government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German team worldwide, is the second most successful team and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, sword fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are particularly popular in the northern regions, where Italians participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of almost 7,000 islands (the largest island of Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands available to Japan, Japan is geographically often referred to as a 'territory'.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when sailors from Europe sailed along the island and gave it the name Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch VOC established itself in the southwest of Taiwan as a base, where the VOC handled the indigenous cereal production processes and put Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 the western and northern coasts of Taiwan were conquered by Qing Dynasty men (1644-1912), after which Taiwan was incorporated into the Qing Empire province in 1885.
After the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed in 1895 the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transfers sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governs the island until 1945.
Built up of three large structures, the Machu Picchu consists of Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better picture of what they looked like before.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the renovation is still under way.
For example, worldwide the most common photo format for still images is 35 mm, which was the usual film format in the end of the analog film age.
These are produced to this day, although it is mainly the ratio of the image that took over the image sensor of the digital camera.
Oddly enough, 35 mm film is actually 36 mm wide, at a height of 24 mm.
The aspect ratio of this size (parts by twelve to get the simplest ratio of whole numbers) would in that case be 3:2.
Many common classifications (e.g. APS-like formats) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of third parties, which is widely abused and which many people find ridiculous, is a simple directive which makes the image dynamic, yet clear.
The most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines. Thus, you divide the image vertically and horizontally into three parts (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the rich and powerful Catholic church was under attack.
For over a thousand years Christianity has been linking European states, despite linguistic differences and differences in habits.
From the king to the ordinary citizen, his all-pervading power affected everyone.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that prosperity must be used to combat suffering and poverty, and the Church has funds for this reason.
The church had been the central authority in Rome for over a thousand years, and this relationship of power and money led many people to doubt whether this principle was being respected.
Britain imposed a blockade at sea against Germany shortly after the outbreak of hostilities.
The strategy proved effective, because it was no longer possible to provide vital services to military and civilian forces, but this blockade violated the generally accepted international law that has been enshrined in various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain has laid mines in international waters, so that ships could no longer sail throughout the ocean, which was dangerous even for neutral ships.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar reaction to the uninhibited submarine warfare of the country.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations had an attitude of pacifism and isolation.
After the First World War, states wanted to prevent such horrors from ever happening again.
Tesla emigrated to the United States of America in 1884 to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
When he came to the United States, he only had 4 cents, a poetry collection and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former boss) for Thomas Edison.
Old China had a unique way of displaying different time periods; each stage of China or every ruling family had a distinctive dynasty.
Also between the different dynasties there was an unstable period in which the provinces were divided. The best known was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which took place in the 60 years between the Han and the Jin Dynasty in.
During that time, fierce wars took place between different nobles who fought for the throne.
In the history of ancient China, the era of the Three Kingdoms stands as one of the bloodiest. Thousands of people died in battle for the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The Revolution has had great social and political consequences, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolute monarchy to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to its inhabitants instead of a single leader.
All male applicants were able to obtain post revolution positions, so that the most ambitious and suitable candidates could succeed.
The military ranks are no longer based on one's class but on the calibre of the person.
The French Revolution also inspired the oppressed working class in other countries to revolutionize.
Muhammad dealt intensively with supernatural issues. He often went for reflection to a cave that later became known as the Hira Cave in the Mountains of Noer.
The cave itself, which has endured the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave is located on one of the peaks on the north side of Mecca and is completely closed from the rest of the world.
Even if the cave was known to exist, it was not easy to find. Once inside the cave there is total isolation.
The only thing to see are the bright, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains. There is very little to see or hear from the cave of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built in the third century BC by the Egyptians and belongs to the numerous large pyramid structures in honor of a dead pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza Pyramids in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, a number of temples and the large sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu. Many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to pay tribute to the women and relatives of Khufu.
The up-bow character looks like a V and the down-bow character looks like a staple or a square the bottom of which is missing.
Above means you have to start at the tip and push the bow stick away. Under means you have to start with the bow frog (the place where your hand holds the bow stick) and put on the bow stick.
An upward movement usually gives a softer sound, while a downward movement produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
Take the freedom to paint your personal characters, but remember that the printed strings are there for a musical reason, so they usually have to be respected.
On 6 October 1789 a group of market women were behind the departure of Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie Therese of 11 and Louis-Charles of 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, from Versailles to Paris.
They drove back to the French capital in a carriage surrounded by roaring and threatening mobs that threatened the King's couple.
The actions of the crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage completely.
At some point someone in the crowd held the head of a royal guard who was murdered in Versailles up in front of a terrified queen.
The cost of the U.S. imperialism in relation to the conquest of the Philippines has been paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were imposed on the U.S. colonial regime to pay taxes to finance a large part of the costs and the interest on bonds was issued through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the Filipino government.
American imperialism largely relied on the huge profits of the long-term exploitation of the Philippines.
In order to understand the Templars one must know what the context was that gave rise to the order.
The era in which this happened is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
After the early Middle Ages came the high Middle Ages, followed by the late Middle Ages, which usually end around 1500.
Technological determinantism is a term for a wide range of ideas in practice: from technology supply or the technological obligation to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their appearance in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinantism have these two general views: the development of technology follows a pathway that is largely beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has 'effects' on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, some will say that the arrival of the car automatically leads to the construction of roads.
However, a rural road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, which is why new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also causes a greater number of road accidents and this leads to the development of new health care techniques in order to restore the human body.
Romance included a large part of cultural determinantism, which came from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In Romantic times, geography formed the individual and over time, customs and cultures arose as a result of this geography, which formed a harmonious society and were better than arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe, as Paris is the current fashion capital.
It was known as an epicenter of luxury from about 400 AD until about 1100 AD.
The status of the empire declined in the 12th century, mainly because the crusaders returned with silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
Around this time, Paris also took over the title of fashion capital of Constantinople.
The Gothic fourth are heydays in the 10th, 11th and 14th centuries.
Clothing was in the beginning strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture from the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west were 25 to 30 years behind.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments was the result of the crusades: people began to use knots to confirm their clothes.
Self-sufficient agriculture is agriculture where sufficient food is produced to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Agriculture with the aim of livelihood is a simple system that is mostly organic, using stored seed from the ecoregion, combined with changing crops or other relatively simple techniques to optimise the yield.
Most farmers used to work in self-sufficient agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures ensure that like-minded people who feel neglected by social standards are brought together, giving them the opportunity to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of their members.
A subculture can be determined by the following qualities: linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or one or more of these factors combined.
Members of a subculture often show which group they belong to through a certain symbolic style in what they wear, in how they behave and the jargon they speak.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization was the few regrettable cases of children who were not socialised by adults due to neglect, adversity or deliberate abuse during growing up.
They are called 'wolf children' or 'wild children'. Some wolf children have been locked up by people (usually their own parents); sometimes this child was abandoned because the parents would not accept the severe mental or physical disability of the child.
Unruly children may have experienced serious child abuse or severe trauma before they were abandoned or before they ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived only in the wilderness.
A wild child who has not been raised by humans may exhibit behavior similar to the behavior of the animal that has taken care of the child (within the physical limits), such as fear of or indifference towards people.
Learning on a project basis should simplify education and make it more interesting, but scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a tool to support individuals who have to do with a new learning experience, such as a new computer program or start a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real. For example, a teacher is a form of support, but so is Microsoft Office's paper clip man.
There is virtual scaffolding that is built into the software that asks questions, provides reminders and explains procedures that may be difficult to understand for students without help.
There are several reasons why children end up in foster care, such as neglect, abuse and exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not well cared for, where one does not care about them and where they cannot develop, yet this is happening.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe zone for these children.
The aim is for foster care to ensure a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
In foster care, all needs that were neglected in the previous home must be met.
On the Internet, components of interpersonal and mass communication are merged.
The different characters of the Internet lead to new dimensions in the application of the Uses & Gratifications theory.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialisation' are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) introduced new motivational aspects such as 'personal engagement' and 'persistent relationships' when they investigated public reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to remarkable findings in interpreting micro-expressions, that are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is stated that no one can recognize a lie by watching only micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks described in his essay The President's Speech how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately assess its sincerity.
He even suggested that other species, such as house dogs, also have the ability to interpret people's behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: hidden and visible.
By mutation, new genetic variation is added; by selection this variation is eliminated from the pool of expressed variation.
For each generation, separation and recombination vary between the two groups.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of man can hardly extract the necessary amino acids from the plant sources that can be found on the savannah.
Furthermore, it can not take account of serious consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition and eventually even death.
The easiest plant sources to find are the proteins in leaves and legumes, but unless cooked, they are hard to digest for primates like us.
Not only is animal food (ants, termites, eggs) easily digestible, but it also contains a lot of proteins that contain all essential amino acids.
All in all, we should not be surprised when our ancestors solved their 'protein problem' in the same way as chimpanzees on the savannah solve this problem today.
Sleep interruption means that you wake up for a reason during your normal sleep period and that within a short time (10-60 minutes) you fall asleep again.
This is quite easy by using a relatively soft alarm clock that brings you back to your consciousness without immediately waking up completely.
If you turn off your clock in your sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room. This way you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythm, for example, are drinking a lot of liquid before you go to sleep (especially water or tea, a known diuretic), which means you have to get up to pee.
The amount of inner calm that a person possesses is against the amount of stress that a person carries in his or her body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive the life force that exists. Every human being is able to achieve satisfaction and total rest.
Everyone can lighten his or her mind, and only your own stress and negativity stand in the way of this goal.
Tibetan Buddhism has its basis in the teachings of Buddha. However, this form of Buddhism has been expanded with the mahayana path of love and with a large number of techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism consists of a relatively simple core of kundalini yoga, meditation and a imitation of universal love.
Through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualized images, the energy of Kundalini-yoga (lighting energy) is generated.
The core of Tibetan meditation is yoga with a deity as its focus. Using the visualization of different deities, energy channels are cleaned up, chakras are activated and consciousness is brought into an enlightened state.
Because Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, a cooperation was established between the USSR and the US. When the war was over, the conflicts between system, process and culture caused the countries to fight with each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies faced each other, this was the beginning of the Cold War.
The war would last for 40 years and fighting with proxylegers took place on battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defence forces only continued until 17 September 1939, after which they had to withdraw and reorganise along the bridgehead in Romania.
However, these plans were obsolete overnight, when 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded and formed the Latvian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern parts of Poland, in violation of the peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty and other international peace treaties that were both bilateral and multilateral.
Ship transport of goods is the most efficient way of transporting large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
Traditionally, it is the Navy's job to ensure that a country retains the ability to transport persons and goods, while hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
The US tried to get troops and material across the Atlantic to the British and with this North Atlantic campaign of WWII this is one of the most remarkable recent examples.
The German Navy simultaneously tried to stop this traffic using mainly U-boats.
Like the rest of Europe, Britain would probably have fallen into German hands if the Allies had failed.
It seems that the goats were domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago for the first time.
In ancient times, cultures and tribes began to keep them so that they could always easily touch hair, meat, milk and skins.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds on a hill or other grazing area. They were then guarded by goatsherds, just like the more famous sheepherd often a child or younger. Nowadays, the same way is still kept.
Already in the 16th century horse railroads were built in England.
Although horse tracks consisted only of a track of shelves, the horses had to walk faster and carry larger quantities than on the slightly difficult roads of that time.
Cross-beams were used quite early to keep the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient if there was an iron point on the top.
This soon became the usual practice, but the iron resulted in more wear on the wooden carriage wheels.
Iron wheels eventually replaced the wooden variants. In 1767 the first fully iron rails were constructed.
The first form of transport we know is walking. People started walking upright two million years ago when the Homo Erectus came up (that means standing up man).
Their predecessor, the Australopithecus, was less often upright.
Two-legged specialisations were found in fossils of the Australian society of 4.2-3.9 million years ago, and the Sahel anthropus may have been on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly lives, join an environmental movement or even take action to alleviate future suffering.
In many cases it is like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we have to identify the cause of the problems and eliminate them.
The scientific and technological developments of human society have clearly changed the Earth. Moreover, overpopulation and the extravagant human lifestyle have exacerbated the problems.
After the declaration of independence was adopted by Congress on 4 July, a handwritten design was sent to John Dunlap's printing works a few blocks away. This design was signed by the President of the Continental Congress John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made. These are now better known as 'Dunlap broadsides'.
John Nixon held the public reading of the document for the first time on 8 July in the garden of Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on 6 July and read to his troops on 9 July in New York. Another copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap writings are the oldest surviving copies of the document and the original handwritten copy did not survive.
Many paleontologists believe that today there is still a dinosaur species. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still remind of a dinosaur.
On their legs are claws and scales, laying eggs and walking on their two back legs, just like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Manipulating data encoded in binary digits is the basis for almost all computers used today.
A binary number can only have two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits (and in computer language 'bits').
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so common that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The presence of open boxes of medicines or toxic household chemicals is the best indication of internal poisoning.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for that exact poison.
This insect group is formally called 'bugs' by entomologists.
This term comes from an ancient similarity with bedbugs, which are insects that can very well parasitize on humans.
Both red predator bugs and bedbugs are nest-bound, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
In the US, there are about 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the main neurological disorder in adults of both younger and middle age.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, the spine and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women have twice as much chance of getting MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest, or that of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to give up their baby for adoption.
When adopted, parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
Finding out how the world works on the basis of the scientific method is the main purpose of science, which is the guideline for most scientific research.
However, it is more than just testing; a test is a test to exclude one or more potential assumptions, to question and to make observations, as a guideline for scientific research.
Natural connoisseurs and philosophers focused on classical texts and in particular on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on science, including psychology, were accepted.
The West understood Greek philosophy and science less and less, as the knowledge of Greek declined.
In physiological and behavioural observations of rhythms there is often a strong dependence on endogenous processes and production via the biological clock.
Most creatures, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, live according to periodic rhythms. These are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
Biological clocks are self-sufficient oscillators that cycle for a given period of time, even if they are not given external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the most important indications that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacteria.
Two experiments were carried out, one experiment marked the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus and the other experiment marked the phage's protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have many different effects, depending on the type, the importance of the genetic material concerned and whether the affected cells are germ-track cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells are hereditary, and other mutations can cause cells to die or cause cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who like to visit nature reserves because they want to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
On the ground one can hunt, fish, photograph, observe birds, go to parks and study the ecosystem.
An example is a visit to, photographing and learning about the orangutangs in Borneo.
Every morning people from small villages go to their workplace by car and pass people whose workplace is located in the village where they just came from.
Everyone in this dynamic transport shuttle is somehow in contact with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows that because of this huge carbon economy, the biosphere is no longer in the stable state, allowing human evolution to take place over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, problems with water quality or collapsing bridges are rare in comparison.
How is it that there are so many complaints in transport systems, why does it go wrong every day? Are transport technicians simply incompetent? Or is it something more fundamental?
A traffic flow will look at the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between individuals.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to investigate the traffic flow, because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave fairly predictablely, which means that traffic flows show some degree of consistency and that there is something to be said about this in the mathematical field.
Links have been established between the three core characteristics to better reflect traffic resolution: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
With the help of these relationships, the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure is facilitated.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Thanks to their ability to fly, they were easier to escape from enemies and find more efficient food and mating partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to hide from predators in a larger number of small places.
At present only dragonflies and Mayflies cannot fold their wings.
A few thousand years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
There were people who thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the Earth, and so did the Sun (and other stars).
This makes sense, because you don't feel the earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the world's largest and second longest river and carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth and has a width of six miles in some places.
At least 20% of all the water flowing through the rivers into the sea comes from the Amazon.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 kilometres (3,980 miles) long. The water comes from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although building stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Empire, the pyramids of Giza remain unsurpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of the construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the new kingdom admired the monument of their predecessors, which was already over a thousand years old.
There are about 800 inhabitants in Vatican City, the smallest independent country in the world and also the lowest population.
Italian is the language used for the official communication and laws of the Vatican City State.
Italian is the language most spoken by the people who work there, while Latin is widely used during religious ceremonies.
Everyone living in Vatican City is Roman Catholic.
People know the most basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper from ancient times, because they are all found in nature and it is quite easy to mingle them with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle speculated that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like what we know of the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but he also theorized that they move into new substances to form into what we see.
Alloys are simply a combination of at least metals. As you know, the periodic table contains many elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are among the metals. Of course there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys may also contain a small amount of non-metal elements, for example carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion atoms fit into the tip at the end of this sentence.
That's why the pencil was a loyal friend to many people when it was launched.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pen has been reduced in status and is used much less.
Nowadays they write messages on a computer screen without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
You might wonder what's gonna happen to the keyboard as soon as something new comes on the market.
The atom bomb works according to the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and if the core is split again, part of the energy is released.
Some atoms have an unstable nucleus, which means that they fall apart at least at the slightest.
The surface of the moon is characterized by dust and rock. The crust is the outer layer of the moon.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the nearest side and 100 km thick on the other side.
The crust is thinner under the maria and thicker under the plateaus.
There are probably more buts on the side, because the crust is thinner there. Lava could easily come to the surface there.
Content theories are aimed at finding out what moves people and what appeals to them.
This theory suggests that people have certain needs and/or wishes that are internalized as they grow up.
With these theories they want to investigate the reasons why certain people want certain things and what environmental factors they influence to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the need pyramid of Maslow and the Motivation-Hygiene theory of Hertzberg.
In general, two practices emerge when managers take charge of their former colleagues and try to be equal in one course of action.
This type of manager finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions and disciplinary measures, conduct evaluation interviews, delegate and address people on their responsibilities.
On the other side of the spectrum it transforms into an unrecognizable individual. He or she gets the feeling that he or she needs to change everything that the team has done so far, and wants to own everything.
In the end, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
Often this behaviour leads to a gap between the leaders and the team members.
Virtual teams must meet the same standards of excellence as normal teams, although there are small differences.
In most cases, virtual team members are the first contact point for their direct physical group.
Often they are more independent than traditional team members, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The idea of a truly 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, pp 109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
The 'invisible team' is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team also sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organisation want to start the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation? One of the goals for putting organisational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity come to light when all available resources are used effectively within the functional departments of an organisation.
The result is that the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
In order to enable innovation in an organisation, management should stimulate a culture in which innovation, shared knowledge and organisational learning are central.
According to Angel (2006), organisations can perform better with an approach based on the continuum model.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to investigating cognition, reducing the scope of the study and allowing more accurate data to be collected.
The correlation between the pathology of the brain and behavior helps scientists during their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, wounds and tumors can affect behavior and lead to changes in mental capacity.
As there are more and more new technologies, we learn more and more about the structures and processes in the brain.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to develop simulation models that give us more insight into the processes of our mind.
AI reminds most people immediately of science fiction, but it is also an essential part of computer science. It is used in research into machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
The development of machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior is covered by research on AI.
Some examples include management, planning, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions and recognition of handwriting, voice and face.
These have become separate disciplines for finding solutions to problems in real life.
Today, this artificial intelligence system is widely used in economic, medical, technical and military fields, such as in various PC and video games software applications.
A lot of excursions are planned for each class. Often a teacher would take her students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Thanks to technological developments, virtual excursions are now possible, allowing students from the classroom to view the artifacts in a museum, look inside an aquarium or see beautiful works of art.
Virtually sharing an excursion is also a fantastic way to look back on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, which is redesigned every year and whose previous versions are kept online to serve as scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students write better. Often their grammar and spelling are still bad at first, but this changes quickly because they have an audience.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blogger strives to improve writing and thus avoid criticism.
By blogging ' students are also forced to learn more about the world around them'. The need to keep the public interested inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
In good use, blogs can help students to develop analytically and think critically; by actively engaging in the discussion on the Internet, students can find their own place in the context of other people's material and at the same time determine their own position on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The bilingual capital of Canada is the charming Ottawa, full of art galleries and museums in which Canada is exhibited in the past and the future.
Further south you will find the Niagara waterfalls. In the north you will find the beautiful unspoilt Muskoka and more.
This kind of thing makes Ontario in the eyes of outsiders typically Canadian.
Further north, large areas are fairly sparsely populated and some of these areas are virtually uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that will surprise many: there are more African-Americans living in the United States than the total population of Canada.
The East African islands are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and in the field of fauna it is almost a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands consist of independent countries or are connected to France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also took Islamic faith with them, and then spread widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the cape route from Europe to India, which marked the beginning of European influence and colonisation in the 15th century.
The region borders south and west of the Atlantic Ocean and north of the Sahel region.
Women: Women travelers are advised to say that they are married, whether or not they are.
It also helps to do rings (not too pricey looking rings).
Women must take into account that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they see as intimidating and that it is common to be followed, to be caught by the arm, etc.
Be clear when you reject a man and don't be afraid to stand up (cultural differences don't talk this right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. It was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meriniden and was known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the port and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca. After an earthquake in 1755 they left the city again.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city and called it Darfur-Bayad. The Spanish merchants who established their trading base here gave it the name Casablanca.
In Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop.
Around the old Medina you will find many places where you can buy traditional Moroccan stuff, such as tagines, pots, leather products, water pipes and other things, but it is purely aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It is located near Rwanda, in the extreme east.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the spitting of the Nyiragongo volcano lava and most of the streets of the city, especially the city centre, were buried.
Although Goma itself is relatively safe, for visits outside Goma you must check the state of play regarding the fighting going on in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city is the starting point for the ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano and you will find some of the cheapest trips for Mountain Gorilla tracking in Africa.
With boda-boda (a motor taxi) you can move on Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for the short ride.
'Timbouktu' is relatively poorly accessible and is therefore now used as a metaphor for exotic, distant countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although the city's reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites due to desert storms.
It was one of the most important stops of the PBS exhibition Special wonders from the African world of Henry Louis Gates.
The city differs from the other cities in the country, because it has a more Arabic look than an African.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs to the east along the border with Mozambique, to the north along the border with Zimbabwe and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
19,500 square kilometres is the park, divided into 14 different eco-zones, where various wild species are kept.
As an important attraction in South Africa, this park is the parade of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, daily conservation fees and entry fees apply.
It can also be useful to buy a Wild Card. These offer or access to certain parts of parks in South Africa or to all national parks in South Africa.
The whole territory of Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, which is considered by many tourists to be the most important place.
The large number of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has already been compared to a shimmering bar chart that is visible thanks to the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong you leave the island and head towards the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
The vast majority of the population of the island of Hong Kong lives very closely together on won land along the northern coast.
This is where the British settlers have settled, so if you're looking for proof of the colonial past of the area, then you can get off to a good start here.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forests in the world and stretch from the coast 80 km (50 miles) to the Indian and Bengal inland.
The Sundarbans are now officially listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The area within the Indian borders is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are more than just mangrove swamps - they also have some of the last mighty pieces of jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a third is peat and swamp area.
The Sundarbans have been a wildlife reserve since 1966 and are now estimated to be 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 axis deer.
During the day, buses depart from the station on the border of the districts (in front of the river). Most leave between 6.30am and 7.30pm, especially in the direction of the east and Jakar/Bumthang.
It is wise to buy a ticket a few days earlier, because the local buses are often fully booked.
In most neighbourhoods, small Japanese Coaster buses are comfortable and robust.
With shared taxis one can travel quickly and comfortably to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrum) and Punakha (200 ngultrum).
The Oyapock bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the Brazilian city of Oiapoque and the French-Guyanese city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters. The building has a length of 378 meters and has two passageways with a width of 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge is the crossing height 15 meters. In August 2011 the construction of the bridge was completed, but it only opened for traffic in March 2017.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that Brazilian customs posts will be ready for use.
The Guaraní was the most striking indigenous group. They lived in the area that is now Eastern Paraguay, lived as semi-nomadic hunters and also did self-sufficient agriculture.
In the province of Chaco other indigenous tribes lived, including the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who found their food by hunting, fishing and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as 'the great province of India', originated in the 16th century when Spanish settlers encountered the indigenous population.
There followed a three-century colonisation period among the Spaniards.
Asunción was founded in 1537 and since then Paraguay has preserved much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
There are also smaller tournaments and matches here at other times in the year.
Check the Asociación Argentina de Polo for more information about tournaments and buying tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP). The value is about one British pound (GBP).
On the islands there is only one bank, namely in Stanley opposite the FIC West store. Here you can exchange money.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands and in Stanley you can also often pay with credit cards and US dollars.
In the remote islands you probably can't pay by credit card, but probably with the British and American currencies. Ask the owners in advance how you can pay.
Change your money again before you leave the islands, because Falkland currency is very difficult to exchange outside.
Montevideo is below the equator, so when it's summer there, winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months temperatures are more than +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: the temperature is almost never below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
The rain level remains about the same throughout the year, without recognizable 'wet' and 'dry' periods.
Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, but wild animals are eventually just wild. Therefore, they should not be fed or disturbed.
Keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves in the park, and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
Elk, bison, reindeer, bears and about all other large animals can attack you, no matter how tame they seem.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking fragrant food and keep the camping spot clean.
The capital of Samoa is Apia and the city with almost 40,000 inhabitants is on the island of Upolu.
Around the year 1850 Apia was founded and it is the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the US and Great Britain did not want to leave the port, which later became known as the notorious stalemate.
With the exception of a British battleship, all ships were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence by the Mau movement, the highest leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, came to a non-violent gathering in the city.
There are many beaches, especially because of the two ports of Auckland. The most popular are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore in the North Harbour district stretch from north to south along the Pacific Ocean, from Long Bay to Devonport.
These are almost all sandy beaches where you can swim safely and most have pohutukawa trees that offer shade.
At Waitemata's harbour, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, located in Central Auckland, you will find the Tamaki Drive beaches.
These family beaches are sometimes crowded and have a good range of shops on the coast. Swimming is not unsafe.
'Number One' is the most important local beer that is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer has the name 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to be found, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better suited for travel.
The local drinking water can simply be drunk safely, but bottled water is also easy to find if you don't trust it.
A 'flat white' is a strange concept for Australians. Black coffee is 'espresso', cappuccino has a lot of coffee milk (without foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is of Belgian quality. Fruit juices are expensive, but great.
There are trips to the reef all year round and injuries to these trips to the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, ask for expert advice and follow all signs and safety warnings.
Cube jellyfish occur from October to April near beaches and estuaries north of Town or 1770. Sometimes they occur outside this period.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack people. Most of the sharks are afraid of people and would just swim away.
The main habitat of saltwater crocodiles is located in the estuaries north of Rockhampton and they do not normally live in the ocean.
Pre-booking ensures peace of mind with the traveller, knowing that he has a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have deals with certain hotels, although you can usually book other accommodation forms via a travel agency, such as a campsite.
Travel agencies often offer packages with breakfast and transport to and from the airport and sometimes even packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you want to think a little longer about the offer or if you need to acquire documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have a request or want to make a change, you must do so via the travel agency instead of the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of people present at music festivals choose to camp on the spot and most visitors see this as an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should be early to get a camping spot near the music.
And remember the following: even when the music on the main stages is over, other parts of the festival grounds may be played until the late hours of music.
For families whose children are still young, there are special campsites at some festivals.
Be careful where your cabin is when you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, because the journey through the ice makes a huge noise. if you are too close.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time to explore the city. Passengers of the cruise are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make the most of the time and money guests spend. Windows and clocks are normally not present and the exit is sometimes hard to find.
They usually have special offers in terms of food, drink and entertainment to keep them in a good mood and to prevent them from leaving.
Some locations offer free alcoholic drinks. However, when people are drunk, that affects their judgment and all seasoned gamblers know that it is extremely important to stay sober.
If you go up into the mountains or drive over mountain passes, you have to take into account that there can be snow or ice and the temperature can be extremely low.
On icy and snowy roads there is little friction and it drives different than asphalt.
During snowstorm, there can be enough snow falling in a very short period of time to get stuck.
It may also be obstructed by falling or rising snow or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries and do not hinder traffic.
The largest tourist African attraction are safaris, which are the highlight of their journey for many visitors.
The concept of safari refers in popular use to land travel to see the beautiful African wild animals, especially on the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars and standard equipment makes a good view possible.
If you want to see lions, cheetahs and leopards, you're gonna need binoculars, otherwise you're unlikely to see them.
A walking safari (also called a 'forest walk' or 'loopsafari') means that you walk several hours or days in a row.
The Paralympics are from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some parts are played in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city where the Olympic Games took place twice. The first time was in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodation before the delay was announced before 2020, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation policy varies, but from the end of March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies are no longer valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
Most of the tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥ 2,500 and ¥ 130,000. Regular tickets cost around ¥ 7,000.
You can dry wet clothes by ironing them. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available. You can often borrow these things even if they are not in the room.
If there is no iron available or if you do not want to wear ironed socks, you can also use a hair dryer if available.
Make sure that the substance does not get too hot (this may cause the substance to shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
You can purify water in different ways. Some ways are effective to combat specific risks.
In some areas it is sufficient to boil water for a minute, in others water needs to be boiled for a few minutes.
Not every filter is equally effective. In case of doubt you can best drink water from a sealed bottle of a reliable company.
Travellers can face animal plagues that are not there in their own country.
Pests can corrupt food, cause irritation or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison or transmit infections.
Normally infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that violently injure or kill people, are not considered pests.
Tax-free shopping means that you can buy goods that are exempt from tax and excise duties at certain locations.
Travellers who go to countries with high excise duties can sometimes save a considerable amount of money when it comes to products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
Point Marion and Fairmont are connected via the highway from Buffalo to Pittsburgh, you often drive through abandoned terrain and that makes this route one big challenge.
Are you not used to riding on country roads? Then keep your head to it. You come across a lot of steep slopes, narrow streets and sharp turns.
The maximum speeds set are remarkably lower than in previous and consecutive areas - usually about 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important to stick to them than usual.
Surprisingly, you have much more range here than in other corners of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries taste fine and in Bavaria the pastries are quite rich and varied, just like the pastries of the southern neighbor, Austria.
You can see many fruit pastries. All year round the cakes contain apples, and in the summer months also cherries and plums.
Many popular German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and taste fine with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but powerful pastries, try some that are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen region.

Racing brackets support the rider's feet and hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but can also cause safety problems because the feet of a rider can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse but hangs with the foot in the stirrup, they can be dragged with the horse. To reduce the risk, a number of safety measures have been taken.
Most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety brackets. This can release a stirrup from the saddle if this is pulled backwards because a rider falls off the horse.

Skiing is a popular travel activity with many lovers, who are sometimes called 'ski bums', who plan whole holidays around skiing in a certain location.
Skiing has been around for a very long time: there are cave paintings of skiers dating from 5000 BC!
The beginning of skiing dates from at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first recreational resort in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Backpacking with skis: this activity is also called off-piste skiing, ski touring or ski hiking.
It's not quite the same, but it looks like alpine skiing or mountain climbing, which is done a lot on steep terrain. You need a lot of sturdy skis and boots for this.
You can see the ski route as a walking route.
In good conditions you can travel longer distances than walking, but it happens rarely that on landscaped slopes you can reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Normally, travellers between different countries have to apply for visas and undergo passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions almost as one country in this area.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross the border without having to undergo another passport check.
When you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each Schengen country individually, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition to indicate which articles are produced antiques. Some tax offices give goods older than 100 years the antiques definition.

It is possible to label craft products as antiques, even though they are newer than comparable mass products.
Among the Sámi, the maintenance of reindeer is an important form of livelihood. Also, the culture surrounding trade is very important for many with other professions.
However, not all Sámi were traditionally involved in large-scale reindeer farming, and they were involved in fishing, hunting and similar activities, usually using reindeer as migratory animals.

Severe weather is the general term for any dangerous weather event that can lead to damage, serious social disruption or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world. There are different types of weather conditions, which vary according to geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Signs and consequences of heavy weather are for example hard wind, hail, large amounts of precipitation and forest fires, but also thunderstorms, tornadoes, water coughs and hurricanes.
Snowstorms, ice storms and dust storms include examples of regional and seasonal extreme weather phenomena.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks associated with severe weather conditions in their environment, as they may also affect some travel plans.
Anyone who wishes to visit a country considered a war zone should be trained professionally.
A search for 'course in hostile environments' on the internet probably gives the address of a local company.
In a course, all the issues set out here are normally dealt with in more detail, usually in conjunction with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and consists of role games, lots of first aid and occasional weapons training.
There are many books and magazines with articles about survival in the wilderness. However, there are few publications about war zones.
Travellers who have planned a sex operation abroad should ensure that they have the appropriate documentation for the return journey.
It varies widely whether governments want to issue passports that do not include a gender (X) or to update a name or gender on documents.

In addition, investigations into security controls have become much more extensive since 11 September 2001.
Transgender individuals who have not yet undergone surgery can assume that they will not pass through this scan with unharmed privacy and dignity.
Muid currents are the recurring flow of waves that break on a reef or something similar and flow on the beach.
Due to underwater topology, the return flow is located in some deeper parts, where a rapid flow to deep water can occur.
Most deaths are due to fatigue by trying to swim against the current. This could be impossible.
Once you've escaped the strong current, it'll be swim back in no time.
Try to focus on a place where you won't get grabbed again. Depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you can also wait for help.
The shock of returning is worse than the culture shock (you have a less big 'marriage feeling'), it takes longer, and it can be more intense.
Travellers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes find it difficult to adapt to their own culture.
If you have lived abroad and then returned, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your own culture.
When you went abroad, you noticed that people were patient and understanding, because they understood that travellers had to adapt in a new country.
Usually it is not expected that patience and understanding is needed for travellers returning home.
For children, the pyramid show with light and sound is one of the most interesting activities in the area.
You see the pyramids in the dark and you see them in silence before the show starts.

The Sphinx forms the background and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes appear as projection on the pyramids and the rest of the pyramids are highlighted.
The Southern Shetland Islands were discovered in 1819 and have since been claimed by several countries. They have most of the bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is the King George island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others are Livingston Island, and Deception. Here you will find the flooded crater of an active volcano that serves as a spectacular natural port.
Ellsworth is located on the southern side of the peninsula, at the border with the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula pass into the plateau, then they come out again to form the 360 km long mountain range Mount Ellsworth, which is crossed by the Minnesota tagletjer.
The northern part, also known as the Sentinel Range, includes the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif. Mount Vinson is the highest mountain with 4892 meters.
A satellite phone can be your only option in remote locations where there is no cell phone reception.
A satellite phone is not really a substitute for a mobile phone, as you have to be outside with a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.

Finland is a fantastic destination for sailing. The 'Land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of islands, in the lakes and in the islands off the coast.
A yacht is not necessary for the archipelagos or lakes.
The archipelagos on the coast and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for every yacht, but with smaller boats or even a kayak you get a completely different experience.
In Finland so many people sail in their spare time, that the ratio of boats to people is one in seven or eight.
The figure is equal to the figure of Norway, Sweden and New Zealand. Furthermore, it is quite unique (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one in forty).
Most Baltic cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg (Russia).
So you can spend a few full days in the historic place and stay on the ship.
Since 2009 you do not need a separate visa if you only go ashore during a boat excursion.
Some cruises include a visit to the German capital Berlin, but as you can see on the map Berlin is not close to the sea. A visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be scary for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or if they have had a traumatic experience.
It's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different than many fears that other people have.
If you know how planes work, this can help to remove a fear that arises from the unknown or from the fact that you have no control over the plane.
Courier companies receive a generous fee to deliver items quickly. Time often plays a very important role for business documents, merchandise or spare parts for a necessary repair.
Larger companies could use their own aircraft for certain routes, but for other routes and smaller companies it became more difficult.
If they send things by air, it may take days on some routes to unload and pass through customs.
Only as checked-in baggage could it be processed more quickly. According to the rules of airlines, there must be a corresponding passenger and so you are.
The most obvious way to fly in first or business class is by counting down a bag of money for this privilege (or even better, by having your employer do this).
However, this is not cheap: the rule of thumb is that you pay about four times economy class for business, and about eleven times for first class.
There is usually no point in looking for discounts for business class or first-class tickets on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of kites who are willing to pay a lot of money to fly somewhere fast and comfortable, and therefore the airlines charge corresponding costs.
Chişinău is the Moldovan capital. Here the Romanian language is mainly spoken, but also the Russian language is common.

The hard exterior of the Parisians quickly disappears when you show that you are familiar with their way of doing things.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded and this wooded area consists mainly of beech, spruce and pine, and includes a combination of alpine and Mediterranean flora.

On the other hand, men should wear trousers at least over their knees.
You can also borrow it from the stock at the entrance, but these clothes are not washed every time, so you may not feel comfortable with it. One size fits all for men!

But people who speak a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is so similar that you don't have to learn it separately.
Premodern observatories are now obsolete, and serve as museums or educational sights.
Light pollution was not as big a problem as it was today, so they were often built in cities or campuses, better accessible than today.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities built in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Hanami is witnessing cherry blossoms and this has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
In China, plum blossoms were the favourite flowers and that's where the concept came from.
The first cherry blossom feasts of Japan were organized by the emperor and were only intended for himself and other aristocrats at the imperial court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so you have to suppress the tendency to remove even 'only one' species.

Moreover, people who do not believe in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world have adopted many traditions that are part of the holiday.
There is a tradition where you stay up all Easter until you can see the sunrise at some point.
Of course there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may as well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
In traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend. The congregations often celebrate a feast in honor of the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally arrived at the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent it was not possible for mammals to make the journey. As a result, the giant turtle became the most common grazing mammal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since man set foot on the Galapagos, all kinds of mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
During the winter, the Arctic and Antarctic region have a polar night, which means that the sun doesn't actually rise.
