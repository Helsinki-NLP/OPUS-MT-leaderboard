Four members of the Kemerovo Group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to Postimees, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the so-called leader of the Kemerovo Group, operating in the Estonian Underworld, known as Slava Kemerovsky in the criminal world.
Gulevich, arrested in Spain, was arrested with the permission of the court.
Yesterday, three suspects detained in Estonia were also arrested by the court.
It is suspected that it is members of a so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation, aged 27 to 57, who commit mainly drug-related crimes.
In the province of Malaga, Mijas, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained.
Three men were detained as a suspect in Estonia, one of whom has been reported to be the leader of a criminal organisation and two to be members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected indicate that the criminal organisation had a clear division of functions and roles.
The purpose of the criminal organisation's activities was to commit drug offences and thereby to earn the proceeds of crime," commented the head of the pre-trial proceedings in criminal cases, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out an increase in the number of suspects in this case," added the prosecutor.
These are people who have been involved in law enforcement activities in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug crimes.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues had been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become the norm for us, and this week's operation shows the success of the cooperation," commented Public Prosecutor Verte.
Ago Leis, Head of the Central Criminal Police Service, said that detentions were preceded by a pre-trial investigation lasting almost one and a half years.
"In the first half of the week, the long-term work was realised and we were simultaneously apprehending suspicions of crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
Leis added that the officials of the Central Criminal Police were helping with detention in Spain.
For years, we have had good contact and mutual understanding with the Spanish police and the civilian guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can catch them from the other end of Europe," said Leis.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that men who were suspected of being at large may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecutor's office has requested their arrest and the court has approved it.
A man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
Property, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation in the context of this criminal case.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Office for Organised Crimes organised by the Central Criminal Police and run by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The Tallinn City Court convicted Slava Gulevich of extortion in 2005 and sentenced him to five years in jail.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevich was considered the second most important man in the Estonian criminal world after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevitch, from Kemerovo, emerged in the Estonian underworld in the early 1990s when he began blackmailing in Tallinn.
He allegedly taxed taxi drivers and prostitutes from various hotels and charged businessmen monthly roofing taxes.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and final judgments confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the last judgments, the eight accused persons who were separated from the criminal case of the so-called Dikayev criminal organisation, who seized EUR 80 000 of the proceeds of crime, or the judgment against nine persons in the fact that Igor Aleynikov established in 2006 a criminal organisation aimed at the illicit trafficking of salasigarets and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in Ida-Viru County and South Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds seized is nearly EUR 71 500.
The success of these criminal cases has been ensured by the daily exchange of information and evidence by police officers with foreign colleagues and, if necessary, with operations in any country in the European Union.
Citizen Rights Group warns against traveling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned black people travelling to Missouri about discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The Group statement states: "The NAACP travel note issued for the state of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the state, given the number of suspicious race-based events that have recently taken place across the state and are also highlighted here."
According to NAACP, the group was urged to issue a travel warning, both the recent Missouri Act, which makes it more difficult to win cases concerning discrimination, and the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are, to an unequal extent, minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the NAACP Missouri branch Rod Chapel to The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received complaints so closely before."
This is the first warning the organization has issued about the state of the United States.
The group referred to events such as racist insults against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of the 28-year-old black Toy Sanders from Tennessee.
Sanders died at the beginning of this year under dubious circumstances after he ran out of gas while driving through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to a recent report by the Prosecutor General of Missouri, which shows that in the state, cars of black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped than those of whites.
"The note is designed to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People have to be ready, whether it means taking bail money or informing relatives that they're going through the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, placing the state in 16th place in the country's cross-section in terms of the number of similar violations.
The travel warning is also in response to Missouri's new law, which makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU had previously issued travel notes about Texas and Arizona following the adoption by these states of immigration laws that obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as according to ACLU it increases racial profiling.
Usually, travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have started to use this measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Hepatitis: What can anyone know about different forms of this severe disease?
Hepatitis (inflammation of the liver) can be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All these viruses induce acute inflammation of liver tissue.
However, chronic hepatitis B and C, which can develop into cirrhosis of the liver, known as hepatic wrinkle and liver cancer, have a poor course.
Health Board Epidemiology Advisor Kuulo Kutsar says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of liver inflammation - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, grey stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease also comes from a common name called jaundice.
In children, hepatitis may develop without signs or symptoms.
The different types of inflammation of the liver can only be determined from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis can become chronic hepatitis and progress for decades without signs of disease, which means that a person may not know anything about his or her dangerous disease affecting the liver.
Kuulo Kutsar outlines different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in greater detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from a sick person and infect us when eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from the infected person's stool to the hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, mouth, and drug use.
The risk groups for hepatitis A infection include members of the family and carers of the affected, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug users, travelers to countries with high prevalence of hepatitis A.
Infections can be prevented by vaccinations, in particular for people travelling a lot and at risk of hepatitis A vaccination is recommended.
In addition, it is important to meet daily hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before food intake.
Hepatitis B viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items (brushes, shaving devices), donor blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis, and by a mother with hepatitis to the foetus/newborn.
Drug users at risk for hepatitis B infection, sex partners of the infected person, men having sex with men, newborn babies of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, and travelers to highly affected countries of hepatitis B infection.
It is possible to vaccinate people for the prevention of hepatitis B infection; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as persons with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of sanitary and manicure equipment, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing of strangers, and the use of condoms for potentially contagious sex, or preventing sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses are transmitted by contact with the blood of a sick person, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated household items, donating blood, having sex with a person suspected of having hepatitis and having hepatitis from the mother to the fetus/newborn.
Among the risk groups for hepatitis C infection are injecting drug users, infected human sex partners, men having sex with men, newborns of the infected mother, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, HIV-infected persons and travellers visiting highly ill countries of hepatitis C.
The prevention measures for hepatitis C include: avoiding the use of sanitary and manicure equipment for strangers, other sharps and needles, tattooing and piercing, and the use of condoms for potentially contagious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by hepatitis D virus, which reproduces in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
As a result, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are transmitted by contact with blood and other body fluids, with contaminated syringes and needles, sexually and rarely from the infected mother to the foetus.
Chronic hepatitis B carriers and non-hepatitis B immunocompromised people are at risk for hepatitis D.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against hepatitis D virus infection.
Hepatitis E viruses spread via faeces via drinking water and food, including low-heated beef, fish and clams, donor blood, common syringes and infected mother to foetus.
Passengers may be infected with hepatitis E in countries with high disease.
Preventive measures for hepatitis E include meeting hygiene requirements: wash or disinfect hands after using the toilet, before preparing and eating, after treating the patient.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating low-heated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
While on the last round, competitors tried to push the four-time Olympic winner off the track, 34-year-old Farah found strength in the final leg and won 26.49.51 in time.
Farah did not think long, dragging her husband Tania and children along after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
It was wonderful being on the track with them," said Farah to the journalists.
Farah targets the fifth title competition in London in a row 5,000 and 10,000 metres of gold.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "The Lady in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the extraordinary story of Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait" dives far deeper than the birth of a work of art into the cultural life of Vienna at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more deeply into history.
An awe - inspiring amount of information could have been used, i.e. a louder death axe, a narrower topic would have allowed the extraordinary story of the title to become more effective.
It is now like two books between one cover: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer in Gustav Klimt and his painting Lady in Gold, and a much larger and more comprehensive history book about respectable Jewish families and the German occupation, with its repercussions in Austria.
The first third of the book leads to the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of the bubbling, and who himself ended up in the capital of Austria, can easily imagine how life was going around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago or how everything turned their heads in the Central Cafe when Klimt came in.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and you feel like a gram of culture in the book.
At the same time, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a town where there was an incurable syphilis and the highest level of suicide in Europe, as if there was nothing more to the development of the story.
Or perhaps - each pair of strokes adds colors to the cultural life in Vienna at the beginning of the 20th century.
A dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews in Vienna had exploded, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
At the turn of the century, almost one in ten people in Vienna were Jewish.
Adele's parents were also newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married her twice to open up to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and Klimt posed for her famous paintings, her father's bank had become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adelet didn't smoke the whole glamorous life he belonged to.
When you look at "Dami in Gold," it's hard to believe that at the end of life this great lady was infected with socialism and dreamed of traveling to the Soviet Union.
By 1903 when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his wife's portrait from Klimt, he was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt's order cost 4,000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a good cottage.
The fact that some portraits were suspected of the master's love affair with a model didn't discourage the sugar magnate.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only certain fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist that emerged during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "The Lady in Gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, the portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer," Varrak 2016, translated from English by Aldo Randmaa.
Just before the work started with Adele, Klimt had been to Ravenna in San Vitale's basilica, and researchers believe that the brilliant mosaics seen there gave Empress Theodora the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adèle as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Dami in Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and at about the same time (1907-1908), another golden painting "Kissus" was born.
Artistic historians did not overlook the similarity of two women.
What does Hitler have to do with the story?
"I think, in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) to the director of the Belvedere Museum and wished that their family's collection of Klimt would go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had a second portrait of Adèle.
Also in his will (Adele left in February 1925), he asked his wife to leave his two portraits and four landscape paintings of Gustav Klimt to the Austrian Gallery.
Her jewelry was passed on to her nieces Maria and Luis.
A year after Klimt had graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, 17-year-old Adolf Hitler had tried to enter the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, but he failed to draw.
Although Hitler's later anti-Semitism is sometimes considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him to the academy, none of his examiners were really Jewish.
In any case, the role of the Austrian Gallery, referred to in Maria's will, had changed considerably by 1939 - finding works that were pleasing to the Nazi party from the rich Jewish collections in Vienna had become important.
Hitler's personal art store was also suitable for some of Adele's homework, but not for Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robberies began a ten-year dispute between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauers.
It should be noted here that if "Kissus" is seen in Belvedere Castle in Vienna, then Adele Bloch-Bauer's "Dami in Gold" must be visited by Neue Galerie of New York.
And before the Vienna race, read the above book.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, at least my emotions revolved around more Nazi and Jewish issues after the book was closed than the 135 million dollar painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait as a story of the fate of a family - and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree, mentioned at the beginning of the book, made it noticeably easier to orientate.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
In pre-swimming, Gold was very close to the personal record of his 200 metres of back swimming 2.16,62.
The top brand dates from a 17-year-old girl a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championship became 2.16,58, Priit mediates Aavik's Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to make it to the A-Final.
In the finals, he passed a distance of 2.15.76 and gained a good seventh place with a powerful new top stamp.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15,13) left Gold for just over half a second.
Gold rose to third in Estonia's all-time ranking, and his new personal top mark is the fifth result of all-time Estonia.
The young hope for the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championship 100 m, 200 m and 400 m in free swimming and 200 m and 400 m in complex swimming.
Last week the Canadian Junior Championship was held in Toronto, and Gold made successful launches there too.
He won a 200 meter free-swimming silver medal in 2.03.22.
So quickly it was watered by an Estonian woman last year in 2008.
Only the Estonian record woman Elina Partäästa has flown this distance faster than Gold in Estonia.
The Estonian woman living in Canada won the bronze medal with a great personal record and a new Estonian season's top stamp 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than him, has only swam this distance one century faster.
He reached the top of his personal stamp in a 100-mile back swimming session and received a message-swimming opening exchange of time 1.03,69.
At half the distance, he only reached seventh place when he swam to the finals at 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season ranking at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen their teeth.
It's vacation time - that means relaxing for President Donald Trump of the United States.
However, since Trump has been one of the president's most holiday days so far, critics are sharpening their teeth.
According to USA Today and CNN, the president is planning a 17-day holiday at a golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey.
Although the President's vacation began yesterday, Trump's opponents have been speaking about the holiday for a week.
They blame Trump for too much rest.
It is the President's custom to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
For example, George W. Bush had been on vacation for 67 days, but Barack Obama was half as short as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump has a tendency to forget things quickly.
The days after he became president, Trump said on the show "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during his term of office, because there is a great deal to be done.
Three years ago, he also expressed resentment for Barack Obama's vacation.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "As Obama is on vacation, playing golf, going to parties and jazz concerts, ISIS will cut off the heads of journalists."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
Instead, it is officially called work leave, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other favorite activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working leave.
The air conditioning system in the west wing of the White House was replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave.
The Oval Office and other Presidential premises are also located in the west wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if it was 38 degrees and no air conditioner," said the White House speaker Lindsay Walters, who stressed that the president would continue to work on vacation.
Where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook does not apply for state office if you cannot stand the criticism of voters
The father of our country knew a lot about unfavorable media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but the newspapers didn't take long to beat him for everything from internal politics to political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't make his critics shut up.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech can be taken away from us and, in silence and in silence, we can be led into slaughter like sheep."
This brings me to the governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And by the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU brought him to court.
The governor's office stamped the action void, and the web commentaries were full of counter-reactions in the "Who cares?" style.
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But that does matter.
And it matters a lot when it comes to a man like Hogan.
It's an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His acceptance rate is the second highest among the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not an unthinking, reactive hothead.
He has led the state on a firm hand and has remained firmly determined to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook as a key tool in communicating with his constituents, for example, by presenting his bald head in a funny way for the first time since chemotherapy.
Thus, the Governor's page, which is a public forum with official labelling, is managed by the blocking of people visiting taxpayers' dollars, which is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
Hogan's spokesperson, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's behaviour in an interview with The Washington Post, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderation.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of online trolls, spam posters, or hate-filled people.
The Post had a conversation with several real people Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are real people who communicate with their elected leaders, the teacher, the owner of the company and the pastor, not the Internet trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful, and not dirty at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, emphasising Hogan's Catholicism.
A lawyer from Maryland, Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, didn't incite anger, he didn't instigate real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed because he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote in the commentary section of The Post News.
"I also do not like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it an indifferent collective effort rather than admitting that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's office called a "targeted spam attack," others would probably call "public support."
The Facebook age allows you to easily match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days when workers had to be sent out to do the same, to collect newspapers with critical editorials and to burn them or arrest protesters and to silence them.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for toothless Facebook and other social media channels.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter's users who are blocked from his Twitter feed.
One of the first judgments of symbolic significance on this subject was given last week in Virginia.
The U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris decided in Alexandria that the chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment of the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also visited ACLU Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
During Washington, affordable postal costs had similar effects to those of the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous writers beat his way of leading.
And even then Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to newspapers under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius, and Portius, destroying Washington's decisions.
According to historical documents collected in the framework of the project to collect letters from George Washington, his office was buried in petitions, which criticised his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Great Britain.
But he didn't shut them up.
Freedom of expression, dissent and debate are the foundations of our country.
And proper leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty is counting on the comfort of his home territory at the Renaissance Club.
Ronan Rafferty, a former European number, hopes for comfort in the home territory in the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the East Lothian Renaissance Club golf courses.
The Northerner, who was in charge of the last round of archerfield Links in the neighborhood last year before Paul Eales was brought down, is fond of the new venue and instead of Jerry Sarvad, the founder and CEO of the club, plays the role of the tournament ambassador.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built, and now we see the club shine in full glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"Players see the path in their best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry has done an excellent job of building this place.
He's an enthusiastic supporter of the golf game, and he's proud of what he's done here.
This allows you to present the track perfectly."
The Englishman Eles looks forward to defending the championship for the first time, even though he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"It's going to be a very special feeling," said the player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my title to Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the competition calendar a year after I won.
It's magic to come back to this neighborhood.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year, and for me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts."
Gary Orr, who joined the seniors' European tour towards the beginning of this year when he received 50, will return to the competition on the ground.
This is his first event in Scotland since his participation in Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It's always a little more meaningful to play at home," said Helensburgh's man Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel the extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again tremendously, and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I am satisfied with the progress made so far."
Ian Woosnam, former Masters tournament winner, Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will join the Trio.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on fire, the rest of whom are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and car parking costs 5 pounds per passenger and 10 pounds per car with two or more passengers.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Goldy Land
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
He rarely even uses a potty.
In a wooden cabin located in Enarotal, the capital of Paniai, a reluctant province of Papua, Indonesia, a housewife places a sweet potato called "nota" in the local language directly on the front of the fire.
Within half an hour, the charred tuber will be removed from the fire and the skin will be enthusiastically skinned with unwashed hands.
Degei sits on a muddy floor without furniture, and there he also does his daily chores, such as washing with cloudy water from a nearby sex.
The toilet role is filled by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he is the youngest of four wives of his wife, he is not assigned to care for any field.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous for most of the village's men are unemployed and many of them drink heavily, and there are soldiers.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock at night," he says.
This is a rare glimpse into the highlands of Papua. It is a former Dutch colony that was merged under Indonesia in 1969 after the controversial referendum, during which only 1026 old people were forced to vote in front of the troops of the occupying group.
The movement that has encouraged the Dutch to be freed from domination quickly turned its rage against Jakarta's government, which continues to hold the region under its strong control, avoiding foreign journalists and human rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that independent Papua New Guinea remained in the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is both remote and deserted in the same way. To arrive here you must fly from the capital of the province to Nabire for 90 minutes and then pass the five-hour journey to make the rental car nauseous.
There's no public transport.
A city with about 19,000 inhabitants is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs, the rust of which has turned different shades into yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesians have made their way here, let alone journalists, and there have been hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Paapua of Mee Pago worshiped a god called Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We weren't used to wearing clothes like this," says Degei, referring to his colorful, hand-woven turban, dark blouse and bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also a gold-rich country in Indonesia.
Only 100 km from Pania, a mountainous province of about 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, a company operating in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted around USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can be proud of the supply of commercial timber with an estimated value of USD 78 billion.
But these riches are the source of the papua's suffering, as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
A 2005 study in The New York Times showed that between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military and military units around USD 20 million, including up to USD 150 000 to an officer.
The Pope's efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are mercilessly handled.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, in the highlands belonging to Papua tribes, the mass killings in the 1970 ' s were a genocide.
Last year alone, over 3,900 peaceful protesters were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report by the archbishopric of Birsbane, "We are losing everything," contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as out-of-court executions, torture (as reported in another report, rape and electrocution) and brutal repression of peaceful protests.
"The number of victims is difficult to count because such incidents occur every week," says Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
Screws are even harder closed because Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing, as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the vast islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes in Indonesia.
The Japanese family canteens sell crisp chicken and gado-gado with mixed vegetables, which is served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local pops," explains the 24-year-old Abeth You, born in Pania, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province for work.
"Papawa mama [women] are therefore losing their market share'.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia, known to the people as Jokowi, promised to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua in his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter won 27 of the 29 electoral districts of Papua, including Paniai, on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted in favour of Jokowi in anticipation of fulfilling our hopes of restoring justice," says You.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi took office in October, Paniai was at a low point.
On December 7, 2014, 11 children in Enarotal sang Christmas songs by the fire when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle from the darkness.
Dreadful kids told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone of voice and later returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and eyewitnesses, drunk soldiers chased children and beat them with their gun handles.
Then one of the soldiers fired at the children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimot, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the nearby electoral council building was set on fire, and the next day things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women, and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting boats and performed a waita dance of the Paupua honey pago tribe, during which they ran around and mimiced the birds' song.
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
Upon aggravating resentment, an order was sent to the soldiers via internal radio. "If the mob resists more than three times, shoot them," they were told according to an official document that has been seen in the journal TIME but has not been issued to local media publications.
The elder in Kego Koto, Enarotal, Yeremias Kayame (56) sensed the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the crowd to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"I was suddenly shot in the left wrist by turning around," he said to the magazine TIME on the porch of a tree house in bright colors.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there was plenty of gunshots," he adds.
A local man named Alfius Youw was hit three times by a cousin who witnessed his shooting.
"I would run to him and examine his body to make sure it was him," said Time grimly Yohanes, who uses only one name like many Indonesians.
"I saw that he was dead... kissed him."
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of Papua Police told reporters that his subordinates only returned to the security of their department because it was attacked.
"We must defend ourselves if we are threatened to be killed," said Pudjo Sulistiyo, Commissioner of Papua Police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and heavily injured.
The news of the killings did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi Jayapura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses in Papua.
"I want to solve this case immediately so that it never happens again in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would put in place an out-of-court mechanism to deal with the crimes against human rights that have occurred.
But almost immediately, apologies followed.
"Most crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes," he said.
When speaking with TIME magazine in Jakarta on 5 June, however, Wiranto withdrew his words, saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism for dealing with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything is settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights involving the deaths of more than 1 000 people in East Timor during the 1999 bloody referendum on independence, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including what happened in Paniai.
The families of the victims of Paniai accepted such claims with grim distrust.
"I've been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed that the people of Paniai were afraid to dissect this incident.
He said he was beaten by the army after he helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot the villagers in Deiyai, a neighbour of Paniai.
One person was killed and 17 wounded, including children, during a struggle between the villagers and the construction company manager, who refused to transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, drowned in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company's office on the construction site.
According to the police, the villagers were throwing rocks at the police, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to locals, the mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
"We were in a great panic, we were afraid of revenge," said Time, 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the incarceration of the injured.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the prosecution of the police involved and the withdrawal of the mobile police brigade from the area.
Panai has always been a troubled place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, moni, dani, and damal tribes living in the greening middle mountain of Papua.
Many of them have joined the Resistance Army of the Free Papua Movement (VPL), which, according to it, defends the rights of the Papua, occasionally conducting attacks and abductions among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL are from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response to this, under the pretext of "protecting the sovereignty of the state," the army has in recent years arrested Paniais and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Panii is known as "a tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The few rice sold in Enarotal are too expensive to buy for the locals.
The bread is just as unattainable.
People grow all their food themselves mainly in sweet potatoes, plus some fruit and green vegetables.
Farming is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually store most of the crops for the family, the rest they sell on the local market.
Ten sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the paparazzi and the new migrants who have arrived a lot since the opening of the new routes at Nabire airport has widened.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and wealthier migrants.
The Papua themselves often lack the capital or the necessary skills to conduct a competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying, because there are no jobs or money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Segregation keeps the world's eyes off Papua.
In addition, severe restrictions remain on foreign media.
In the early part of this year French journalists Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow appropriate practices" even though they had been given a rare film authorisation.
According to Phelim Kine, Deputy Head of the Asian Department of Human Rights Watch, Jokow's election promises to remove the restrictions on reporters to promote transparency and development have not been implemented.
"New threats to journalists trying to report from Papua's most eastern restless provinces in Indonesia and West Papua threaten to reject visas and be blacklisted," he said in a statement.
The lack of media-creating eyes means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states were urged by Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands to investigate "various large-scale crimes" in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
The same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the group's accusations, saying to journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still democratic order and freedom of the press so that evidence of anti-human rights cases would be difficult to bury."
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation led the visit to Jayapura with the national human rights ambassador Kees Van Bar on 4 May, according to the source who was present but wanted to remain anonymous, local people interrupted their silence by urging: 'We want freedom'.
New presidential elections will take place in Indonesia in 2019, but the Papua do not believe that they will vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a well-meaning man, but surrounded by people involved in the shooting of Paniai," says Hobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to understand that, in addition to constantly living under threat from the predatory army, the people of Paniai are struggling with poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like the other Papua, view their vote given to Jokow as a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai's shooting victims were able to cope with the final symbolic rebellion they buried the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be established, at least they will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"One of our family members was killed," says Yacobus with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
On Friday, fire swooped through one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to escape from this 337-metre-high and 79-storey building.
It's another fire that's been ravaged in just two years by a high-tech giant called the Torch, or Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct cause of the fire was reported.
"We slept and woke up about the fire alarm and the shouting of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said Reuters to a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai's civil defence officials, firemen erased the flame around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may again raise questions about the safety of materials used around the world on the surface of buildings.
During the investigation of the Torch Board following the fire in 2015, it was found that the biggest damage was caused by facade panels - decorative panels and insulation of the outer surface.
British police have said that they believe that the isolation and facade panels of the Grenfell Tower in London could contribute to the rapid spread of the fire in June, which killed some 80 people.
Look, these phones are probably gonna be the hits in the fall.
Spring and autumn are sweet times for technology fans, because then phone manufacturers will disclose their new top models.
Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to the market in spring, and new hit phones are also expected for shops.
According to Kristjan Seema, marketing and sales director of Tele2, this year's flagships are characterised by innovative design, an ophthalmic scanner, a 4K resolution screen and an ultra fast processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 created great excitement in the world of technology, which has also reached the forefront of Estonian smartphone sales.
Autumn allows smart people to be even more fast-started, a more durable battery, a better-quality camera and greater water and dust security.
He added that according to the rumors, one can already make assumptions and predict the four top models that are likely to conquer the sales tables this year.
These four top models of smartphones will reach the shops in autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the stores in mid-September.
Rumors, however, about what the new Apple model looks like and what it can do will spread a lot.
While iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to be completely different from the previous ones.
Four colours have been spoken: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire front panel of the phone, the home button is lost and the fingerprint reader is built into the screen.
Apple Design Manager JonyIve insists that the new iPhone model looks like smooth glass.
There has also been talk about the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the ophthalmic scanner, wireless charging and even higher-quality camera, a faster A11 processor can be expected.
I'm sure it's one of the expected smartphones of the year.
The pre-ordering of the brand new Galaxy Note 8 model starts on 23 August.
There's been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is gonna look like.
It has been said that even more business users are targeted and that the S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower field of view.
No one yet knows what the two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable to iPhone 8.
But we look forward to August 23.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones with Nokia 6 this year, their flagship Nokia 8 is still missing, which will be presented on August 16.
We expect Nokia to have a 5.3-inch edge-to-side screen and a high-speed Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk of an aluminium body and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, Nokia's new model has two rear cameras, whose optics are produced by Zeiss.
If Sony's firm flagship has been XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that in the near future at least two smartphones will be added with even more innovative features.
We're waiting for a smartphone, which is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least as good or better with a camera.
For Sony's new model, it has been speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
What the reality brings, we will be able to see very soon, because Sony has traditionally published his autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
According to leaked transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post published transcripts of telephone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Mexican and Australian heads of state.
On January 27, Trump made a phone call to the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop declaring that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The American President scolded him for public condemnation of the wall, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump made his presidential campaign promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that he would make Mexico pay for this project.
The transcripts of his first speech with the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, were also published, revealing intense discussions.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States would take on refugees going to Australia was "criminal," "stupid" and "stupid." He claimed that an agreement made under the Obama Government would give him the impression of a "cupid," as he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees in the United States.
Trump hung up, telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Liinid in the case where the city of Tartu rejected their offer for the procurement of bus transport from July 2019 to 2029.
This is an order that rejected OÜ MRP Linna Liinid's bid for Tartu bus procurement, as the offer did not meet the requirements, explained Anneli Apuhtin, Head of the Tartu City Government Legal Service.
This is the procurement of public bus transport within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
The MRP Linna Lines complained to the Supreme Court about the decision of the Tartu District Court.
The Supreme Court did not take this matter into consideration.
Although many complain on social media that the noise from the Weekend festival disturbs their night's sleep and the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who have no bad words about the festival that lasts on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the store was so polite!
I didn't see any blurry or rudeness.
I even saw kindness," says the limey Wave.
"It is good to have come, to be and to enjoy Pärnu, which has remained in winter as winter sleep," he adds gladly.
The beach sounded like a wav doesn't interfere with the sleep of the Wave.
While living downtown, he heard music playing on the beach, now the music hasn't come to his home.
"But I hope I can hear," he says happily.
Agnes, who spoke with the Evening Festival, also says that the Grand Festival is rather good for Pärnu - it helps local merchants to make a good profit.
He also rejoices that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
The wife of a party girl doesn't bother you.
Even though I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's alive.
And it's nice that people are moving and it's been like this three times," she says.
I think it was a little worse the first time.
"There may have been complaints," he meditates.
According to him, it is common for the summer capitals to have a beach life.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who basks in the park.
Neither has Melu and the riots swayed his life's rhythm.
But for what?!
We should all stick together.
Think about how this interethnic communication would be better.
Loud music doesn't devastate a man.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live nearby.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," she says.
He says the guests who came to Pärnu are polite.
"They have, of course, exaggerated a little, but young people are young and Lord God - let go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
By then, the beach dwellers have traveled somewhere away, either to relatives or to acquaintances.
"But in general, the festival has a positive impact on life - people like it," says Tiina, who has walked with children in Pärnu.
His family's dream music is not disturbed either, although last year it came even further than this year.
Last summer the stage was the other way around, then we heard more.
We live outside the city, that it actually sounds pretty good on the far side of the Pärnu River," he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive the business.
The British educational company Pearson said on Friday that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce its mid-dividends by 72 percent, thus launching another restructuring programme to address the distress of business.
According to CEO John Fallon, the jobs to be lost are likely to increase to 4000 jobs lost in the course of the previous restructuring at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019.
Pearson announced in May a plan to cut the costs of the third cost reduction programme by another GBP 300 million (394 million US dollars) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner company Bertelsmann last month, said that their expectations regarding the year have not changed since a 1% increase in sales revenue was reported to GBP 2.05 billion in the first half of the year.

Convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
According to officials, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several of you.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the city's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the acts of violence that have hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat Mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber in Kabul killed two people near the Iraqi embassy.
NATO's statement said that a Thursday night explosion took place when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked with a "humanly worn self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, everyone is injured in a stable state and is being treated at Bagram Airport in the United States Military Hospital.
According to correspondents, the increasing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (ISIS) in Qarabagh is a serious source of concern for the forces in NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1,662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb in Kabul killed at least 30 people in the Shiite district.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On May 31st, more than 150 people were killed by a major bombing in the city centre - a military attack in the country that has led to the most deaths since the US-led troops displaced the Taliban from power in 2001.
This violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while President Donald Trump of the United States is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's army and the police.
According to correspondents, suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public confidence crisis against the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA annulled the decision to postpone the Smog Order following the actions
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama Regulation, which obliges states to limit emissions from smogs, one day after the 15 States brought the Agency to justice because of this move.
The EPA announced its decision to continue the "Ozone Concentration Action 2015" late on Wednesday, saying that it demonstrated the Agency's commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue and listen to our state partners," said the EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the determination of ozone concentrations by measuring smog pollution in different parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to October 2018 in order to comply with a more stringent air quality standard.
15 mainly democratic states, together with the District of Columbia, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to pull back a number of environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama, which, Trump says, is part of a more comprehensive plan to boost growth.
But these efforts have given rise to reactions among democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the increased impact of pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of ozone-containing air "may reduce the working capacity of the lungs and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases," such as asthma.
There may be a party on German pigs.
In Germany, pigs and cattle can have a feast because heavy rains threaten the prey of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, Bloomberg writes.
This year, it may be that weeks of rainstorms before harvest may mean that the bread-making fruit is only suitable for animal feed.
"The quality of the goat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agravis Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40 percent of German wheat can go for animal feed, which is twice as normal, predicted by Agravis.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First, the winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, which in June was replaced by a heat wave.
In July Germany was hit by rainstorms, which have continued in August.
Many eyes are turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area has not even begun harvesting yet, reported the local harvest collector in Ceravis.
"It's a pretty complicated day," said Ceravis' senior trader Frank Deckert of Rendsburg.
Coherence in all things, i.e. the clever widgets of Finnish interior design
The beautiful nature plays its part in the interiors of the fairhouses, as the magnificent views of the shores of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms through large windows.
At every step, our northern neighbours take note of their efforts to create both crutches and perfect (energy efficient) homes at the same time.
Finnish wood-use skills in construction and finishing materials, furniture and beauty products deserve admiration and also compliance.
Both the builder and the (home) designer can find exciting techniques and smart solutions in the fairhouses.
It is eloquently pointed out that black, white, and gray shades, when complemented by wood tones and indoor plants, can be very moody.
Good ideas can be picked for another week because the fair lasts until August 13.
Accessories and pots of herbs suggest that there is frequent cooking in this kitchen.
On the night of today, a line was drawn down on this year's Weekend Festival for Baltic, and Martin Garrix gave everything he could to remember as his last performer.
During Garrix's performance, the people were really upset - singing, houlating, dancing unselfishly.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was scattered from the beach of Pärnu to the city.
We'll bring you a gallery with all the pictures our photographer caught on Weekend in three days.
I'm sure you're in one of them too, so find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing possible confrontation
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the nearest boxing match of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in ESPN's office in Los Angeles in separate rooms until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, walked across the hall to welcome Lomachenko, World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
After the victory of Garcia's unanimous decision over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Showtime on Saturday, both fighters are at the top of the scales.
Garcia handed her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck to you."
Lomachenko will defend his belt with Miguel Marria on Saturday night at ESPN.
When a couple posed for the photographs, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible confrontation between the fighters would be "perfect measurement."
"I'm former feather-weight," Garcia reminded me.
"I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm six and a half pounds small.
I want to move down lightweight.
And it has to move up the weight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
This is what the fans have wanted.
Let us offer them this."
Lomachenko agreed.
"The world of boxing needs this fight."
Klimas raised the question of whether it should be subject to a fee: it is part of his strategy to debut Lomachenko towards the end of this year in the 61.2 kg class to make it possible for the next summer to meet Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also has an interest in fighting the winners of the Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell match after their 23 September Lightweight Round Forum.
"Looking at this fight could be subject to a charge, as fans have requested this confrontation," said Garcia, later saying that she was open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
"We're the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready..."
Garcia says she thinks Lomachenko's "a great fighter" and she can go watch her Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in congratulating Garcia, saying that he thought the master of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted this knockout."
According to Garcia, the goal was to show the impact and then fight.
Both confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them in order to be wealthy.
"This is the fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation will cause so much attention and hum.
I'm more than willing to work for it," said Garcia.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey has.
It's gonna be a good fight."
From which corners of the world will people move to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) extended and issued a record of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia to work, study or family.
For example, last year, when it was decided to issue a fixed-term residence permit to 6702 foreigners, the number was 4928.
Authorities do not know how many immigrants will end up in Estonia, but this analysis will be prepared at the Ministry of the Interior.
While nearly 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this figure is getting close to 2000.
The number of applicants for a residence permit increased dramatically during the Ukrainian crisis - 1087 people received a temporary residence permit in 2014, 675 a year earlier.
According to Statistics Estonia, the number of citizens of Ukraine is increasing most in Estonia - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia more than they left last year.
"The Ukrainian community has always been great in Estonia, and because of the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that employment and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many of the family are already ahead," stated Kristin Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who received a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, although in total the most temporary residence permits have been issued for the last ten years.
If the Ukrainians come here to work mostly, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Considering the historical Russian community here, they are more likely to have the greatest family ties with the people living in Russia," said Militia Research Fellow of the Academy of Home Affairs, Helina Maasing.
"When you look at where the Russian citizens who have obtained the Estonian residence permit have moved to, after Harjumaa there is an Ida-Virumaa," he added and pointed out that about 40 percent of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
At the same time, the number of Russians who wanted to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the application of a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia instead of extension of the residence permit," explained Rammus, spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained more stable for years.
A new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for from the previous year by foreigners who have lived here for at least three years.
Its aim is to encourage people who have adapted to stay here.
For example, a long-term resident's residence permit requires five years.
The extension of the old residence permit has probably also decreased because of the new residence permit.
For example, 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years were granted such a residence permit last year.
The Ukrainians can now switch jobs and the Estonian state will no longer follow the pay criterion.
This residence permit became popular from the blow - applicants were owners of the grey passport (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36) last year.
A total of 1968 people received a residence permit to settle in Estonia, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese.
In the first half of this year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
Within ten years, Nigeria has become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
In 2007, when three residence permits were issued to Nigerians, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens of India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has increased largely due to the mobility of students.
In their case, too, the rule is that where the community has come into existence, there will be more people," Rammus added.
In ten years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example, from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If about 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, this is about 0.46 percent of the total population.
Even if the citizens of the European Union were to be added, migration would remain around a percentage," Maasing commented that the figures were actually small.
According to Statistics Estonia, 14 822 people migrated to Estonia last year, and 13 792.
This means that immigration exceeded the second year of emigration.
Most of the movers are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them among the leavers.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative with 2 000 people last year.
Estonians mostly travel between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion charms with sats, embroidery and a fight.
The bottomless box of ideas is history for Maria Tamme Valley - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours in a museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do something with passion, you'll study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may look like a stranger to some people, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine in your life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of stew coouture dresses I've created.
Because it's not his fault he doesn't live in Hollywood and he doesn't go on a red carpet every day, he wants to wear those most beautiful dresses and wears them!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion designer does not recognize the gap between bright events and the grey day of everyday life.
It was this reasoning that made the plan to bring high fashions to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who often do not get to fashion.
Mammu's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion allele, where the royal defilt filled the whole street with 45 models.
In Tallinn, the pose is often taken in, noded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - calling bravo, getting up, wanting to thank you by your hand.
A lot of the audience just came by to take a look, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they will be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion design.
In Pärnu, we had a 50-metre-long red carpet full of beautiful dresses all over the street, and they didn't seem to end!
Maria also does not recognize the fashionable that creation must be presented by a super-salent supermodel; she is happy to bring on the stage ordinary women.
Often I invite my own clients on stage - they have always been happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you get to shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my show myself, I'm always behind the stage to give things the final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow me to watch the floor.
Maria is the kind of fashion designer who wants not only to play a representative role but to be in everything by hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I do.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited to stylistics, logistics, organization, organization - everything has to fit into the day of one temperamental woman.
I guess these hours of work are gonna be huge for fanatics.
I can't tell you when my day's gonna end, it's just a day of joy for me!
I'm still very lucky - it's like an incessant chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and a compliment in turn.
Several times it's been said that there's magic in my dresses - they make me feel like a princess.
The numerous tullous satires that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained the signature of Mammu Couture to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: Estonian subgroup tournament weapon now turned against us
Sorry, we ran out of fairy tale.
The first thing I noticed was that we couldn't get our table.
And if there's such a big difference at the table, there's nothing to do," Estonian U18 basketball boys 61:75 commented on the fall down to Britain by our only NBA basketball player, BC Kalev/Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
Opponents took 28 balls from the attack table and got so many more attacks as a result.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, it created.
Many English attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
But in defense, they could hold their hands anywhere. We couldn't combine.
It kicked the team's ass.
The opponents' homework was better done.
According to the mason, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to slow down the attack on its opponents.
In the last quarter - we had a zero error, but the opponents have already gotten several quick baskets.
Athleticism and intense insistence, which was our weapon in the subgroup tournament, now all turned against us.
Today we didn't have the strength against their aggression.
The wallsmith was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Cup.
In the tournament, you can generally say good words about the whole team, and to this day there was a single punch fist.
It's too bad they hadn't met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played it out today, but it seemed that he was tired - he has carried quite a burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves I've seen in practice before," added the tutor.
Terrible numbers: in the maiden basketball team, less than 10 points were scored in three quarters of the tournament...
The age class of U18 is not only a basketball tournament for the young men's EMB in Tallinn, the ladies started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland, unfortunately, tended to be in the field of anti-records.
Estonia lost 25:65, but after the third quarter, it was 9:49, or only in the last ten minutes the opponents took their feet off the gas pedal, and this period was tied to 16:16.
In the first and second quarters, Estonia scored 4, the third one points...
The Estonians first hit two of the first four shots in two minutes, then past the game 25, then one in three and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour, 47 shots of one were caught.
Plus, two points out of four free throws.
The number of ball losses was a reasonable figure in that time, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland's shot was 33 per cent and Estonia 13 per cent (68/9).
Estonia has started with two losses, and on the opening day, Portugal had to be recognised for the better 83:56.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a planned port visit to supplement the ship's reserves and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare to return to the sea and give the crew members a couple of days' rest.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be prepared for future operations on searching for historic explosive devices.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and their co-operation training in local waters is a good expression of our integration with the Allied forces," said Captain Major Arto Reinmaa, commander of the operational and planning department in charge of the Commander of the Navy Fleet.
Since 29 June, Latvian navy captain Gvido Laudups will lead NATO's 1st permanent mine control group, who took over the group commander's duties from the Estonian naval officer at the ceremony held in Riga from Commander Johan-Elias Seljamaa.
The group's flagship is a Latvian naval support ship in LVNS Virsait, which also operates the group's command headquarters.
This semester, the Estonian navy mine hunter Sakala is also part of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of vessels under the command of the NATO Marine Command, NATO's 1st permanent mine control group is a ready-to-be-read unit among the primary high-speed responders, who can be sent by the Alliance to different parts of the world within five days.
August 4 - 13, the ancient ruins of the Pirita Monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was brought to life 13 years ago by Maestro Eri Klas, will be held.
This year's Birgitta Festival will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented, according to the artistic director of Tallinn Philharmonic Risto Joost (36).
Risto Joost: The classics of the opera world include "Travita" and "Tosca," ballet productions from the enchanting "Boleros" to the fun "Karlsson" and neither does the program lack the self-production, which is this time the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful Oratorium "Years" by the same international creative team that brought Haydn's second masterpiece "Creating" on stage in 2015 in Pirital.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatre productions.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival that enchantment takes over and never lets go again.
Because the experience that a listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes human souls ring and touches human perceptions in ways that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic director of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't Maestro Eri Klas's shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Eri Klas, it has been very helpful.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of my career as a conductor.
Maybe that's why it's easier for me to continue her work.
Eri Klas has injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team, and of course it's all passed on to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of Eri Klas that gave me the strength to make progress with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonica.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could excite the audience at this year's festival, what are you offering?
We have artists from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the presentation will be the first ballet written in the story of Astrid Lindgren.
That's "Karlsson Flying."
And a curious nuance is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
Apparently, he's had Karlsson's character since he was a child.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my supportive life partner, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and fortunately, I have a lot of it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend so much on other people as on me, or on me, how I'm going to meet every new day.
And this conscious tone-keeping, holding positivity, and actually smiling yourself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have been particularly busy practicing it and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises tone.
It's not just a word.
I think people don't know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them yet, but I guess everyone finds it.
Right now, this is the big moment.
Do you have a ritual before you walk into the conductor's remote?
Yes, it is. We need to change clothes for more comfortable clothes.
It's this little moment for yourself.
But in general, yeah, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I actually like to have an active relationship with people, even before we go into the conductor's remote.
But come all the way to the Birgitta Festival, here's something to discover for not a very big opera and ballet friend!
Watch the moody video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for Swedish asylum applicants were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum seekers to assess their age with an innovative approach to medicine. The latest results show that more than 80 percent of the test subjects were estimated to be older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Institute of Forensic Medicine (Rätsmedicinalverket) started the tests at the beginning of this year.
The tests were created for a more accurate assessment of age in the process of applying for asylum after the Swedish Immigration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of a number of allegedly underage refugees.
Migrationsverket has now sent 6880 cases for testing and the Institute of Forensics has issued a total of 2481 test results between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) was estimated to be 18 years of age or older and in 25 other cases, the Institute of Forensics estimated that the test "may be 18 years of age or older'.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that a person is "probably younger than 18'.
Tests are only used if the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, who works at the Institute of Forensics, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see much difference from previous months' statistics, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large proportion of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that in 442 cases "there are indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases a person had made a direct claim that he would be 18.
This medical age assessment method, which takes X - ray pictures of wisdom teeth and MRI of knee joints and then allows dentists and radiologists to analyze them, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is the endocrinologist of the Karolinska Institute, Claude Marcus, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about this and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determination of biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't pretend we can," he said to the Metro newspaper.
But Johan Göransson, of the Institute of Forensics, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of placing a child imprecisely in adulthood is low.
The highest risk, i.e. about 10%, is when a person is just under 18."

The 20-year-old hammer thrower Anna Maria Orel debuted the London MM with a good 18th place on 67-37.
Orel was MM's youngest female hammer thrower, and a cheerful woman assured me that she was hoping to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well and got a good experience.
With the first test (64.80), I immediately made my average result, the second (62.80) risked too much, and the third (67.37) was able to keep my head clear," said Orel after the competition.
I was looking for my throw, and I'm really glad I found this.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended with a good 18th place.
The rain didn't bother the Organ because he's training winter through the TTÜ Stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little smile.
The London Olympic Stadium had almost a full house of people, did Orel sense people around him or could he shut himself down?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it gives more - that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with MM's debut and that he will have many more good competitions: "I came here with the 32nd or final result of this season, I ended up in 18th place.
That's a very good result.
I'm 20 years old and MMl-- that's all that matters.
I take with me a good experience, and some days I want to compete for medals.
The Governor of West Virginia announced a party change.
Governor Jim Justice, Western Virginia Democrat, announced at a meeting with President Trump on Thursday night that he would change parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I say to you, having prayed a lot and thought about it... today I say to you western Virginia that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
During the gathering, there was a burst of joy.
"So I'm going to be Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a trainer, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a big announcement earlier at the West Virginia meeting.
Trump won 42 points in West Virginia and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited the coal business from his father.
He's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "the governor's party change is another blow to the democratic party, which would rather prevent the country from being made better than working for it."
"All 15 governorships and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is just the most recent rejection of a party that is run to the end and cannot find a positive and unifying message," said RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel in a statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there's a lot of people, there's a lot of injured people.
Urmet, who was stationed at the medical tent on Weekend yesterday, told the Nightlight that they had had to hand out a lot of Band-Aids.
Wools and bruises are basic, twisting out and light falls.
Of course, also headaches, back pains and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors will come to the festival with the wrong shoes and this will be the problem.
Medical staff has also had to help visitors with a few major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and a broken leg.
We have also made stitches when a person breaks a hand or a finger.
Smaller stitches we'll do here, bigger ones we'll send to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the party medics are asking for a painkiller to treat the hangover.
Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal.
Sebastian Coe, an international champion of the Athletics, praised the "Russian Thursday's fair apology" for the doping scandal, but he reiterated that this is no time to allow the country to return to sport.
The Russian athletics leader Dmitry Shylakhtin said at the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, that his country's ban on competition is correct and has a firm goal of fighting doping.
He apologized to "all athletics who have had gold and silver medals snatched out of their hands."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest response today, a very honest presentation," said President Coe of IAAF to journalists.
"The Health Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian sub-union itself acknowledged that they had had had rather difficult times and that they were doing everything possible to restructure the sub-union."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its restoration.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the Group's proposal that this is not the right time to take Russia back," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can in the next few months to normalise the situation.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletics who meet the strict criteria of IAAF compete as neutral athletes at the World Athletics Championship in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, head of the IAAF working group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of recovery criteria.
Following his presentation to the IAAF Council, he told journalists in London that the doping check was still insufficient and that the banned coaches still operate freely.
The electric car revolution will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and losers?
Not only does the revolution in electric cars significantly change everything from the fuel market to infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win from one place and lose from another, smaller mining companies are not helped.
Glencore now serves from coal and oil, but in the future, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the era of electric cars.
This year, the United Kingdom, France and Norwegian governments have contributed to the spread of electric cars, allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already known that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine, and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car to the market.
According to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, more electric cars are already sold in two decades than oil-fired cars.
"With regard to some metals, this changes everything," said Capital Economics raw material analyst Simona Gambranini Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, whose demand has increased for years.
There are about three times as much copper in electric cars as in conventional cars, Glencore reported.
Even more copper is needed at loading stations, and according to Exane BNP Paribas, it will increase copper demand by about five percent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore benefits from the growing trend in electric cars from the price increase of copper and the world's largest cobalt producer, predicted by the Jefferies Group.
According to this broker company, the other winners of the race for electric cars are Freeport-McMoRan and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is responding to a changing trend.
This year, cobalt prices have risen by 70 percent on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also increased by 14 percent this year, mainly because of economic growth.
Glencore's stock rose by 20 percent in London, having exceeded the rivals Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo America.
On the losing side, lead companies like Recyclex and Campine have to adapt to a new era.
The main end-use of lead is the batteries supplying the starters of petrol and diesel cars.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to lead demand, unless it is identified as having other uses that could overcome the decline in demand," said Michael Widmer, chief metal market manager of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the unrolling trend in the form of lead price movements has not yet been noticed.
Lead has increased by 17 percent this year, and it is the best metal in London for the main industrial metals.
Investors see problems for metal only far in the future.
"I'm not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps ordinary cars competitive," said the sales manager of the metal broker company Triland Metals Herwig Schmidt.
If the demand for lead falls, it will be slow.
Maybe that's what's gonna happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter exhaust emission standards mean that demand for hybrid vehicles, which depend on lead-based batteries developed during frequent engine start-up, is assessed by the International Lead and Zinc Research Organisation.
Light metals like aluminium replace steel, because a lighter car can drive farther with less electricity.
This explains the additional minimum demand of 1.6 million tonnes between 2013 and 2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the global production of aluminium.
Probably this trend is getting worse, said Widmer.
The price of aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to a market deficit.
Steel manufacturers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding cooperates with General Motors to use nanotechnology to produce light car bodies.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter alloy steel to resist the aluminum.
"High-strength steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas' analyst Sylvain Brunet.
There is some success in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this precious metal was used as catalysts for diesel - powered cars, reported by metal refiner Johnson Matthew.
"Many now high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have much demand in the future," said Natixis raw material analyst Bernard Dahdah.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole become less important, but that their importance will change within 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in continued demand for diesel hybrid cars.
Uncore's leader, Marc Grynberg, said that in 2025 more hybrid cars would continue to be sold than full - electric cars.
The great hope for Platinum producers in a 10-year perspective is that Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos have developed hydrogen cell cars that depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
So far, however, this technology has not justified itself commercially.
"Diese seems to have a clear loser on the road to electric cars," said Exane BNP Paribasist Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July because the Stuttgart Court banned diesel use in the home towns of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How the financial rules for football affect Neymar's transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent Neymar's world record transition from the Spanish football club to Paris-Saint Germain, Barcelona, France.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that governs the European game and has the power to deny the teams the prestigious Championship League tournament, Paris Saint-Germain is still ahead of us.
The financial rules for fair play (FFP) established by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point demonstrate that Neymar's transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona received EUR 222 million ($262 million) for the mere purchase of a Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar's salary will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise this kind of money to recruit Neymar and to add it to a star-rich lineup, given that the team is funded by the family of Katari's energy-rich man.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of time recruiting players, but they must balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business.
The FFP was set up by Michel Platin after he was elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fall into large debts in search of success were actually involved in cheating and risk ruin if banks or owners were to give up support.
As of 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring these losses instead of the debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich used first in 2003 in Chelsea - to buy a club with potential and then to spend a lot of time making the team better and creating a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
In addition, the Commission considers that the measure constitutes State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
And despite the disgraceful rejection of Platin from office as President in 2015, his successor, Alexander Ceferin, remains committed to preventing excessive spending.
"FFP is certainly not dead, and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said Andrea Traverso to The Associated Press last week, who is the supervisor of the FFP at UEFA.
Although PSG paid for Neymar's over-purchase clause in the form of a single full payment, it is possible for them to divide this amount into parts for accounting purposes throughout the life of the contract.
Neymar entered into a five-year contract, which allows the transitional fee to be shown as an amount of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years.
In the case of the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Abu Dhabi Manchester City, suffered the most severe penalties.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (EUR 82 million at the time), which was subsequently reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies associated with club owners.
Although the company can sponsor PSG, if the value of sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as an official income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSG support for Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It has been said that some of Neymar's PSG service can come from Qatar through payments made by the World Championship Management Committee of 2022.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could be the champion of the World Championship and claim that UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The penalties previously imposed on the PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in any attempt to circumvent the rules.
The people familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition of Neymar proactively with the PSG.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition that their anonymity is ensured as they are not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.
The most recent published reports show that PSG made more than EUR 10 million in profits in the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of around EUR 542.4 million.
The data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that Neymar's arrival will have a good effect on sponsorship, commercialisation and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30 per cent in turnover due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly irritated by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to prevent Neymar's transition by claiming that PSG was thus in violation of FFP.
"This is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and state," said La Liga president Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal's manager, Arsenal Wenger, whose club belongs to an American sports magnate, shares La Liga's view that the state finances the club.
"This is the result of property rights and has completely changed the whole football landscape over the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests in order for such a large player to represent the country."

Today 50 years ago: the storm of the hurricane in Estonia, which tore roofs and windows from houses.
The hurricane called the storm of the century, which on August 6 and 7 caused great damage to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa in particular.
During these days, the wind speed in northwestern Estonia was over 30 m/s.
My old man ran from one curved tree to the other in the garden and touched his hands to support them.
Everything was dark and rattled, like the end of the world.
In the Taama, rooftops were already flying from houses, reminded old Mrs. Linda Kurova of Haapsalu in 2002 in an interview given to the magazine Eesti Loodus.
Linda's husband saw the garden he planted collapse.
But what do you do with your hands, where you get against a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, water squirted through the windows," said Mrs Linda at the time, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
That the roads were full of trees and that the roof of the railway platform had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalu people just as she did the next morning.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa the trees were lying down, some completely flat, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with crackles and crackles like war.
Lääne-Virumaa did not suffer much in the August 1967 storm compared to West Estonia, but the damage was also significant, wrote the Virumaa Official Journal in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padise Park were swept off the face of the earth, but our neighborhood parks were also severely damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speeds were measured up to 35 metres per second, or about 130 kilometres per hour.
In Tallinn Merivälja, on the evening of August 6, a little girl called out: "Mom, Mom!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down anymore!" wrote Virumaa's Journal.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm so that it was decided to be demolished later.
August Storm was not resisted by the constructions of the Türi ski jump mountain, which were later not restored.
On August 12, 1967, the Red Star wrote that the cleaning of towns and settlements from fallen trees and their branches was progressing slowly, and the residents could participate in the cleaning work.
Crop fields were also badly damaged in the storm, and the newspaper stated that "party organisations must be both inspiring and directing in the field of remediation and harvesting."
Hurricanes can be spoken of if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m/s.
The record of breeze wind in Estonia lasts from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnu was measured at 48 m/s.
A gauge was broken on the island of Vaindloo, so the measured wind speed could not be accurately recorded.
Secret of clean beaches: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The coldest summer weather also means a smaller cleaning effort in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"If there are no people, there are people on the beach, and if there are no people," says the beach janitor.
There are gulls screaming on the beach of North Tallinn Stoom.
They are faced with melodic competition from a low-turned tractor that plows stripes down on the plaster.
In fact, the last one sifts through the sand from a depth of seven centimetres, picking out debris from the sea and debris left behind by humans: bottle caps, cigarette butts, and more.
People still come to the beach, whether the water is warm or not.
If there is a beautiful weather, people will be on the beach, and if not, there will be no people," says Alexander Usov, the manager of the cleaning works of the beach in Haabersti Administration.
It's 6:30 a.m., and there's a bitter chore on the beach, because at 8 a.m., the place has to be good for people.
Usov's on duty by 4:00.
In addition to Stroma, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Harku Lake, Kakumäe and the Bare Island on Pikkari Beach.
The amount of garbage has decreased.
Years ago, it was so much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them," says Usov, who has been cleaning the beach for 15 years.
The way it was, when something new got set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
The price of a clean beach
One of the biggest works on the beaches of Estonia is the cleaning of the sea litter, i.e. the fence, washed up on the shore.
On Pirita Beach, for example, it has to be transported 400,000 tons during the coastal season.
"It's an incredible amount," notes Usov.
Another major category is household garbage, or everything that people leave behind.
The Beach Strip of Strom has eight large garbage containers that need to be emptied three times a week.
That's the amount of garbage you get.
However, colder summer weather has meant that garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is made up of abandoned things.
Most of the time, they're children's.
This time, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They wait for the owners to take the timber road to the beach.
Usov already knows he'll soon find them again in the sand.
Children come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The trash will be torn apart
Erika Scholler, representative of Haaberst's administrative services, admits that the tractor screening work is disrupted by locals.
The noise, which lasts from night to early morning, interferes with the sleep of neighboring people.
During the day, however, this work is impossible.
In one month, you have to sift the beach twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," says Scholler.
But like Pirita, Pikakar and Pärnu, the goal is to get the Stromi Beach under the quality mark of the international blue flag.
"There is much more work in Estonia than in Europe to ensure that beaches are maintained," says Scholler.
We have more sails and stones and harder to sift in the sand.
However, there is less garbage in our beaches than in other parts of Europe.
When he hears that there is talk of garbage on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach at Stoom, takes up the conversation circle between the journalist and the cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
There's a disgusting picture everywhere in the morning.
The problem is with birds and bottle pickers who have pulled garbage bags inside out," reports Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their previous behaviors, Martin hopes that the government will do something about trash cans and, for example, put lids on them to prevent at least birds from going there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Beach of Strroom.
You can see the city's taking care of it.
With children's squares, lit and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once the case that roller skates could only drive on one road," notes Martin.
Treasurer's Finds in Stroom: Coins, Coins Only
This morning's low season has come to be used by 40-year-old Dimitri, who, as a treasure hunter, combs the beach edge with a metal detector.
He doesn't think he'll find anything worthwhile today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough to do so.
"I've been doing this for a year and I haven't found anything worthwhile yet," reports Dmitri.
As a hobbie hunter, Dmitri's treasure bag contains some euro coins, bottle caps and also dangerous nails that later throws into the trash.
It's usually coins.
"There are usually no gold, rings, and such things," states the treasure hunter.
Bank of England holds interest rates at 0,25%
Bank of England is expected to report that interest rates remain at their former level, as weak economic growth and inflation easing have softened speculation on the rise.
Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish, as households' tight incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted in favour of keeping the 6:2 rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for growth.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank cut its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and its growth forecast for 2018 to 1.6% and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue, as inflation is still expected to rise close to 3% in autumn.
At the same time, the bank also indicated that the increase in rates would be necessary to contain the inflation caused by Brexit over the next few years and that a higher than expected increase in credit costs might be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the economic mammoth package launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
In February, the bank will complete a fixed-term financing scheme offering banks cheap funding, although it said that it is now expected to offer GBP 15 billion more, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the rate, the bank states: "In the central MPC forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain insolvent in the near future, as the difficult situation of households' real incomes will continue to have an impact on consumption."
In terms of rates, it was repeated that inflation needs to be mitigated by a "some tightening of the monetary policy" to the extent that markets are expected to do so.
The stock exchange is currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that all kinds of jumps are gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and next year are comparable to the forecasts for May of 1,9% and 1,7%.
The forecast of an increase of 1,8% in 2018 was maintained.
After this news, the rate of the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound dropped by 0.5% to USD 1,31 and by 0,4% to EUR 1,11.
The decision not to make changes is due to recent disappointing growth indicators, which have dampened the growing expectations of GDP growth in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to gain some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice in households suffering from rising inflation and wretched wage increases, saying that the situation would get a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy cannot prevent income-related shocks in the next few years, but a marked recovery of wages is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Because of the weak pound, the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates consumers for lower costs, also stimulates the economy.
The decision comes a year after the rates were set at 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused a sudden weakening of the nail.
According to the Bank, it is likely to take four years to fully breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for raising the rate, as inflation had increased pressure on households in distress; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase of 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was to be expected and there will be a rise again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was entirely due to weak pounds.
Andrew Montlake, the head of Correco's mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent drop in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive again, as lenders want to work and hope to end the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are coming to an end as refinancing, often free of charges and at low rates, has become increasingly popular."
NHS is writing 10,000 people into conflicting HIV medication
Since September, patients have had access to "transformative" HIV preventive treatment after a battle in the Supreme Court about whether the NHS should fund the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health now makes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) available to an estimated 10,000 people during the initial three-year clinical trial, a tablet administered before intercourse, which has shown a reduction in the risk of infection by approximately 86% for people at high risk.
NHS agreed to finance the clinical trial after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court's decision last year, according to which the NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite its own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Simon Stevens, the CEO of NHS England, welcomed this public announcement on Thursday as a "new widespread intervention', while the NAT described it as a "turnover moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, there will be more clinics before the program is implemented anywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a shed of HIV medicines taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
The results of clinical trials indicate that PrEP significantly reduces transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Appropriate candidates include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV infected and not receiving treatment.
The clinics identify suitable people who are willing to participate in the clinical trial, including men, women, transgender people and those whose HIV partner is not receiving antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there can also register at the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The program costs £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get medical supplies this week after an international procurement procedure.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the real potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for and how it is consumed and applied in the large picture.
Stevens said: "This new widespread intervention should complement and amplify the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against HIV transmission.
This is another milestone in the fight against one of mankind's greatest health problems over three decades."
Deborah Gold, the CEO of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if targeted correctly for those who need it and are at risk, offers the opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high HIV risk in England have access to a powerful new tool, which is individually manageable and independent of negotiations with their partners, through this NHS-funded clinical trial, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, the CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now vital to ensure that the clinical trial is speeded up across the country and that no HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the clinical trial drug of PrEP has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.
Sharon Hodgson, the shadow minister of public health, said: "The start of the clinical trial of PrEP is very welcome and very late after months of delays and dragging the feet of the government.
Evidence shows how much change this medicine can bring to the prevention work of HIV and the end of the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial is taken across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to bring us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society."
Electricity prices increased by 12% in Estonia, while in Latvia and Lithuania they fell.
In July, the difference in the electricity exchange price between Estonia and the Latvian and Lithuanian price areas decreased to 1.94 euros, compared to 7.71 euros in June this year, Elering reported.
The main reason for this price difference is the Lithuanian-Swedish connection failures.
The average exchange price for electricity in Estonia was 34.33 euros in megawatt-hours last month, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
The price in Finland was 34.17 euros and the system price in Nord Pool was 26.37 euros per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7 per cent respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland electricity moved 75 per cent of last month's hours towards Estonia and 16 per cent of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
In the remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries there were no transactions for the next day.
Between Estonia and Latvia, 99% of the time electricity moved from Estonia to Latvia, and 73% of the hours had total transmission capacity in use.
According to transactions on the last trading day of July on the Nasdaq OMX market, the exchange price for electricity in August could be around EUR 34 and EUR 37 per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the electricity production price increased last month and transactions took place between EUR 5,04 and EUR 5,47 per tonne.
Living in high life - half-floor and smart design tips have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker who is a passionate real estate innovator, exchanged his large Knightsbridge home for Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It is located on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace and the fact that Joanne has not packed her bags and sold the apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on much larger ground," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I offered.
I was shown this Earls Court apartment and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day."
Since the first visit, this 93-square meter apartment has undergone a complete renewal course.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to reach the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands," he said.
He hired Duck & Shed, an architectural and design studio in Erfan Azadi Notting Hill, to take advantage of the 3.8 m high ceilings and create a home that is not just a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two spaces to each other, so it was an architectural challenge to create a semi-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan had to approach it creatively.
"Metal structure is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to reorganize the rooms so that they would be on top of each other without having to bow down.
It was not just a platform construction, but a steel structure so that the height of both the upper and lower rooms would be right."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two rooms of full height with many dramatic elements in the room.
From the half-floor there is a view of the glamorous dwelling below the window of Retrouvius with an ancient copper light.
Golden furniture with mirror surface, silver details and a retro-coloured Serge Mouille luminaire emphasizes the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatricality, space and light.
Mirrors have been added to both ends of the short corridor to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored back wall makes it look like a window opening in another room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The living room is enchanted by the possibility of closing the kitchen part if it is not used, creating an image of a more glamorous room.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
This kitchen, however, is unique in the fact that it is a garage-type liftable door.
"It was a bit of a design effort," explains Erfan from a steel-strengthened MDF door.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of the room and the storage room, Joanne now has 16 extra square meters, an additional bedroom and a better housing plan.
"In the end, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives value to real estate," says Erfan.
"A real estate agent enters an outdated form and makes calculations based on the surface area of the floor."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"Materials are what you touch and thus help create an emotional bond with your home," says Erfan.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring."
This shows that good design and increased area help to make a rather ordinary apartment something amazing.
In fact, they may even cause a desire not to leave, as happened to Joanne.
Chief character Dane Jensen is a Chicago skyscraper bounty hunter who competes with a colleague for promotion.
It doesn't matter anything but the amount of money you've earned, and you forget about ethics.
The man sees his wife and three children only early in the morning and late in the evening.
In the first part of the film, I find myself thinking that this is a version of the business world of "Cardhouse" - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech is similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the footage element stays, and the moralizing intention of the filmmakers becomes more evident.
The life-changing experience of the main character becomes the cancer of the son's disease.
A choice must now be made between work and family life.
A son who dreams of an Architectary profession makes his father think of really important things like faith, goodness, love on his way to the big buildings in Chicago, not even a double tower disaster.
After the third scene, where the son opens his father's eyes, the filmmakers feel that the aim of the audience is surely to cry, because even the most harsh-hearted viewer can't hold back the tears in the face of the suffering of a beloved cancer - sick boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his condition seems almost hopeless, his father will finally understand the morality of his work and do a good work for an old man.
Now I'm betting with myself - if the movie has happy self, I'll reward my perceptiveness after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the writer can be commended for at least one surprise.
For a moment, there's a suspicion that I'm losing my coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital and he's running slowly down the hallway towards the room.
Rather, the son is miraculously healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also positive, for now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama pretty well!
To be honest, the film is well-designed, and all the elements necessary for it are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, actors are good and morally beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie's gonna bring in a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the President's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
Then he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new Chief of Staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trumpin, including news, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a milder water.
Here's an excerpt from Josh Dawsey:
"When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first working day, he brought out a key problem at President Donald Trump's White House, which he was planning to solve in the hands of the President.
Kelly told the officials that information had to go through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the President would make better decisions if she were given good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes perfect sense, but others have tried, too, and they have failed to tame Trump by monitoring his media consumption.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades, and now that he's in the White House, his TV viewing habits have not gone away.
"When the candidate Trump was upset about dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also honestly reflected in influenced publications," Sam Nunberg, former campaign advisor, said to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at the time that "six former campaigners said that Trump's key to controlling Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption also contains a stable praise song."
All right.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habits have ever been "controlled" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaigners know something the rest of us don't know that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammable without their intervention.
We'll probably never know about tweets Trump didn't post.
If his assistants were able to save him from trouble even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of competing clicks, people are trying exclusively to promote their own interests by providing Trump with material that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, which reflects the whole story, wrote in May about the councillors' tendency to provide information of strategic value to the president.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is:
"Current and former Trump employees say that Trump may react to a negative press, especially with harmful effects on information leaks, explosively, obsessing about the source of their source.
This was also the case at the end of February when someone gave the president a happyly printed copy of the article of the website GotNews.com, which belongs to Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of multiple leaks" of the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is permanently blocked from Twitter because of his mockery, or that he didn't offer any concrete evidence, or that he's been falsely accused in the past and taken them back.
Trump read the article and began asking his subordinates about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Head of the White House's Office, Rob Porter, "has tried to put in place a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trumpini."
How did it work?
Kelly's trying to do the exact same thing three months later.
Maybe he'll turn out to be a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his assistants are still competing for influence.
These unchangeable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians from abroad will not be anxious to obtain permission to perform.
Many foreigners perform music in the centre of Tallinn.
Those with whom the Evening Newspaper spoke admitted to playing in the Old Town without the permission of the city government.
First, we found three street musicians near Viru's gates who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with dreadlocks and broken clothes were backpackers who could use a shower.
Despite the appearance, the only woman in the group played a jolly rhythm song on the accordion, while a man next to him juggled with three balls and invited the passers closer.
The third man had sat beside them on a backpack and smoked a self-made joint in peace of heart.
Their three dogs would not be disturbed by the passing crowd.
Bob, who juggled with Noem and the balls who played the Akordion, said that he was playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company's performance was to collect ticket money for a ship sailing to Finland on the evening of the same day.
The question is, did they ask the city for permission to play music in the old town, shake Noem and Bob's head?
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one city for more than a day or two, and most of the permits are given for a month or something.
There's no point in paying for it," explained Bob.
When we got back to Viru's gates about 20 minutes later, we saw that two women were with musicians and drove them away.
The company moved with their backpacks and dogs to the Viru Centre intersection to try their luck.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one of whom played the violin, the other played the clarinet, and the third had carried an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people to spread music and joy and make money for fuel and living," explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware of the need to have a government permit to perform.
"Of course we don't have it," he said, joking.
But we hope that if people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we'll go somewhere else, but we have to try," he added.
Eesti Pank purchased 149 million euros of bonds in July under the euro area central banks' public sector asset purchase programme; the central bank's bond portfolio grew to 4.36 billion euros in total.
The central bank does not publish more detailed information about purchases.
The Governor of Eesti Pank, Hardo Hansson, has previously explained in response to questions from members of the Riigikogu that the Eurosystem's central banks' asset purchase programme covers three different purchase programmes: covered bonds, ABS and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys up bonds on the market to encourage investors selling bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the return on lower-risk assets and this motivates investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds as part of a public bond purchase programme, while other sovereign bonds are not purchased.
As the Estonian state has not issued bonds, Eesti Pank will make so-called replacement purchases within the limits of the volume allocated to them.
The central banks will also make replacement purchases in those countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
According to Hansson, Eesti Pank generally buys bonds from European institutions, such as the European Financial Stability Fund and the European Investment Bank.
Eesti Pank will purchase bonds as part of the asset purchase programme as of March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also acquired, but Eesti Pank will no longer buy Elering's bonds in June 2016.
On behalf of the central banks of the euro area, both Elering and Eesti Energia will be buying bonds from the Finnish central bank from June onwards.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to the "millionaire district"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again faced fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the ditches dug by the council to win back the field away from their villas.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field into a prosperous "millionaire district" near Solyull Street.
They have returned with an army of horses, children, and trucks after they were kicked out of there only in May without being disturbed by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a weakness in the barrier, squeezing their vehicles through the unstoppable part left on the road.
The angry people have cursed the council of Solyuhl, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday evening after they were displaced from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers.
The Council must be shamed to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
They came in last night, probably even more today."
He added: "Birmingham's council knows how to deal with these things by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on the road to Streetsbrook, and I'm not happy that I have to continue paying council fees if the council can't even stop this kind of thing."
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: "This is ridiculous, and we have only seen the last of these travelers leave, and a new attack is already taking place.
This time the number has increased and the grassland has even seen the horse chewing up."
The representative of the Solyuhl Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campground in the country near Streetsbrook Road, and we are working with the Solihull police, and we are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It is very helpful to gather evidence when as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling at 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them."
The Weekend festival is visited by Indrek Saar, the Minister of Culture, among others, who is pleased that real world top names have been brought to Estonia.
To the question of why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians, Saar says that this should be asked by all those who enjoy the festival in full three days.
But he does realize that the real players of their field have arrived in Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that has been brought to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are being brought home - this often does not happen in our neighborhood," says the Minister of Culture.
What are the artists at the festival, however, who speak most about Saart himself?
I think I'm a relatively old man, and for old people like me, one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his record twisting, at some point all of us have been spinning our own feet," he says.
However, he still brings out a number of names, such as Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Of course, our own Estonian makers too: starting with NO-P and they can be read in a whole series.
In fact, this well-known name concentration is very high," he says.
Take a look at the Nightshade video!
Audi renews up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of the criticism of car manufacturers
The day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it offers software upgrades to more than 350 000 vehicles.
According to the Chairman of the BMW, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions" by referring to European cities, including BMW's hometown Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce the emissions of diesel engines.
None of the companies described these activities as being recalled.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the regulations on CO2 emissions.
However, nitric oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise the emissions of diesel vehicles will be increased for automotive companies, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under in-depth investigation, the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen's mistakes, who were silent about the use of so-called cheating devices, which enabled the readings to be adjusted to comply with the regulations during the testing of the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
A number of Volkswagen leaders have been prosecuted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics division of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former director Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was drawn into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused Audit of installing a system to circumvent European emissions requirements, thereby extending the investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The involvement of an Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen by a luxury car manufacturer generating a disproportionately large part of Volkswagen's profits.
For 20 000 euros, Estonian schools purchase European Union flags.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the presidency.
The total size is 105x158 centimeters from the 570 educational establishments of the EU flag.
Flags are intended to be displayed indoors; they must also be carried out in high-quality printing techniques indoors with tunnel mounts, and the ERR news portal will mediate them.
There is a text on the flagpole label: "King to Estonian schools to mark the first Presidency of the Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of the 570 flag is 20 000 euros at the Ministry of Education's price, i.e. one flag will cost 35 euros.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually gather on Wednesdays to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, caused by organised crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of a personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They are told that it is important to change our routines.
Two senior writers are discussing which seems safer: either to bring the children to the office that was the target of a grenade attack in 2009 or to leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the top of the room: "enemies," "neutral," "Allies."
They ask reporters to provide no evidence for each column, enough impressions and intuition.
The fact that the government or cartels employed is suspected of being drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists is a whole list of bad guys who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
According to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, most of these bodies have been collected since President Enrique Pena Nieto was sworn into office in December 2012 by at least 25,589 journalists following attacks and threats under public protection and seven journalists in seven states have still died during this year.
The latter include their editor and inspiration, the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, even though his presence can be perceived everywhere on the facade of the Riodoce building, a large picture of Valdez, showing the middle finger, with the letter "Justice" and two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts that depict his smiling eyeglass face or his characteristic panama hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters will discuss common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although in 2010 a separate state prosecutor's office was set up to deal with cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce editorial continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the scenery is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, Ibarra says the security meeting is of little use.
"It's really stupid to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"Until the cause is known, you mistrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in the state capital, Culiacan, on the morning of May 15th.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, forced to get out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper name, which means translated "Twelfth River."
An armed man drove off in Valdez's car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, Valdez is mainly a matter of silence.
Since the arrest of Guzman last year and the extradition to the United States of America in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields because rival clicks are fighting for the execution of a power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that some people, or even several, are shot every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is plentifully decorated with the mausoleums of double drug kings that are larger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that peacetime refers to the fact that only one cartel runs a seaside state with valuable ports and drug routes to the United States.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers involved in his work, Riodoce's co-founder and manager Ismail Bojorquez (60) feels enormous remorse that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to the killing.
The first of these was the publication of an interview with the leader Damaso Lopez of the cartel competing with the sons of Guzman and at war.
This piece of writing may have pissed off the young, the suspected gang members bought all the copies of the publication as soon as they reached the newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after the raid took place in another newspaper that reported the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in the violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would be there forever.
He worked for the Noroeste newspaper in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinalus "was impossible to deal with the press without touching the drug problem."
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation with its bold and honest expressions, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters liked to publish powerful research without fear of censorship and fascinating publications that they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, the newspaper won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize for its Latin American reflections.
In the same year, the Valdez Journalists' Protection Committee (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of Journalism for its courage to follow the Mexican drug history wherever it leads.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live," he said when he accepted the AKK award.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to accept the task of being a journalist, which is another way to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on."
The Riodoce Collective yearns for Valdez, a joker who was raving like a sailor, a friend who kindly shared embraces and counsel, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They leaned on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love got him killed.
His death has also led them to doubt how best to do their work and to survive.
"They don't like you messing with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is strong self-censorship and self-preservation even in the best of times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay out of it.
According to Riodoce's editor Andres Villarreal, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's what happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipasi, Veracruz, Guerreros or other states, which are home to a toxic combination of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt state officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
In front of the house, two policemen were looking for relief from 40 degrees of heat in the shadow of the tree.
The government assigned them to guard the Riodoce office in a four-storey building in the middle-class neighborhood of Culiacani.
Some reporters wondered whether these policemen were among the 50 percent of police officers who the governor himself had misjudged.
Several months have passed since reporters have traveled to highlands where the control is de facto in the hands of drug gangs.
Riodoce's publication this week covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of Julio Cesar Chavez's brother, a former boxing legend, in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was needed when it was time to write what everyone in the city knew about the restaurant as a favourite place for both drug dealers and public authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered to a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
In recent times, several IRP governors have been accused of corruption in the context of a wide range of cases.
Villarrea asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, who was nicknamed El Chapo, escaped the military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have searched the Valdez column for information on kidnapping from the best sources.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, whose dress has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all communication channels are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, and editorial staff has become something they never expected activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and headed to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after the killing of Valdez in the west state of Michoacan.
A burnt body has been found, and officials say it belongs to him based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country have become more vocal and are scribbling the phrase SOS press as an organized protest on the sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Bojorquez will be away in Washington, Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez's death, when he met the Governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked to be diverted from the government's activities, worrying that his anger had affected his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "limited" by organised crime, co-indictious public officials and an indifferent society.
In his last book Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by the orders of politicians and security forces who are involved in organised crime.
The media monitoring team Articulo 19 attributed more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and public officials last year.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to shut you up," said Ramirez.
The murders are obviously bloodthirsty.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter, probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his beheaded head was a computer keyboard and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in Chihuahua, the northern border state, after the murder of their correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue as El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their manager in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed drug cartels in public with the headline "What do you want from us?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled home states or even the country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find a job in exile, and they still have to look at the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they are chased, as probably happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered along with four women in 2015 in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay put and continue to work have to dance every day around risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that reflecting the drug business scares him.
"Mexican's on his way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office, sipping beer when all of a sudden started vibrating on everyone's phones.
In Mazatlan, a resort town along the coast, 19 people were confirmed to have died in gunfire between rival gangs and security forces.
The war continued to escalate, as allowed by a number of messages from cartels found in the region.
From there on the edge of the sidewalk, reporters put the news on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front cover of the next day needed a change.
The sirens were screaming at another gunfight in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the officers on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were scared, at least they didn't show it.
Under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, on which his middle finger can be seen all over Sinaloa, Riodoce's employees followed in his footsteps.
"How could you even think about closing," said Bojorquez, "when the day Javier was killed, the trainee asked me to send him to the streets for a report?"
Dinosaur used a protective color to prevent his enemies.
At first glance, it seems like a statue, though quite frightening.
Scientists have now released the first findings regarding the incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner, so well preserved that experts have described it as "the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
It is even so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his armored skin was reddish-brown in colour and his past had been somewhat "complicated."
In the journal Current Biology published the reportage described the creature as "the best preserved armoured dinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaur states in the world."
Fossil is a new species of nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good preservation struck the researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."
According to National Geographic magazine, this armored vegetarian is the best preserved fossil of the type that has ever been found.
It was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millenium in a mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
He caught something that didn't resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to look into it.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, an animal was developed to excavate 2,500 pounds (1100 kilos) of land.
After all this hard work, the end result is now finally ready to be made public.
"If you squint a little, you can almost believe he's asleep," said the leading author, Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum, where the creature is exhibited.
"It goes down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
When researching his skin, researchers found that this plant eater, although covered with scales and reminiscent of a walking tank, was likely to be a significant threat to carnivorous dinosaurs.
This large - scale dinosaur used a red and white color to hide from predators and applied a cloaking technique called a counter-shadowing technique, which many animals today use.
This, according to experts, allowed the dinosaur to blend in better and avoid enemies, since the larger dinosaurs were likely hunting him.
This 110 million-year-old Nodosaurus creature first arrived on the news in May and is now visited at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Researchers have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, the laboratoryman of the Museum of the Borealpelta Markmitchelli, who was part of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in an effort to expose the animal.
Thanks to the amazingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of scales on the animal's body.
They discovered an eclipse - a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, meaning that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although the eclipse has spread, the findings come as a surprise, since Borealopelta is much larger than today's animals with an eclipse.
This suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to be hiding as a survival tactic instead of confrontation.
But most animals - such as deer, zebras, or armadillos - using modern eclipses are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a hugely large dinosaur covered with heavy scales shows how dangerous dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous age may have been," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaur was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal to get clues about its life, including the surviving contents of its intestines, to find out what the animal would eat for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when it died, thus reaching the sea with the flow, where it sank in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Alberta was as warm as now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely farther inland than they are now.
"This nodosaur is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, while it remains also three-dimensional, preserving the animal's original shape," said Brown.
"As a result, an animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous period.
You don't have to use much imagination to reconstruct it - it's just enough to squint your eyes and it seems like she's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was the time when the vast dinosaurs - teropods of flesh-eating dinosaurs roamed the earth on two legs.
Although all of these King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been hunted by some of his formidable predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 - foot - long - weighing monster weighing six tons (11.5 meters).
Scientists whose recent findings have been published in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was washed into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined the Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including leather and scales, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored plant-eater had adventured through the present West Canada until the flooded river washed into its open sea.
But the subsea burial site of the dinosaur helped to maintain its scales in excellent detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bumpy scales along the dinosaur skulls continue to cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic: "The degree of preservation is as rare as the lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin continue to cover the bumpy scales on the animal's skull.
The right front leg lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his stable."
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was completely shocked.
Just one day after travelling to New York, this St. Louis resident, Airbnb, was sitting in a rented room on the bed, browsing Facebook on the phone.
He ended up in the post of his old schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still lying on the street."
He was confused why no one else had posted this information in his stream, so he closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Blind @TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared on his timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis area reported live tweets about Michael Brown, the death of an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He put his phone away, but later tonight he saw another tweet that announced a gathering of people on the Canfield Drive this time.
Photos of police tapes and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign saying, "Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son!"
He watched a real-time flow where a policeman stood in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop, he said, pulled a gun and yelled, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "This is unusual."
"This isn't the kind of murder we're used to and we could call typical."
I felt scared at the time.
I was angry and crying."
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11 o'clock, he went to his father's house to pick up his six - year - old daughter and decided that they were going to Ferguson together the next morning.
What took place with Ferrelli and Ferguson in the next three years is a central theme in the new documentary "Whose Streets?" which will appear in the cinemas on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and stamina from the perspective of people who live in this community and who filled the streets in demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who was wearing a flowery dress and had a suitable crown in their head - went to Ferguson, they again discussed the subject that they had repeatedly mentioned before this morning - about the experiences and living conditions of the black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he reminds me of asking.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that's not right."
"I couldn't not take her with me," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of past events.
He needs to know it and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation, and at the same time know the different layers of black experiences and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I succeed in raising him without personally experiencing impertinent racism, he is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I'd do him a disservice if I were to protect him from this world."
The first stop they made when Ferguson arrived was on the South Florissant road - a place across the street from a police station that had become a kind of camp site where activists were waiting for news about a police officer named Darren Wilson, who wasn't finally prosecuted.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunches.
They put together groceries and helped share them with protestors.
For Ferrelli, a new type of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, pointing out that when he was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, he was the president of the Minority Student Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no organizational experience.
It's all just worked out."
Weeks later, Ferrell met with the codirector Sabah Folayan during the evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and filmmaker Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was going on.
The question came to Ferrelli's mind: "Are you trying to document what was happening or find a story that could be used?"
Such skepticism was the result of countless cases where people - often Caucasians - enter the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson would not be heard, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already struck hands with codirector Damon Davis, an artist in the region who was known for his activism in connection with prisoners sentenced to death.
His involvement made the project attractive for Ferrelli and six other locals, who were watched by the crew of Whos Streets after Brown was shot for years.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm pictured."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrelli's experience - it was to show that the movement was not a "releasing guide, but a community reunion," as Folayan said - it became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Whose Streets" document surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrelli's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
"I felt like I was naked," said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw a sheet work.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain vulnerability."
Moreover, Ferrelli's story highlights and refocuses the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three instigators of the movement, who in 2012 invented a theme reference #BlackLivesMatter after the murder of black teen Trayvon Martin, are homosexual.
"The leading role of black homosexual women has been universally maintaining movement," said Ferrell, "and that is precisely because we have to fight constantly on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear this burden."
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is indeed maintained by black women and many of them are black homosexual women."
He argues, however, that "it is not a matter of any kind of equal opportunities" - Ferrelli was not chosen as the focus of the film because of his identity.
"He was the person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it's no coincidence that he was directly on the front line because there's a lot at stake as a black homosexual woman living in such hubs.
His energy can be perceived through the screen."
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will last another 2.5 years.
He describes the socio-political climate in the region he calls home, simply as a "huge threat."
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra that he has etched into memory since he went to Ferguson streets three whole years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support one another.
We have nothing to lose but our chains."
7 tricks to get over the hangover after the Weekend party.
Some of the toughest cubs find it helpful after a drinky party.
Or they come from the saying, "Avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable delay and a healthy pussy.
What can you do to make yourself better in the morning and get over the hangover as painless as possible after the Weekend Rally and tomorrow?
Drink some water.
On the booze down and down, after a big party in the morning... or even if possible instead of alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid when it consumes alcohol, it has to be recovered somehow.
Together with water, minerals are washed out of the body and it is therefore good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is especially good to have it bubble-free or slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't take a hangover to go to Grandma's to break trees -- it could be a fatal lie.
But a simple walk will help your body remember what it's like to be alive.
Lying in a tent and sleeping a hangover out is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body back energy slowly and carefully.
If you're already vomit from drinking yesterday, you shouldn't try to load a big fat steak in your stomach.
Begin, for example, with fresh juice, where the fruit sugars contained will quietly nourish your body.
If you are already suffering from health around lunch, perhaps you could try a broth.
And a little later on, the back.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic is releasing your body from all water.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol and will lose performance.
That way you're gonna ruin your liver even more, and the hangovers are gonna be worse.
In addition, the painkiller does not last very long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach - it'll upset your already torn stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along with yourself.
It works like walking, but you can't orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid overactive paces and crazy poses - during hangover, physical effort should be moderate.
You gotta be kidding me.
Make a fool of your friends and fellows, make simple fools and laugh friendlyly over yourself and others (suffering).
Joke and laughter may not make a hangover go away, but they certainly make the aftereffects more fun.
One day the hangover will go away anyway!
The Northwestern Professor and the staff at Oxford University are wanted as suspects of murder.
According to the police, a national search is being carried out for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who has become suspects after finding a man's body in a luxury apartment in Chicago with fatal stabbing wounds.
According to Cook County court records, arrest orders for 42-year-old Wyndham Lathem and 56-year-old Andrew Warren were issued on Monday for the murder of the first degree due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to documents, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after being stabbed again.
According to a warning issued by the Chicago Police Department to the community, the body was discovered on July 27th.
The police received a phone call, and when they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment building, they found a victim with multiple puncture wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators treat stabbing as a murder, while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathem has worked as a co- professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for Public Relations at the University, said in an e-mail that Lathem has now been suspended temporarily and has been banned from entering Northwestern University campuses.
"It is now a criminal case under investigation by the competent authorities and the University of Northwestern cooperates with investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at Oxford University Finance.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are ready to assist US research institutions in every possible way."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Communication at the Chicago Police Department, urges suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of where they are, but we are increasingly engaged in identifying the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, the suspects are assisted by local, regional and national authorities.
Guglielmi said the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received a cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described it as a hideous sight.
According to Guglielmi, it is not clear whether the event itself also took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirm Lathem and Warren's presence in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," added Guglielmi.
The management of the Grand Plaza sent a letter to the residents: "The police are currently working on chronology of events and on finding out the background of the victim and examining various motives, including the possibility that this was a family dispute."
Start-ups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the satisfaction of employees at her e-commerce start-up, but the polls were in vain.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs the e-commerce company Madison Reed, which sells hair care products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called on outsiders to help.
New start-ups dealing with human resources are on the verge of helping companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with the firm objective of measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer workers anonymity and hot line of complaint and in some cases allow language media to pass C-level managers and address directly to the board.
"Now there are tools such as Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, in the three years he's been using Glint, he's had a much better insight into what his employees think and feel.
In addition to surveys aimed at sudden research and specific teams, it offers a company thermal map that provides an overview of which departments have the highest number of complaints and which managers have the lowest support, allowing them to identify the reasons.
Companies have begun to realise that they must keep up to date with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been engulfed in scandals since the former employee published a blog post that described an abusive environment where those who dared to speak were punished.
For start-ups such as Glint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
Global management, regulation and compliance can be worth more than $187.7 billion by 2020 according to the data of the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Convercent, a start-up company operating in Denver, Colorado, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, noted an increase in interest and activity in the context of Uber's suspicious reputation this year.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glint, Converter has companies send customised impulse surveys, collect real-time confidential answers and view heat maps from problematic areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line that allows employees to report inappropriate behaviour.
And as far as the CEO is concerned, complaints go directly to the board.
"The public opinion has been analysed by the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
Quinlan said that if a company were to find that its employees were being mistreated or misbehaved, the company could face serious consequences, such as consumer boycotts, staff leaving and legal proceedings, even if the regulatory authorities did not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees at 500 sites, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and provide an easy way to communicate with the corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find the corporate headquarters phone number or email address, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a daunting and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general advisor James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employees' complaints.
However, now that the company is using Converter, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices can be identified and dealt with more quickly by managers operating in offices in other cities or states.
"I can get closer to the holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday's risk management team.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, i.e. after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
However, only when "social media matured" did companies realize that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from being publicly washed online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Converter offer their software as a service, taking a periodic fee from companies for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have supported both start-ups.
In February, Converter was sponsored by $10 million by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, thereby raising the value of the capital raised to $47 million.
In November, Glinti invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing the company's total funding to $60 million.
Such investments are not surprising given the interrelationship between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more research shows that modern workers expect more from the workplace than before.
In competitive markets, such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely wagers on the table.
Workers want to feel that they are accepted and valued and that they devote their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy in the company, they feel they are being listened to and that the work they do is rewarding, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, who is Vice-President of the General Benefit and Staff Experience Department in LinkedIn, which uses both Converter and Glint.
Investors earn income if the companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow for greater commitment and involvement of workers, then it is no wonder that they find support.
Having data on employee involvement is important, according to experts of the working culture.
However, these data are useless if the company supervisors do nothing with them.
In fact, if a company asks for feedback from its employees, it can create expectations that change is coming.
And if changes do not happen quickly enough or not at all, they can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"When you ask for 4000 proposals, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations," said Kotter International President Russell Raath, who has seen how companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"Because if things aren't finished, the workers will think, "Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care?" "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly surveys among staff, has been able to take action on the same day as the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from frustrated staff at the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganize several teams in the company and provide communication training to deal with the problems.
However, Ruby Tuesdays collects new data on workers and it is hoped that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in an industry known for its high turnover.
"If you are not committed to ensuring transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies."
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: income growth is fast
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltics, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the incomes of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes referring to the report of the European Central Bank.
According to the central bank, since 1999, total economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Progress is driven by low indebtedness, fast-growing institutions and business and free market-friendly policies.
"The Baltic countries, along with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita has approached the EU average significantly" was reported by the central bank.
Although the aim is to ensure that the total production per capita of the economy is equal to that of the richer Western Europe, in 2015 the total production per capita of the Baltic economies amounted to just 2/3 of the average of the 15 countries that belonged to the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltics to look for better wages abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltics in a positive light and the economy is also growing this year, the local population is not enthusiastic.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of the Latvian and Lithuanian population estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, slightly less than half of those surveyed for their economies felt that way.
The NCAA's decision to cancel practice twice a day makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23 o'clock when the troop of UCLA footballers stops at the edge of the new exercise field on the campus of the team for conversation.
Some have scrubbed off their shirts, exposing the sweaty backs of the first day of their training camp.
For a large part of the team, these idle minutes offer a midday break.
The players participating in the summer courses head back to the dormitory for final exams after three hours of training before returning to Wasserman football centre for meetings at 6:30 the next morning.
"The next three days is a real challenge for them," said Bruins Coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel practice twice a day to reduce the burden on players has actually increased their days - at least until the final exams are completed on Friday.
For this reason, the first three training sessions of UCLA were scheduled to begin at 19.15 in order to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The transition from two trainings a day means more days with one exercise - the start of Bruins training camp was raised almost a week ahead of the previous season and for the first time during the summer courses during the six Westwood Mora seasons.
They will have 18 training sessions until 20 August before the official preparations for the opening game in September against Texas A&M begin.
According to Mora, he is in favour of a change of the NCAA's rules, even though it adds another item to the player's tight schedule.
"They have a huge burden in three or four days and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they will break through this test; they will exert themselves; they will be fine young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice."
When the camp is finished, the UCLA will make the trainings closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking lot near their squares and the adjacent Luskin Centre, a high-class hotel that has already been hit by footballs that have escaped the gatepost's surrounding safety net.
Since this weekend, Bruins players occupy the hotel, but Mora admitted that problems may arise during the free-room season.
"Picking up security," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and film training from there.
If you have a record of training, you might make a pretty good deal with it.
But we're gonna use a security team there and in parking lot eight.
We will do our best to use what we have.
I'm trying not to worry about that very much.
We have a plan in place."
The Savisaare-Ivanova electoral union, Kristiina Ojuland, who was excommunicated from the Reform Party and Maria Kaljuste who had been forced out of the EKRE, was created to pay tribute to the forces of the Central Party and to the party members of our Tallinn and the party members, Tegus Tallinn - it seems that the electoral alliances created by the initiative of the party to burn out the party's politics will participate in local elections at least as much as the political parties.
However, chicks will be counted in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there will be enough disillusioned voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisaar?
When Edgar Savisaar's support team has been reduced to a small size, he can be expected to attend events in honour of his election union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current middle party members and many unknown faces - is that the composition of the electoral union going to be?
And can the reason why some loyal followers and friends of Savisaar avoid running for office in Tallinn be looked at as being a reality for the "Saviisaar List" of the captors, led by corruption and suspected corruption crimes?
A video of music filmed on the roof of the district government to a Russian pop song, in which the parent of Lasnamäe district participates; and, in all respects, a primitive computer game in which Prime Minister Jüri Ratas has to avoid puddles and squirrels on his bike - is this the first time the Centre Party is trying to catch the votes of the elected 16- and 17-year-old voters allowed to join the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing what other parties have in mind about a youthful election campaign.
If the viewer of Channel 2 or TV3 is looking at a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV+, Tallinn TV and France24 channels can be seen in the future, or to hand over a tensome television operators each month.
There are probably also those who publicly rejoice at the unadvertised TV experience at first, but eventually - albeit reluctantly - pay for television pictures and advertisements.
The music, the noisy people, and the trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the hustle, you should go home to discover your country instead of hurting your head - and leave the sleeping place for the festival guests for a large amount of money.
Washington Changes the Rules of the Green Card
Media publications quote President Donald Trump, who says that a new US immigration plan is planned, which changes the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules on obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and the President supports them.
The bill goes to Congress in two chambers.
"This law reduces poverty, raises wages and saves billions of dollars of taxpayers' money, as it changes the way in which green cards are issued to citizens of other countries in the United States.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process gives an advantage to candidates who speak English and have the financial resources to support themselves and the skills that benefit our economy," said Trump, according to media publications in the United States.
Siberian Seto youths move to the city, pensioners return to the country.
Jevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of the famous Seto gold miners near the former Earth.
He works 140 kilometers from home at the Gold Artillery by the River Kuvai.
This is a tough job: for two consecutive months without holidays 12 hours of work and then only ten days at home and again back.
During the three years of his work at Arkelli, Anatoly has only seen gold once.
"There is a hard time: when you go in, you will be thoroughly checked not to bring vodka and, when you go out, not to bring gold," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho chatting in Haida village with the local Seto Jaan, who has told her a lot about her family memories in Siberia.
The archaic culture of the Siberian Setos, which is still preserved, will also affect the home Setos, because it is just so amazing, thinks the most thoroughly the far-off setos studied by Piho Mare.
His first research trip to Siberia is 30 years this year.
During this time, he has been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many setus traveled to Siberia in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to get land here?
This is an unresolved issue.
I'm saying 8,000.
I figured it out from the stories of the men in the Siberian Seto who have thought about it.
It is difficult to say exactly because up to 30 people could come in one group at the time, but only the man was given the passport.
The passport was given only to one but had children, sisters, and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times bigger than historical Setomaa.
It had to be cultivated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed because here they ended up in areas not only agricultural but also river (logging), gold mines, industry.
In New Petseri, for example, many setos later went to work in the classified city of Krasnoyarsk-45 (thereby the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J.P.) when it was formed.
Did Setos make up the majority of the population in this area at the time?
Yeah, they lived compactly.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and childhood long remained.
Seven or eight children in the family were common.
How much did Siberian Seto culture differ and differ from the Seto of the Motherland?
They are different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought along a lot of folk costumes.
They did so themselves (people's clothes), but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on Seto's traditional clothing, because it is colder here.
Foods changed.
In Setomaa, for example, meat was salted, but here it was simply frozen.
Where are the Siberian Setos villages and what life is there? / graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection with the motherland was spiritually strong, and it was considered to be very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back there, to influence them.
Those girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho is referring to the people of the Estonian Seto delegation who came to Haida's village in early July for the day of the Seto Kingdom and lived in their homes for four days - J. P.
What's left of it, it's amazing.
"It is very easy for Tapa to come and go, because the city has an excellent location: at the railway hub and at the intersection of the roads," says Reigo Tamm of the opera soloist from Tapa.
The city is no longer merely a military capital; we have many natures, sports and cultural sites, and pizza is available on every corner.
Kill is a top-topp city!
There's a small island through the city, near the White River, where killers tend to have a firefly.
"This beautiful place doesn't appear in the train window," Reigo smiles.
Those who are not afraid of cold water can swim in this river, for the river is full of springs.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the river's edge and just romance - you can look at the river's flow and think about life in front and behind.
I've been there for a walk with my girlfriends.
The Operativeist Tamm has been practicing his arias on the riverbank between the three bridges: "Because this place is near the city, no one will ever meet me if I hum my own stories."
"There is a wonderful view of Tapa from Männikumägi, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter, and now you can play discgolf - the golf course is done, the disks can be rented from the fitness centre," led by Reigo.
The old pros go there with their disks, of course, but I haven't gotten there yet.
It is probably necessary to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he is an experienced discgolf player and has disks.
I think he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikumägi were inseparable during the childhood of the current opera soloist.
At least during skiing hours.
There are many tears and disappointments left on this mountain, and you can win in my sports life.
Not to mention broken sleds and skis.
"The whole city downtown is now full of construction work, all of this is changing to the unknown," says Reigo.
Kill the old and tired station building, however, is a very attractive place where summer discoveries are played.
I am glad that in 2012 the leader of R.A.A.A.M. Märt Meos accepted my idea and came to the station with his theater to perform the summer theater.
Although this year's theatre season with Alexei Karenin has just ended, on 11 August there will be a "Waking Up" at the railway station when the old station building moves around in the 1980s.
"August 11-13 is the days of Tapa City, in which the home cafés open at the station building and a series of cultural events, including folk rally, have been awakened," says Reigo, who recommends visiting the 91-year-old city in those days.
In a small yellow cabin on May 1st, the museum has been in 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are very numerous and the information is huge," commends Reigo's place, full of Tapa's history, most of which focuses on railroad and military.
Reigo smiles that when Tapa passes through all the recommended places, the stomach will be hungry for a long time, but fortunately, the small town is full of cafes.
"We have such good dining places, and sitting in cafes sometimes get the feeling that you're abroad," he describes.
Educated and young soldiers from Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafes, so sitting there, it's a strange feeling that you are in Estonia and your hometown, but there's this kind of international company all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot going on!
Two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who reported that two Bulgarians were arrested in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camped people on the Sithonia Peninsula, including two Bulgarians.
They were released the same day, but an investigation is underway.
The State Department told the TV channel bTV that the Bulgarians were released later.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on anyone who is caught in a resting place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Puppies are taught by wolves to break sheep.
After a year's break, the farmers of Hiiumaa will have to give the wolves their herd "learning material" again - probably the wolves who taught the puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, the wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep in total and eight sheep injured, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, a year earlier, 124.
The environmental agency's data is also in sync with the breakouts, that there were no wolf litters born in Hiiumaa last year and information from the Hiiumaa hunting council that two wolf litters were fixed on the island this year.
On the night after Monday, the wolves broke into Emmaste's parish in Kabul village 15 sheep and injured half of the surviving 18 sheep.
Early on Wednesday morning, the wolves broke a sheep in the pasture of the village of Reheselja and badly injured another who had to be killed.
The rules for handling genetically modified crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft law amending the Genetically Modified Organisms Release Act (GMOVS) and the Plant Protection Act to the coordination circle.
The amendment to the Act will waive the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, which will use the plant health register in the future.
In addition, GM crop operator's obligation to have prior agreement within a prescribed radius with a beekeeper shall be amended.
Although genetically modified crops are currently not grown in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of genetically modified and unmodified crops.
At least until it is decided to declare Estonia free of GMOs," said Sigmar Suu, Head of Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"It must also be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burden for both the private and public sectors," added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to GM crop location and operator inventory and handling training in GMOVS, lays down requirements for the handling of GM crop and for the establishment of economic activities.
In the specific case of beekeeping, the current obligation of GM crop grower to inform beekeepers of the start of cultivation of GM crop is replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with the beekeeper before cultivation begins.
The draft law has been sent to ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult it in the draft information system and, if they so wish, to present their opinion to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The changes planned will affect in particular those active in the field of crop production, beekeepers and the Office for Agriculture.
Only one GM crop - MON 810 maize - may be grown in the European Union, including Estonia.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no corn pest in Estonia, a European stem beetle for which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line have also been developed for the southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016 the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect contamination with possible GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of Sumirapsi, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The analytical results of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain foreign genes and the study concluded that seeds of oilseed rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
From the above, in turn, it can be concluded that there is no deliberate cultivation of genetically modified crops in Estonia, and it was also confirmed that there has also been no accidental contamination.
Jose Mourinho thinks Manchester United recruited Nemanja Matic in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, after the central player against Sampdoria made his debut on Wednesday night.
A player bought over £40 million from Chelsea started to win in Dublin in the last pre-season game of United before Uefa Super Cupi Real Madrid on Tuesday 2-1 in the starting line, impressing the defence role while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attack trips.
However, having been sidelined from Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was sorely short of a match uniform, and he lasted only 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this has to be improved before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"Let's help him achieve the form as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other new recruits, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku, started out at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho started to quietly set up his starting men for the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wants to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club has already done a "excellent job" by concluding contracts with three of its four priority options.
"I am grateful to the club that they were able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'll be happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another cub got a GSM transmitter on August 1st and this time in Muhu.
According to Mati Martinson, bird-watcher in Kõrve, the first cub was equipped with an escort in Sõrves, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest site and has joined a large overnight group in the Mullutu-Great.
This is because Sõrves is not a field of grain, says the Voice of the Islands.
That Tuesday, relatively late to ring the cranes, another cucumber caught on the transmitter and it was on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a cub named Mati GSM was supplied with a transmitter called Sõrves Türjul.
"His activities are all watching on the Internet: how he went to Spain to winter, when he returned to the German and Polish border, and then came to Saaremaa," said Martinson.
The British inventor had a microchip implanted in his body to get into the house and car with hand signals.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could just open his front door by hand, get into the office, and even start a car.
33-year-old Steven Northam had a small chip fitted between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service to companies and individuals through their company BioTeq, who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr Geoff Watson, a consultant-anesthesiologist at the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester, Hants to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip applied to cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northami company will also change the locks for houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married one child's father has now installed technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost taxpayers thousands.
According to military documents released to Time magazine, the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter last month cost taxpayers a total of $24,000 to the southern yard for the American production event.
The Green and White Sikorsky VH-3D, called Marine One during the President's presence on board, was the central attraction of the American construction programme event at the White House on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of industrial products from all 50 states.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift made in Mississippi.
According to the documentation from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House's war room required a part order to be present with the helicopter, or FARGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the south yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an unusually high-profile event," the commander of HMX-1 said in an e-mail the day before the event to his superior, the deputy naval commanding officer in the field of aviation.
The message stated that the helicopter would arrive in the south yard about 7:00 p.m. on July 17th and stay there until the yard was cleared between 18:00 p.m. and 21:00 p.m. that evening.
Added was the fact that if the departure from the White House is delayed, the return flight would require a second crewing due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was by the helicopter during the event and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft throughout its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to read from the documents given to the journal TIME whether or not a second copy was finally needed.
Hatch's law prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes.
The documents show that HMX-1 examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was in violation of Hatch's law, and we were told it wasn't," the commander wrote.
"You seem to have no choice," answered the deputy chief officer.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law wouldn't have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform during the event at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of an aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them purely as a photo shoot is unusual.
Trump caught attention in February when his first campaign event in Florida, Melbourne, had a presidential plane rolling into the background, and his Twitter account was full of messages complaining about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"The White House is very pleased with the exhibition "made in America," which represented products from all 50 states made of American materials by American workers," said White House spokesperson Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 teams often conduct pilot flights around Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down the United States President's White House with an inch accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 organised 58 pilot landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight was included in the training flight standard for the "America-made" flight crew that month.
Squadron helicopters flew another 11 hours that day for non-president support missions.
According to the White House, none of the other exhibits of this event burdened the taxpayer's wallet.
According to Sikorsky's representative, the company was not involved in organising the exhibition on the southern yard of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the budget documents of the President's flights and the exact costs of the event are difficult to find out.
However, according to the hourly prices of the Ministry of Defence for the 2017 financial year, the compensation rate for VH-3D is 24 380 dollars per flight hour.
The squadron records marked the length of the flight from its main base at the Naval Quantico airport in Virginia in both directions for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is well below this amount.
"The calculation of the taxpayer's costs on the basis of the estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated compensation rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irreversible costs to be taken into account in the annual appropriations."
According to the 2015 RAND study, the Ministry of Defence does not include personnel costs but covers fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
The former White House spokesperson, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," said Spicer.
"And I know that the states of Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are probably hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that, just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it's right to highlight it."
It's not clear if Trump was exposed to a helicopter during a tour in the south yard, but he was behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump approached Sikorsky's representatives, making fun of the company's products in his personal fleet.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of their products."
Grit Shadeiko - Peace and Joy Arrived Through Tears
In 2011, MMM Daes hit Shadeiko in the last area, a 800-mile foot cramp, and a girl was taken from the stadium with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had received a zero in the distance jump of the universe held in China.
The 2012 Helsinki EM was damaged by an injury in the cheapest, but at the London debut Olympics, he received 6013 points in 23.
However, the misfortune continued.
The 2013 Moscow MM received a thumb injury after the opening day in the distance jump of the Estonian woman who was scheduled for the Estonian record.
Two years later, he received the 15th place in Beijing MM and fulfilled the Olympic standard, but that was also a disappointment to the athlete who wanted more.
The heaviest gauntlet was only passed by Shadeiko last year when he did not get the result of the distance jumping at the Amsterdam EM.
I'd just like to put together a proper multi-game once.
Once," confessed Shadeiko.
Worse was still ahead: a month later, his Olympics competition in Rio was interrupted by the first obstacle due to a femur injury.
The time had to be taken out - do you want to continue with the 7th?
Is two days of effort really worth all this?
She thought for a long time, but found peace.
I got to clear my head.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I have thought that last season and the Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Fortunately, there was time to heal and think about it.
"I knew I wouldn't put the pill in the bag yet," says Shadeiko about her self-cleaning.
I was able to turn over a clean slate and move on with a new momentum.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, the suffering of the ward was very difficult to look at, but she realized that the athlete must first and foremost find out for himself.
He was so buried by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"Grit said he wouldn't give up and he wants to prove himself what he's worth," says the Mountain.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He does it for his own pleasure.
The competition came back in May when Šadeiko set the new Estonian record at Götz.
In a high-level competition, he repaired his personal brand with a bullet-shot of nearly a metre (13.89) and ran a record time barrier run.
Then the contestant sensed that it was not the ceiling of powers, but that it was just the first hunger for competition.
Mägi, who guided him for years, says that Shadeiko is a model student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to train.
If anything hurts or is wrong, he's gonna say it now.
He knows his body and trusts his senses.
That's what we're gonna have to do.
I can't tell you exactly what to do and we'll follow it.
Shadeiko has also found a new approach.
"I'm not the kind to make the most of it at practice," he says, and he says, "The most important thing is getting the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
# The happiness of a close baby makes you happy #
Happy emotions have also served Shadeiko with the happiness of loved ones.
Both his former training partner Maris Mägi and sister Grete recently became parents and several competitors have received support from new world citizens.
"It's been quite interesting," says Shadeiko.
One alcohol the drinking of which equals brain training.
Livestrong writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes - wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the "very active" wine tasting process.
By sniffing glass, spinning wine in the mouth, enjoying it and sensing aftertaste, we put our brains to work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperd, the wine molecules do not really contain taste, but the taste comes from the way the wine stimulates the brain.
He compares the way the brain "sees" colors.
"No taste in wine, taste creates wine taster," says Sheperd.
Things that affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, our gender, and even the amount of saliva that man produces.
Sheperd, of course, admonishes me that wine is not to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take too much of a sip, the system is oversaturated.
Drinking too much wine may harm the brain instead of profiting from it - according to the 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, lose memory, lose balance, and have reduced mental ability.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector earn less than their colleagues
Data from the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector receive less than their colleagues.
Ten percent pay gap between men and women, writes the portal Genius.
59 IT and telecommunications companies participated in the pay survey of the Fontes ICT sector.
In total, 8 577 posts were under examination.
63% of the posts were occupied by men.
"Although only 3 companies stated that the pay gap was in favour of men and that there was no pay gap between the rest of the companies, in reality, compared to similar jobs, the monthly basic wage for men is on average 10% higher than that for women and the average annual pay for men is 8% higher than that for women," said Fontes' analyst Ilmar Põhjala.
Narcose 3rd season ad: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Cali cartel will be central to Netflix's hit series
Despite the discovery of the killer of Pablo Escobar in the second season of "Narcos," the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service and the first of them has already been made a commercial clip that teases the new bad guys of the series.
In season three, the DEA pays its attention to the world's richest drug trading organisation, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers "like the Fortune 500 company," simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) the brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is the leader of the cartel, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In a freshly released commercial clip, Pedro Pascali sees Javier Penana returning as a character recruiting America and Colombia to help with the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Biske and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" will be launched on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics
The UN Head of Mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local Soviet elections, three women are running for Vice-Presidentship, and more than 30 percent of voters who have recently registered are women.
"It is not possible to exaggerate the importance of the role of women," he said in a statement made on Wednesday.
Elections can only truly represent the people and be credible if women are fully involved and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
For its part, the Taliban has threatened the electoral process, which coincides with a transitional period in which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is handed over peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women in the success of democracy in Afghanistan will be enhanced.
According to the independent Afghan electoral commission, 1.2 million women out of 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything cooler for big and small people.
There's always too little time together, but training with kids is a good way to connect together, play, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - no matter where you cruised in the summer, you always have the live gongs with you, and with their tiny little voice, they're anxious to remember, "Let's work out now!"
Start heating up - it's good to have a normal game of hawks or run along the beach strip.
A squat is the foundation for keeping in the form of legs and buttocks - who would like to take the shape of a sand cake washed from the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use kids instead of bars!
First of all, it's safe and comfortable, and the weight is growing at the same rate as the trainer's strength.
Advanced ones can also squat with pretty big kids.
The child trains balance, reads repetitions, and enjoys the opportunity to chant and be important.
Bigger kids can do their own squats at the same time.
The extent of the movement is determined by touching the earth and reaching out your hands.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the mini-help to hold on tight.
The child can read repetitions and feel like a coach.
The plank is extremely useful, but for a child, a hopelessly boring exercise.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game plank: Take a long plank column to alternate through.
Heavier than usual, actually, but much more fun to do when you can shake hands with a friend.
To add weight, you can stay in a crash, on a small back, and walk around in that position.
A minor child may be seated on his hips as an extra weight, but this exercise is fun for all children.
While the crabs crawl in the sand, the triceps, buttocks, and abdominal muscles are burdened like a snack.
The child descends on his feet so that his body weight distributes equally forwards and backwards.
You can hold hands for security.
Bend your legs and stretch straight up.
The kid can fly, have fun, train balance and be a challenge.
Little coach's life is extra fun when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
It's an extra load to stretch your legs out.
Make sure your back stays neutral.
Children themselves have a lot more fun to do in pairs and claps.
Handjob and heartbeat squad.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in a neutral position.
All children's favorite and big fun!
For the parent, however, a truly effective whole body exercise.
The sports facilities were Ott (10), Säde (8), Luck (4).
From the Philippines to the wide world, or Shoulder Bag, to the heart of fashion fans
Beer-lined bags are a summer classic that has become a single hit product in recent years, which one of the right summer runners has to hang on his hand and which, despite its modest origin, has been able to weld a price tag suitable for a hit.
A beer - woven bag is likely to be one of those things that have existed every time in life and that possessing it has not caused much emotion.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, then nothing's broken.
Now, however, shoulders are making a real victory, and fashion fans have changed their fancy designer bags for the summer months instead of for simple straw braided bags.
It is not only a beach bag, but it is also just as popular as a street bag today, and the bravest women even walk into the office with it.
Here, however, it is worth noting whether a summer look like this is sitting on the boss's seat or whether it is worth pushing a marmot and laptop to a slightly more formal sumadan.
The variety of straw bags, however, has made women's true love for summer.
For example, by reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing to notice is that fashion gourmets rush on holiday to the local market and buy themselves a bag of shoulders, which they are faithful to for a whole holiday and that comes with the beach, the market, and also their friends hanging out on the city.
Some bloggers are so generous that they buy more bags from the market and sell them or give them away to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting that there is so much demand among readers for bags that in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand-on-hand on each other to become the happy owner of a bag.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because rarely are those times when in the fashion world it is possible to buy a hit-status item for just a few dozen euros.
It is true that clever merchants have also discovered a simple way of earning money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and thousands of euros.
Probably just so richer customers don't have to feel like just mortals promening around with some cheap bags.
For example, you can buy a Dolce & Gabbana shoulder bag worth over a thousand euros.
Chanel's shoulder bag interpretation, however, can be worth €6,000.
Unlike most fashion designers, however, shoulders do not come from a few big fashion sets, but their story began from farther away.
It is claimed that the straw bags come from a far - reaching Philippines, where they have spread to the wider world.
Banging a bag of beer is mostly an exorcism, and the locals don't often see it going around with them.
Supposedly, the straw technique dates back to the 14th century and is quite Sarane with the usual basket-browing.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be as tight as the basket, it is possible to embed in it the patterns and other materials that make the bag more personal and actrative.
For example, recently there are particularly trendy bags with woven coloured ribbons or leather strips.
The letter of gratitude can be sent primarily to actress Jane Birkin, of whom the biggest braided shoulder bag fan had not been seen before.
In fact, he adapted the bag of shoulders to all kinds of sets of clothing and did not consider it much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
The popularity of the bags today is not limited by the fact that care for them is a cockhead and, unlike any other sumadan, they do not have to be cared for by special means, but also by water and a wet towel.
As usual for trends, since the classic look, brands have come up with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, if you wish, you can buy a straw - braided raspberry or a tiny shoulder bag.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that a classic shoulder bag never goes out of fashion, but a shoulder bag does.
But what's the classic shoulder bag?
For centuries, a bag of straw that resembles a basket in its style has been considered classic, is open from the top and is short, as well as straw, handles.

GMB is worried about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant
The union expects the cookie manufacturer McVitie's managers to confirm long-term production plans at the company's Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has remained silent about the future of the Tollcross investment.
The factory, where Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products are produced, employs more than 500 people.
The owner of McVitie's Pladis said that they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the object over the last few years.
More employees were hired there and union leaders "are the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's activities.
In a letter sent to the company's object manager, GMB Scotland asked McVitie to "dissolve concerns about the fact that the financing was not used to modernise production lines'.
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we do not get clarity from the head of the subject about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is deeply worrying about our members.
A number of generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely made up of the local community and people around Glasgow, as an essential pillar for ensuring decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation.
Therefore, in view of the jobs, wages and well-being of the east of Glasgow, Brexit, the increase in living expenses and the chronic decline in production, the company in McVitie is in dire need of a thriving return."
Pladis's representative said: "The Tollcross object manager only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company responds directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, there was a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives in Tollcross, where a number of issues were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - in order to ensure our competitiveness.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in Tollcross's object, most of which have gone into production lines and improvements to operations.
We fully understand the legacy of Tollcross as a production site, and should any changes occur in its activities, workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it."
Did the PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about its approach to Neymar?
La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratt
Paris Saint-Germain is not giving up trying to lure Neymar into his ranks by making an offer of GBP 189 million to buy him out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago about this record conquest?
This holistic approach has opened the summer transition window and the Ligue 1 club is ready to break more than twice the current world record of over-purchase, which was erected last season with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will as a result become the world's most expensive player and, at the same time, the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, who will be paid more than 500 000 pounds a week after payment from PSG.
Barcelona is, of course, angry about both the approach and the break-in of Neymar, although a source close to the board of Catalans confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the president of the PSG warn the football world about this opportunity three years ago?
In 2014, when Manchester City showed interest in signing a contract with Blaise Matudi, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting one of the best players in the PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll face them and contact them," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they're trying to make a deal with one of our players, they're gonna have to face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line because the Spanish club showed interest earlier this summer in PSG's central player Marco Verratt.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italians to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could be recoiled as a result of this interest, losing one of its precious assets in Neymar's form.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brex is seriously threatened with a wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," Varadkar warned at the first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: to build bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union and, as it cannot, to remain a part of the European single market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's departure smoother would be to create a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'We could certainly have such an agreement with Britain'.
The alternative would be to return to customs points that would declare historical divisions and political failure.
'The barrier to trade, prosperity and peace', said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit "the challenge of our generation" and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's everyday life.
The Irish Prime Minister met with the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland during his visit to Belfast.
With his first half-long triathlon passed Märt Avandi: Ironman can be passed by anyone.
Today, Otepää, the winter capital, held the largest triathlon festival in the Baltics, when about a thousand triathlets from over thirty countries took place in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70.3 miles consisted of 1.9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling, and 21.1 km of cycling.
Among others, Märt Avandi, the first triathlon, triumphantly ended his life.
"I thought it would be difficult and eventually it was difficult," said Avandi in the finish line.
Despite the complexity, Avandi admitted that the triathlon is actually feasible for almost everyone.
"Not distance kills, but pace kills," he said, implying that almost everyone gets to the finish line at an affordable rate.
Except Ott Sepp: "Oti's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working out since February.
First four to five hours a week, then ten hours a week.
With time 05:34:12, he reached 270th place in general.
Although Avandi lost both to Raio Piiroja (time 04:59:53) and to Jürgen Ligil (time 05:06:37), he won other rivals in the so-called "prominent class."
Last year, Tanel Padar, who was a "good example for the person," lost to Avandi in seven minutes (time 05:41:54), journalist Sten Teppan in 16 minutes (time 05:50:23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06:31:53 and 06:45:18).
The German Johannes Moldan was crowned the overall winner of the men of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series at 3:58:27; the best of the Estonians was Ivo the Great with 04:14:09.
Among the women, the Dane Helle Frederiksen triumphed with the time of 04:24:01, while the Estonians were Maria Rabbit, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and was given the time of 04:58:58.
The avalanche passed a 1.9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in a 410th position.
