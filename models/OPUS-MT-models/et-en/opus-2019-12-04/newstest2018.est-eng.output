Four members of the Kemerovo group were detained in Estonia and Spain
According to the postman, in Spain, the police detained Slava Gulevich, the leader of the so-called Kemerovo group operating in the Estonian underworld, known in the criminal world as Slava Kemerovsky.
Gulevich, who was detained in Spain, was arrested with the authorisation of the court.
Yesterday, the court also arrested three suspects who were detained in Estonia.
It is suspected that this is the so-called Kemerovo criminal organisation, aged 27-57, which is mainly committing drug crimes.
In Mijas, Malaga province, Spain, the alleged leader of a criminal organisation was detained.
Three men were apprehended as suspects in Estonia, one of whom, according to the collected data, is the leading figure of a criminal organisation and two are members of a criminal organisation.
The data collected suggest that there was a clear division of tasks and roles in a criminal organisation.
The purpose of the criminal organisation was to commit drug offences and thus to generate proceeds from criminal activities, "commented the Chief of the pre-trial proceedings on the case, Public Prosecutor Vahur Verte.
"We do not rule out that the circle of suspects in the case in question is increasing," added the prosecutor.
These are people who have been caught up in law enforcement in the past, and some of them have been punished for drug offences.
Verte stressed that cooperation with Spanish colleagues has been important throughout the investigation.
"International cooperation has become common to us, and this week's operation shows the success of this cooperation," said Prosecutor Verte.
The head of the Central Criminal Police Department, Ago Leis, said that detention was preceded by a preliminary investigation of almost one and a half years.
"In the first half of the week, long-term work became realistic, and at the same time we intercepted suspicious crimes in Estonia and Spain," he said.
He added that the officers of the Central Criminal Police were assisting in detention in Spain.
For years now, we have had good contact and understanding with the Spanish police and the Civil Guard.
These detentions are yet another message to criminals that we can catch them from another end of Europe, "Leis said.
The information collected so far clearly indicates that, while men who have been found to be at liberty, they may continue to commit new crimes, which is why the prosecution requested their arrest and was approved by the court.
The man arrested in Spain awaits his surrender to Estonia.
Real estate, vehicles and cash have been seized to ensure confiscation in this case.
The pre-trial proceedings in criminal matters are conducted by the Office for Crime Organised by the Central Criminal Police and managed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
The City Court of Tallinn sentenced Slava Gulevich to blackmail in 2005 and punished him with five years of imprisonment.
In the middle of the last decade, Gulevichi was regarded as the second most important man in the criminal world of Estonia, after the then underworld leader Nikolai Tarankov.
Gulevich, from Kemerovo, emerged in the underworld of Estonia in the early 1990s when he started extorting in Tallinn.
He claimed to tax taxi drivers and prostitutes operating in various hotels and to charge business men a monthly fee on the roof.
International joint operations, confiscation of proceeds of crime and court rulings in force confirm that the fight against organised crime is effective.
For example, the latest judgments, the eight indictments of the so-called Dikayev criminal organisation, from which the proceeds of the crime were confiscated EUR 80 000, or the judgment against nine persons that Igor Aleynikov established a criminal organisation in 2006 aimed at the illicit trafficking of contraband cigarettes and the commission of crimes related to trafficking in human beings in East-Viru County and South Estonia.
The amount of criminal proceeds confiscated there is close to EUR 71 500.
In these cases, it has been a success that police officers exchange information and evidence with foreign colleagues every day, and that, if necessary, actions are taken together in any European Union country.
Civil Rights Group warns against travelling to Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has warned against the discriminatory state policies and racist attacks of black people travelling to Missouri.
According to the statement of the group: "The NACP travel note issued by the State of Missouri, valid until 28 August 2017, calls on all African-American passengers, visitors and Missouri to be particularly attentive and extremely careful when moving around the whole state, taking into account the suspicious race-based events that have taken place recently across the state and have been highlighted here."
According to NAACP, the group was encouraged to issue a travel warning, not only by the recent Missouri law, which makes it more difficult to win cases of discrimination, but also by the fact that the targets of state law enforcement are, to an unequal extent, minorities.
"People's civil rights are being violated.
They are pulled to the edge of the road because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said President Rod Chapel of the NACP Missouri branch on The Kansas City Star.
"We've never received complaints this closely before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization for the US state.
The group referred to events such as racist insults towards black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old black Tennessee.
Sanders died earlier this year under dubious circumstances after he ran out of gas driving through the state, and the Missouri police took him into custody without being charged with a crime.
In addition, the comment refers to a report recently prepared by the Prosecutor General of Missouri which shows that black drivers are 75% more likely to stop cars in the state than white drivers.
"The note is intended to make people aware and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People must be prepared, whether it means taking bail or informing relatives that they pass through the state."
On the basis of the latest information from the FBI's hate crime reporting programme, 100 hate crimes were documented in Missouri in 2015, which places 16 in the country's cross-section in terms of the number of violations similar to the state.
The travel warning is also in response to the new Missouri law, which makes it difficult to sue a company for discrimination in the search for housing or work.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had previously issued travel notes on Texas and Arizona following the adoption of immigration laws by these states, which obliged local authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, as ACLU said this increases racial profiling.
Usually travel warnings are issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on other countries, but recently stakeholders have started to use this measure as a response to certain internal laws and trends in the US.
Hepatitis: what could anyone know about the different forms of this serious disease?
Hepatitis or inflammation of the liver may be caused by five different hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses.
All of these viruses cause acute inflammation of the liver tissue.
However, there is chronic hepatitis B and C, which may further develop into cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
The Epidemiological Advisor to the Health Board, Kuulo Kutsar, says that the symptoms of acute hepatitis are the same for all types of inflammation of the liver - fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, greyish stools, dark urine, muscle and joint pain, and yellowing of the skin and mucous membranes.
The last sign of the disease is also due to the popular name of the liver infection yellow disease.
In children, hepatitis may progress without symptoms.
Different types of inflammation of the liver can only be identified from laboratory data.
Acute hepatitis may be converted to chronic hepatitis and continue for decades without symptoms, which means that a person may not know about his or her dangerous liver disease.
Kuulo Kutsar points out different forms of hepatitis and describes their course in greater detail.
Hepatitis A viruses spread from sick people and infect us by eating contaminated food or drinking water, through sex, from infected people's stool to hands and hands to food, surfaces, objects, oral contact and drug use.
The risk / risk group for hepatitis A is family members and carers of the sick, people with chronic liver disease, people having sex with the infected, men having sex with men, drug addicts, travellers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis A.
Vaccination can be prevented by vaccination, in particular vaccination is recommended for people who are highly travelling and at risk of hepatitis A infection.
In addition, daily hygiene requirements are important: wash or disinfect your hands, wash all fruit and vegetables before eating.
Hepatitis B viruses spread to the affected person when exposed to blood, injecting drugs, tattooing, piercing, using blood-contaminated domestic objects (toothbrushes, shaving products), donor blood, having sex with a suspected person, and from the hepatitis patient to the foetus / newborn.
The highest risk group for hepatitis B infection is injecting drug users, infected people's sex partners, men having sex with men, newborn infected mothers, sick family members and carers, health care workers, rescue workers and police officers in contact with blood and other body fluids, and passengers visiting countries with high levels of hepatitis B disease.
Vaccination is possible to prevent hepatitis B; in particular, it is recommended to vaccinate people at risk, as well as people with chronic liver disease, HIV infection, sexually transmitted diseases and diabetes.
Other preventive measures for hepatitis B include: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharp devices and syringe-needles, tattoos and piercing, and using a condom in the event of infectious sex or preventing sexual risk behaviour.
Vaccination against hepatitis B is part of the national immunisation plan in Estonia and free of charge for children.
Hepatitis C viruses spread to the mother / newborn of a sick person when they come into contact with blood, injected into drugs, tattooed, pierced, exposed to blood, donated blood, having sex with a suspected person, and from the hepatitis patient to the foetus / newborn.
The risk group for hepatitis C infection includes injecting drug users, infected people's sex partners, men having sex with men, newborn infected mothers, sick family members and carers, health care workers and police officers exposed to blood and other body fluids, persons infected with HIV and travellers visiting countries with high hepatitis C.
The prevention measure for hepatitis C is: avoiding the use of foreign hygiene and manicure equipment, other sharp devices and needle injection, tattoos and piercing, and use of condoms in the event of infectious sex.
There is no vaccine against hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is caused by the hepatitis D virus that is multiplying in the presence of hepatitis B virus.
Because of this, hepatitis D infection occurs with hepatitis B or as a superinfection in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Hepatitis D viruses are spread in contact with blood and other body fluids, syringes and needles contaminated with them, sexually transmitted and infrequently infected from mother to foetus.
The risk group for hepatitis D is chronic hepatitis B virus carriers and non-immune individuals against hepatitis B.
An effective preventive measure is vaccination with hepatitis B vaccine, which also protects people against hepatitis D virus infection.
Hepatitis E viruses spread via the femoral route to drinking water and food, including low heat-treated beef, fish and shellfish, donor blood, common-use syringes and infected mother-to-foetus.
Passengers may be infected in countries with high levels of hepatitis E.
For prevention measures for hepatitis E, hygiene requirements are met: wash or disinfect your hands after using the toilet, before cooking and eating, after caring for the patient.
Wash fruit and vegetables before consumption, avoid eating little heat-treated beef, fish and seafood, drink only safe drinking water and avoid drug use.
Although on the last round the competitors tried to get the four-time Olympic champion off the track, Farah, a 34-year-old, at the end, found strength and won 26.49,51.
Farah didn't think long, pulling his wife, Tania, and the children along with him after the finish.
It was a special moment for me.
I miss my family so much.
Being on the track with them was wonderful, "Farah said to the journalists.
Farah is aiming at the fifth title contest in London for 5,000 and 10,000-meter running gold doubles.
Anything is possible if you believe in it.
Despite the title, Anne-Marie O'Connor's "Lady in Gold. Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait," dives much deeper than the story of the birth of a work of art in the culture of Vienna at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century.
But even more in history.
It would have cost an awe-inspiring amount of information, perhaps a harder kill axe, and a narrower topic would have allowed the exceptional story of the portrait promised in the title to get more effect.
It is now like two books between some covers: the story of Adele Bloch-Bauer depicted by Gustav Klimt and his painting "The Lady in Gold," and a much more comprehensive and comprehensive history book about respected Jewish families and the German occupation with its aftermath in Austria.
The first third of the book takes the cultural life of Vienna in the middle of a bubbling city, and who himself entered the capital of Austria can hardly imagine how life was around Ringstrasse more than a hundred years ago, or how everyone turned their heads in the cafe of Central when Klimt walked in.
The concentration of cultural characters was high in one of Europe's richest cities, and seeing the name familiar in the book makes you feel more cultured.
However, for example, the fact that Sigmund Freud was active in a city where the irreparable syphilis and the highest level of suicide in Europe were raging, as if there was nothing more to do with the development of the story.
Or perhaps - every pairing brush pull adds colours to the cultural life of the early 20th century in Vienna.
Dream of a trip to the Soviet Union
In the last decades of the 19th century, the number of Jews had exploded in Vienna, becoming the largest Jewish community in Western Europe.
On the turn of the century, almost one in ten residents of Vienna were Jewish.
Adèle's parents were newcomers in Vienna, but by the time Adele married twice to open up to the Czech sugar magnate Ferdinand Bloch and posed for Klimt for his famous paintings, his father's bank had already become the seventh largest bank in the Habsburg Empire.
But Adele didn't pull the whole glamorous life she belonged to.
When you look at "Lady in Gold," it's hard to believe that, at the end of life, this great lady became infected with socialism and dreamed of a trip to the Soviet Union.
By 1903, when Ferdinand Bloch decided to order his husband's portrait from Klimt, the last moment was the hottest painter in Vienna.
Klimt ordered 4000 kroons at the time, a quarter of the price of a country house with a good location.
The fact that in some portraits, the master's affair with the model was suspected, the sugar magnate was not intimidated.
As far as Adele is concerned, the only sure fact is that the close relationship between the model and the artist developed during the work continued for the rest of his life.
Anne-Marie O'Connor - "Lady in gold.
Gustav Klimt's masterpiece, Adele Bloch-Bauer's portrait of an extraordinary story, "Varrak 2016, translated by Aldo Randmaa from English.
Just before the beginning of his work with Adele, Klimt had been in the basilica of Ravenna San Vitale, and investigators think that it was the brilliant mosaics seen there that gave the artist the idea of making a golden portrait of Adele as a painted mosaic.
Klimt presented his "Lady in Gold" in Vienna in 1908 and around the same time (from 1907 to 1908) was born another golden painting called "Kiss."
The art historians did not miss the resemblance of two women.
What's the story about Hitler?
"I think that, in memory of my friend Klimt, I owe him to make his handiwork available to the public," Adele Bloch-Bauer wrote to the director of the Belvedere Museum a few years after the artist left (Klimt died in February 1918) and wished their family's Klimt collection to go to the museum.
Six years before he died, Klimt had made another portrait of Adele.
Also in his will (Adele left in February 1925) he asked her to leave her two portraits and four paintings of Gustav Klimt landscape to the Austrian Gallery.
His jewels were passed on to his niece Maria and Luis.
One year after Klimt graduated from the Austrian Mona Lisa, he had tried to get to the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts by 17-year-old Adolf Hitler, but failed the drawing test.
Although, at times, Hitler's later anti-Semitism is considered to be the reason that Jewish professors did not accept him at the academy, none of his examiners were actually Jewish.
In any case, the task of the Austrian Galerii, referred to in Maria's will, had changed considerably by 1939 - it had become important to find works that were acceptable to the Nazi party of the rich Jewish art collections in Vienna.
Hitler's personal art possessions included some of Adele's homework, but not Klimt's.
Sixty years after the Nazi art robbery, a ten-year trial began between the Austrian Government and the heirs of the Bloch-Bauer.
It should be noted here that if "Kiss" is seen in Vienna in the castle of Belvedere, then Adele Bloch-Bauer in Lady's Gold must be seen to the New York Neue Gallery.
And before you go to Vienna, read the book above.
Even if you don't plan on going to see Klimt's work, because at least my emotions turned around after the book was closed more Nazi and Jewish than 135 million dollars' worth of painting and model Adele Bloch-Bauer.
So not so much a portrait as a family fatality and a very touching story.
The Bauer family tree at the beginning of the book significantly facilitated the orientation of events.
17-year-old swimmer was very close to the Estonian record in Canada
Gold was very close to his 200 m back-swimming personal record when swimming 2.16.62.
The top mark dates from a 17-year-old girl a week ago, when the Canadian Junior Championship became 2.16.58, the Priit Aavik Swimming Blog.
Gold was the last to get into the A-finals, maybe the tenth.
In the final, he passed at a distance of 2.15.76 and achieved a good seventh place with a new powerful stamp.
Alina Kendzior's Estonian record (2.15.13) was left to separate Gold for just over half a second.
Gold became third in Estonia's all-time ranking, and its new personal top mark is the fifth ever-ever result of Estonia.
Young hope for the future is still taking off at the Canadian Adult Championships in 100 m, 200 m and 400 m of free drive and 200 m and 400 m of complicity.
Last week, the Canadian Junior Championship took place in Toronto, and Gold made a successful start there.
He won a 200-meter free drive silver medal with a time of 2.03,22.
So quickly this distance was flooded by the Estonian woman last in 2008.
More quickly than ever, Elina Partyka, the Estonian record dog, has been swimming this distance in Estonia.
The Estonian woman who lives in Canada still won a bronze medal in 100 m free mood with an excellent personal record and a brand of the new Estonian season 56.66.
For example, Kertu Ly Alnek, a year older than her, has swam this distance only one hundredth faster.
He reached his own top mark in a 100-meter-flat swim, receiving a message-swimming opening shift from the time of 1.03,69.
At half the long distance, he only reached seventh place when he swam in the final 2.17.31.
Gold is currently leading the Estonian season's ranking at four different distances.
President Trump goes on vacation, critics sharpen his teeth.
It is time for the holidays - it also means relaxation for the President of the United States, Donald Trump.
However, since Trump has been one of the most vacations ever taken out by the President, critics are already sharpening their teeth.
According to US Today and CNN, the president's plan is to spend 17 days at a golf club called Bedminster in New Jersey.
Although the President's vacation started yesterday, the topic of vacation against Trump has already been spoken about for a week.
They're throwing too much rest at Trump.
It is the President's custom to spend weekends in his villas in Florida, Virginia and New Jersey.
By the way, Trump is not the most rested president in his 196 days of office.
George W. Bush, for example, has been on vacation for 67 days, while Barack Obama is only half as short as Trump, only 21 days.
But Trump does seem to forget things quickly.
The days after becoming president, Trump said on the show "60 minutes" that there would be no time for long vacations during the time of his author, because a great deal needs to be done.
He also expressed his displeasure at Barack Obama's vacation three years ago.
The current president wrote on Twitter at the time: "While Obama is on vacation, playing golf, attending parties and jazz concerts, ISIS is beheading journalists."
According to the White House officials, a 17-day golf club visit is not exactly a relaxation.
This is officially referred to as working time, during which Trump does not have time for reading or other favourite activities.
In addition, there had to be another reason for working time.
In particular, in the west wing of the White House, the air conditioning system is being replaced and therefore all personnel had to leave it.
The Oval Office and other offices of the President are also located in the West Wing.
"I don't think any of you would want to be in the west wing in August if it's 38 degrees and there's no air conditioning," said Lindsay Walters, the White House speaker, who stressed that the President would continue to work on vacation.
From where President Trump spends the next 17 days, you'll get an idea of the video.
Blocking critics from Facebook do not apply to the state office if you do not tolerate the criticism of voters
Our country's father knew a lot about the adverse media coverage.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take the papers long to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, upset him.
But he didn't shut up his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said that "freedom of speech can be taken away from us and, in silence, we can be led to the slaughter like sheep."
It brings me to Larry Hogan, the governor of Maryland, who has to work hard to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates have blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And towards the beginning of the week, the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU therefore sued him.
The governor's clerk made the case null and void, and the web comments were filled with reactions in the "Who cares?" style.
"It's just Facebook," many said.
But it does matter.
And it matters especially when it comes to a man like Hogan.
This is an amazingly popular Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state.
His approval rate is the second highest among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not an unthoughtfully reactive hothead.
He has led the state firmly and remained firmly committed to his principles.
In addition, he has used Facebook quite skilfully as a key tool in communicating with his constituents, presenting his bald head for the first time since chemotherapy, for example.
Thus, the Governor's site, which is a public forum with official labelling, is managed by personnel employed by taxpayers' dollars, is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous to block people visiting.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the Hogan spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's behaviour, claiming that blocking comments was nothing more than moderating.
But it's too easy to paint a picture of Internet trolls, junk mailers or people full of anger on the web.
The Post was talking to several real people that Hogan blocked.
And that's what they are, real people who communicate with their elected leaders, teacher, owner and pastor, not Internet trolls.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not obscene at all.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, oppressing Hogan's Catholicism.
The lawyer from Maryland Bowie, Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, did not incite anger, but real hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes or other recent news," he wrote The Post's news story in the commentary section.
"I also do not like the idea that when many people comment on the same subject, some immediately call it indifferent collective effort rather than recognising that it is a large number of concerned citizens."
What the governor's clerk called a "targeted spam attack" would probably be called "public support."
The Facebook era makes it easy to match messages by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the old days, when, to do the same, workers had to be sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arrest protestors and force them to remain silent.
But that's exactly what's happening right now, just digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for making Facebook and other social media toothless.
President Trump has sued Twitter users who have blocked him from Twitter.
One of the first judgements of marked significance on this subject was made last week in Virginia.
U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris, Alexandria, has ruled that the chairman of the Loudoun County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment to the Constitution when he blocked the voter from his Facebook page.
In Kentucky, ACLU also visited Governor Matt Bevin (R) for using Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington, affordable postal costs had the same effect as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800 quadrupled the number of newspapers and anonymous writing writers trashed his leadership.
And even then, Washington had to face anonymous trolls.
People wrote letters to the newspapers under pseudonyms like Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius, making Washington's decisions to the ground.
According to historical documents collected as part of the web-based George Washington mail collection project, his office was buried in petitions criticising his views on friendship, trade and shipping agreements with Britain.
But he didn't make them shut up.
Freedom of expression, dissenting opinions and debates are the pillars of our country.
And proper management means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes on the comfort of the home territory of the Renaissance Club
Former European front number Ronan Rafferty hopes for comfort in his home territory for the next three days when the 25th Scottish Senior Open takes place on the golf course of the East Lothian Renaissance Club.
The North Irish, who was in the lead on the next round of the Archerfield Links in the neighbourhood last year, ahead of Paul Eales, has been fond of the new venue and is acting as a tournament ambassador instead of the founder and CEO of the club Jerry Sarvad.
"I saw the Renaissance Club built, and now we see the club shine in full glory with this event," said Rafferty.
"Players see the path in their best form, it's in a brilliant state.
Jerry's done an excellent job building this place.
He's an eager supporter of the golf game and he's proud of what he's done here.
This will make it possible to present the track perfectly. "
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending the championship for the first time, even though he has won both European Touril and European Challenge Touril during his 32-year career.
"It is accompanied by a very special feeling," said the nesting player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend my Extremadura Openi title because it was taken off my competition calendar a year later.
It's magic to come back to this neighborhood.
This is a great place to play golf.
I remember the memories of last year. For me and my wife Sharon, last year's victory was special.
It was a very special time that we will always carry in our hearts. "
Gary Orr, who joined the Senior European Tour towards the beginning of the year when he was 50, returns to the competition on the ground of his homeland.
This is his first event in Scotland after taking part in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It is always a little more meaningful to play at home," said the man of Helensburgh, Orr.
"You want to perform well, but you also feel extra tension.
I've enjoyed playing again, and I've shown you a pretty decent golf game.
I'm happy with the way things have been going so far. "
The Trio joins the former winner of the Masters tournament Ian Woosnam and the senior tour champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are two out of six Scots in competition, the rest being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free of charge and parking costs 5 pounds for a car with one passenger and 10 pounds for a car with two or more passengers.
All revenue goes to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's golden land
If Bardina Degey's cooking dinner, she won't use the stove.
He even rarely uses a pot.
In the wooden cabin in the capital of Paniai regentkonna Paniai in the province of Papua, Indonesia, the housewife places the bar called nota directly in the local language in the place of fire.
In half an hour, a charred mule will be taken from the fire and eaten eagerly with unwashed hands.
Degey sits on a mud floor with no furniture, and right there, he does his daily chores, for example, washing the laundry with fuzzy water from a nearby sex.
The role of the toilet is performed by a bucket in a room without a roof.
Since he's the youngest of his husband's four women, he's not meant to take care of any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
However, working late can be dangerous for most of the village's men are unemployed and many of them drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one dares to visit after five o'clock in the evening," he says.
It is a rare glimpse of life in Papua Highlands, a former Dutch colony that was merged into Indonesia in 1969 after a referendum that caused controversy, in which only 1026 elderly people were forced to vote in front of the occupying troops.
The Dutch movement, which encouraged the liberation from the rule of the rule, quickly directed its rage against the Jakarta government, which is still keeping the region under its strong control, avoiding foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, so that independent Papua New Guinea left the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is an equally distant and deserted place. To get here from the capital of the province of Jayapura, you have to fly 90 minutes to Nabiress and then go through the five-hour journey that makes the rental car nauseous.
No public transport.
The city, with about 19 000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and covered by wavy iron roofs whose rust has turned different tones into yellowish brown.
Very few Indonesian people have taken the journey here, not to mention journalists, and there have been hardly any foreigners.
Before the Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago's baboons worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
'We were not used to wearing clothes like this, 'says Degey, referring to her colorful hand-woven turban, a dark blouse and a bright skirt.
"Before that, we only wore plant leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line, and infant mortality and illiteracy statistics are one of the worst in Asia.
But it's also a land of Indonesian gold.
Just 100 km from Paniai, a mountainous province of some 153 000 inhabitants in New Jersey, is the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran, which operates in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Freeport extracted around USD 3.1 billion of gold and copper from here.
In addition, Papua can be proud of the supply of commercial wood, which is estimated at USD 78 billion.
However, these riches are the source of the suffering of the Papua people, as they result in the suffocating presence of a powerful Indonesian army.
The New York Times 2005 study showed that Freeport paid local military and military units around USD 20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to USD 150 000 for one officer.
Papua's efforts to ensure greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ruthlessly carried over.
According to human rights activists, more than 500 000 baboons have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have raped, tortured and imprisoned the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killing in the 1970s in the highlands belonging to the Papua tribes was a measure of genocide.
Last year alone, over 3900 peaceful protestors were arrested by the Indonesian police in the region.
The 2016 report of the archdiocese of Birsbane, entitled 'We lose everything', contains statements of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture (according to another report, rape and electrocution are particularly common) and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"The number of victims is difficult to count because such incidents occur weekly," says Human Rights Watch Indonesian investigator Andreas Harsono.
The screws have been turned even harder because Papua's natural resources have caused the influx of new settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
83% of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province are Christians, but demography is changing because Muslim economic migrants are arriving from the large Indonesian islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawes.
Java family canteens sell gado-gado with crunchy and mixed vegetables, served with peanut sauce.
The locals can't compete with them.
"Migrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local papuas," explains Abeth You, the 24-year-old born in Paniai, who moved to Jayapura, the capital of the province on behalf of work.
"Native baboons papua mama-mamas [women] therefore lose their market share."
President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, who is known as Jokow among the people, promised in his 2014 election campaign to address these inequalities and human rights violations in Papua.
The former carpenter won on his way to Jakarta's presidential palace in Papua from 29 constituencies in 27, including Paniai.
But Papua has changed very little and the locals feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken, because in 2014 we voted for Jokow in anticipation of fulfilling our hopes of restoring justice," says you.
In fact, Paniai struggled only two months after Jokow took office in October.
On 7 December 2014, 11 children sang carols by the fire in Enarotal, when two Indonesian soldiers appeared on a motorcycle out of the darkness.
The frightened kids told them they should turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Yavedt Tebai, one of the soldiers insulted their tone of voice and returned later with four soldiers.
According to the victims and witnesses, drunk soldiers chased the kids and beat them with their guns' handles.
Then one of the soldiers shot among the children.
A child, a 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so cruelly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, a nearby election commission building was set on fire and the next day, things escalated further.
About 1000 young Papua men, women and children gathered to claim justice in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and presented the waita dance of the Papua mee pago tribe, during which they ran around and simulated the bird song.
Some protestors started throwing rocks at the police and the military.
In the wake of the evil mind, an order was sent to the soldiers on the inside radio. "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," was said according to an official document that has been seen by Time magazine, but which has not been issued to local media publications.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the mayor of the Kego Koto district of Enarotal, felt the threat and called for peace to be maintained, asking the people to go home.
No one wanted to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in the left wrist," he said to TIME magazine in his bright colors on the porch of the tree house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but she says the bullet came from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
"There was a lot of people, there were lots of shots," adds him.
The local man, Alfius Youw, has been shot three times by his cousin.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said TIME, in the dark Yohanes magazine, who, like many Ingoneans, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead..." I kissed him. "
Chief Inspector Yotje Mende of the Papua Police said to the reporters that his subordinates only ensured the safety of their precinct because it was attacked.
'We must defend ourselves if we are threatened with killing, 'said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, a spokesperson for the Papua police in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and many injured.
News of the killings didn't arrive in Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, where he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and promised to deal with the abuses that took place in Papua.
"I want to solve this case now so it will never happen again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said that he would put in place an out-of-court mechanism to deal with the crimes against human rights committed.
But almost immediately, the excuses followed.
"Most of the crimes happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to solving these crimes, but we must follow certain processes, "he said.
Speaking to Time on 5 June in Jakarta, however, Wiranto withdrew his words saying that he had no intention of creating a mechanism to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything is settled by law."
Wiranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of crimes against human rights involving the death of more than 1000 people in the bloody referendum on independence in East Timor in 1999, said that 11 crimes against human rights have already been resolved in Papua, including what happened in Pania.
The families of Paniai's victims accepted such claims with grim mistrust.
"I have been interrogated four times in the last three years, but no progress has been made," said Yohanes.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the opinion that Paniai's people were afraid to detonate this incident.
He said he got beat up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After burying the bodies, the army came looking for me," he says.
The shootings haven't stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the Near Regency of Paniai in Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 injured, including children, when the battle between the villagers and the head of the construction company who refused to transport the unconscious man to the hospital.
This man, the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned in a river near to fish, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested at the construction site in front of the company's office.
According to the police, the villagers threw rocks at the police, and the latter responded with warning shots.
But according to the locals, a mobile brigade (Indonesian military police) started shooting at the people, killing one person.
'We were in a big panic, we were afraid of revenge, 'said Time, 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital, and saw the injured carried in.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the police officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the region.
Paniai has always been a troubled place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of meaningful development feeds the discontent of the honey, the Mon, the Dani, and the Damal tribes of Papua, which are in the nurturing middle highlands.
Many of them have joined the Free Papua Movement (VPL) army of rebels, which, according to them, protects the rights of baboons by organising occasional attacks and kidnappings among Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the leaders of the VPL come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, under the pretext of 'defending the sovereignty of the state', the army has arrested over the last few years in Paniai and arbitrarily detained thousands of people.
Some of them will never show up again.
Pania is known among Papua people as a "tragic forgotten place."
Poverty feeds discontent.
The few rice sold in Enarotal is too expensive to buy for the locals.
Bread is just as unattainable.
People grow all their food by themselves mainly from sweet potatoes, plus a little fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each capable of maintaining four or five Battery fields.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, the rest selling on the local market.
Ten bars only cost 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the indigenous papules and the new migrants, who have arrived in large numbers since the opening of new routes at Nabire Airport, has deepened.
The few jobs that exist go to better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papuas themselves often lack capital or skills to run competitive business.
"Young people are not interested in staying here because there is neither jobs nor money," says John Gobai, Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Separation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, the foreign media remain subject to severe restrictions.
Towards the beginning of this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were expelled from Papua because "they did not follow the relevant practices', although they had been given a rare film permit.
According to Human Rights Watch, Deputy Head of Department for Asia, Mr Phelim Kine, the election promises made by Mr Jokow have not been implemented to remove the restrictions imposed on reporting to promote transparency and development.
"In Indonesia, journalists trying to make reports from Papua's most peaceful provinces in the east and West Papua are threatened by new threats to visa rejection and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of a caging gaze in the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the near neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific countries, Tonga, Nauru, Belau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "a wide range of crimes' in Papua, including the shooting of Paniai.
These same countries have historically supported the VPL.
Arrmanatha Nasir, a spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dismissed the allegations of the group, saying to journalists in Jakarta: 'Indonesia still has democratic order and freedom of the press, so that it would be difficult to bury the evidence of human rights cases'.
Local people want more foreign governments to pay attention.
When the Dutch official delegation, headed by the National Human Rights Envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people interrupted their silence, according to the source that was present at the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, urging 'we want freedom'.
There will be a new presidential election in Indonesia in 2019, but the baboons do not believe that they will vote for Jokow again.
"Jokowi is a man of good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in Paniai's shooting," says Hobai, Chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokow to understand that, in addition to the fact that Paniai's people are constantly living under the threat of a predatory army, they are suffering from misery because of poor education and health services.
According to Gobai, the people of Paniai, like other baboons, consider the voice they gave Jokow to be the debt he has to pay.
"They don't need money, they want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of Paniai's shootings were able to take on the final symbolic reprisals they buried the body of one of the victims in the land opposite the police station and the military base.
Knowing that justice may never be put on their feet, at least they won't let those responsible forget their crimes.
"One of our family was killed," says Yacobus with his head lowered.
"What else can we do?"
The fire swallowed the Dubai Torch skyscraper for the second time.
The fire went through one of the world's largest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee this 337 metres high and 79-storey building.
This is the second fire that has devastated the high-rise, which happens to be called Torch or Torch Tower, for only two years.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported and no direct causes of fire were reported.
"We slept and woke up on fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor, "said a resident who called himself George.
According to Dubai civil protection officers, firemen erased the flame around 4: 00 in the morning at local time (00.00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said they were working to provide shelter for the victims.
This incident may once again raise questions about the safety of materials used on the external surface of high buildings around the world.
The investigation carried out by the Torch Board following the fire in 2015 found that the façades - decorative panels and insulation of the outer surface - suffered the most damage.
The British police have said that they believe that London's Grenfell Tower isolation and facade panels could have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire in June, where approximately 80 people died.
Look: these phones are probably gonna be sales hits in the fall.
Spring and autumn are a sweet time for technical fans, because then phone manufacturers will publish their new top models.
In spring Samsung Galaxy S8, Huawei P10 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium came to the sale, also in the autumn it is expected to store new hit phones.
According to Tele2 marketing and sales director Kristjan Seema, today's flags are characterised by innovative design, eye iris scanner, a screen with 4K resolution from edge to edge and an ultra fast processor.
Samsung Galaxy S8 was a source of great excitement in the technology world, which has also reached the top of the Estonian smartphone promotion table.
Autumn allows even more fast-charging, a more durable battery, a higher-quality camera and greater water and dust resistance for smart people.
He added that, according to rumours, there are already assumptions to be made and to predict the four top models that are likely to conquer the promotion tables today.
These four top smart phone models will reach the shops in the autumn of this year.
The long-awaited iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus should reach the shops in mid-September.
Rumors of what the new Apple model looks like and what can be done with it are spreading a lot.
While iPhone 7 did not bring significant differences alongside iPhone 6s, Apple's tenth birthday is expected to make a complete distinction between the new model and the previous ones.
Four colours have been mentioned: black, white, pink gold and chromium.
One of the elements of the new design is probably a screen that covers the entire phone panel, a home button has been lost and the fingerprint reader is built inside the screen.
Apple design manager JonyIve demands that the new iPhone model looks like smooth glass.
There has been talk about the ceramic version of iPhone.
In addition to the eye iris scanner, wireless charging and even higher quality camera, you can expect a faster A11 processor.
I'm sure it's one of the most anticipated smartphones in the year.
The pre-order of the brand new Galaxy Note 8 will start on 23 August.
There have been a lot of rumors about what the new Galaxy Note 8 is gonna look like.
It is said that there are even more business users besides and S Pen allows even greater functionality.
The phone should have two cameras, one with a wide angle and the other with a narrower field of vision.
Right now, no one knows what two rear cameras are capable of, but in any case, this is Samsung's first test, which is definitely comparable in quality to iPhone 8.
But we are looking forward to August 23rd.
Although Nokia has sold three smartphones with Nokia 6 this year, there is still a lack of their flagship, Nokia 8, which is already being presented on 16 August.
We expect a screen from Nokia that stretches from 5,3 inch to edge and a super fast Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processors and a more durable battery.
In the case of Nokia, there is also talk about the aluminium housing and a significant degree of water and dust resistance IP68.
Like Samsung, the new model of Nokia has two rear cameras, the optics of which are manufactured by Zeiss.
Once Sony's firm flagship has been in the XZ Premium so far, the manufacturer has confirmed that at least two smartphones will be added in the near future with even more innovative features.
We are waiting for a smartphone that is a little more modest than the XZ Premium, but at least with a good or better camera.
Sony's new model has been speculated that its screen is at least six inches.
What brings reality is that we will soon be able to see, because traditionally, Sony has published its autumn flagship at the International Technology Fair, IFA, which will take place this year from 1 to 6 September.
Trump put pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall, according to the transcripts of telephone calls.
The Washington Post released transcripts of telephone calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the Heads of State of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January Trump made a telephone call to the Mexican President, Enrique Pena Nieto, to end the public announcement that he was not going to pay for the proposed border wall.
The president of the United States cracked the wall with him for public condemnation, saying, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump put his presidential campaign on a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that Mexico would pay for this project.
They also published transcripts of his first speech with the Australian Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, which reveals a intense exchange of views.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the United States of America would take on refugees going to Australia was "ridiculous," "wretched" and "stupid." He claimed that the agreement made during the Obama government would make him look "stupid" because he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees into the United States.
Trump got off the phone telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant speech of the day."
The Supreme Court did not discuss the complaint of OÜ MRP Linna Lines in the case where the City of Tartu rejected their tender for the purchase of bus services from July 2019 to 2029.
This is a letter rejecting the bid from OÜ MRP Linna Lines in Tartu bus procurement, because the offer was not in conformity, explained Anneli Apputin, Head of the Legal Service of the City of Tartu.
This is a public bus service within the city of Tartu for the period 01.07.2019-30.06.2029.
MRP City Lines brought an action before the Supreme Court against the decision of the Tartu District Court.
It was not taken up by the Supreme Court.
Although in social media, many complain that the noise from the Weekend festival is disturbing their sleep and that the whole city is full of drunken partyers, there are also many who do not have any bad words about the festival on the beach.
I'm even positively surprised that the parties at the store were so polite!
I didn't see any hazy or rude.
Even I saw kindness, "said the Persian Wave.
"It is good to come, to be, and to rejoice in Pärnu, which is winter-hibernated," he added joyfully.
There's no interference with the sound of the wave coming from the beach.
When he lived downtown, he used to hear music playing on the beach, and now the music hasn't reached his home.
"But I hope I hear you," he says gladly.
Agnes, who has spoken with the evening light, also says that the festival is rather good for Pärnu - it is a great help for local merchants.
He is also pleased that so many foreigners have come to visit the summer capital.
You don't bother the lady at the party.
Even though I'm not sunbathing on the beach anymore, I'm glad the beach's alive.
And it is good that the people are moving, and it has already been three times, "says the woman.
It must have been a little worse the first time.
"Then perhaps there were complaints," he pondered.
But she says it's common for the summer capital.
"This Weekend is a very good promo for our little town," says Harri, who is nesting in the park.
He hasn't had a pulse in his life, either.
But for what?
We should all stick together.
Think about how better this interethnic communication would be.
A loud music man doesn't get crushed.
It doesn't bother me, even though I live right there.
"Good people can stick together and there's no trouble," he says.
The guests who came to Pärnu, according to him, are polite.
"Of course, they have exaggerated the bottles, but the young are young and the Lord God - let go, but be human and we can do it!" he says.
The people on the beach have travelled somewhere by then, with relatives or acquaintances.
"But in general the festival affects life positively - people like this kind of melu," speaks Tiina, who walked the children in Pärnu.
His family's sleep is not disturbed by the festival music either, even though last year it came further than this year.
Last summer, the stage was the other way round, then we heard more.
We live out of town ourselves, that in fact, there is a good sound coming from far to the Pärnu River, "he says.
Pearson cuts 3,000 more jobs and reduces dividends to revive business.
On Friday, the British education company Pearson said that it would cut 3 000 more jobs and reduce its interim dividends by 72%, thereby launching another restructuring programme to address the threat of business hardship.
According to the CEO, John Fallon, the jobs to be lost, which will most likely be made redundant at the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, will be added to the 4000 posts lost during the previous restructuring.
In May, Pearson announced a plan to cut costs under the third cost reduction programme by an additional GBP 300 million (USD 394 million) to try to revive a business that has been hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company that agreed to sell its shares in Penguin Random House last month to its partner company Bertelsmann said that their expectations regarding the year had not changed since the 1% increase in sales revenue was announced in the first half of the year to GBP 2,05 billion.

Convoy attack in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in a suicide attack
The suicide bomber, according to officials, attacked a military convoy in Kabul, Afghanistan, killing one NATO soldier and hurting several others.
The NATO statement said five soldiers and an interpreter were injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians were also killed in an incident in the town's Qarabagh district.
This bombing is the last of the violence that has struck Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in the Herat mosque attack on Tuesday.
On Monday, two people were killed by a suicide bomber in Kabul near the Iraqi Embassy.
NATO's statement said that Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint patrol with Afghan army was attacked by a "human-carried self-made explosive device."
According to the statement, everyone is in a stable condition and is being treated at a military hospital in the United States at Bagram Airport.
According to the correspondents, the Taliban and a group known as the "Islamic State '(ISIS) are a serious source of concern for the forces in Qarabagh, NATO Bagram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, at least 1662 civilians have died in Afghanistan, of which approximately 20% in the capital.
At the end of July, at least 30 people were killed by a car bomb in Kabul, mostly in the Shiite district.
According to the Taliban, they were behind the attack.
On 31 May, more than 150 people were killed by a major bomb attack in the city centre - the military attack that has led to most deaths in the country since the U. S. led forces forced the Taliban out of power in 2001.
This violence highlights the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States, Donald Trump, is considering whether to increase the number of US troops helping the country's military and police forces.
According to the correspondents, the suicide attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also led to a public crisis of confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, President Ashraf Ghani.
After the actions, the EPA annulled the decision to postpone the order
The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annulled the decision to delay the introduction of the Obama Regulation, which obliges States to limit smoke-causing emissions, one day after 15 states sued the Agency for this move.
EPA announced its decision to continue with "Ozone 2015" procedures late on Wednesday, saying that it demonstrates the Agency's commitment to cooperation with States.
"We believe that we need to engage in dialogue with our state partners and listen to them," said the EPA leader, Scott Pruitt, in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the EPA's intention to postpone the determination of ozone levels in order to measure smoke pollution in various parts of the country in order to determine where its level should be reduced by one year to comply with a stricter air quality standard in October 2018.
The 15 mainly democratic states, together with the Columbia community, brought an action on Tuesday, saying that this decision was illegal.
President Donald Trump's government has tried to withdraw a number of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama, which, according to Trump, is part of a broader growth agenda.
But these efforts have provoked reactions among democracies and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of increased pollutants on human health.
The EPA website states that inhalation of air containing ozone "can reduce lung function and increase the risk of developing respiratory diseases such as asthma.
German pigs can have a party.
German pigs and cattle may have a party because heavy rains threaten the harvest of the second largest wheat producer in the European Union, says Bloomberg.
This year, it may be the case that weeks of sawdust before harvest can mean that only animals can feed the crops intended for the bread industry.
"The quality of wheat is far worse than last year and worse than in 2015," said Agris Raiffeisen's analyst Bernhard Chilla.
This year, up to 40% of German wheat for animal feed, which is double compared to normal, was predicted by Agris.
German farmers, like their European colleagues, have been exposed to all kinds of weather this year.
First of all, winter was too dry.
Then came the cold spring, replaced by a heat wave in June.
In July, Germany was hit by a saw seam, which has continued in August.
Many eyes have been turned to northern Germany, where rain prevents harvesting.
So far, only five percent of wheat has been harvested.
Most of the area hasn't even started harvesting yet, and the local collector of the harvest in Ceravis reported it.
'It's a pretty complicated day, 'said the senior trader in Ceravis, Frank Deckert from Rendsburg.
Consistency in everything or the clever tricks of Finnish interior design
Beautiful nature plays its part in the interior of the fair houses, because through large windows the magnificent views of the banks of Saimaa reach many (life) rooms.
Every step will be marked by the efforts of our northern neighbours to create both hard and perfect (energy-saving) homes.
The skill of Finns in the use of wood as construction and finishing material, in the manufacture of furniture and beauty items is also worthy of admiration and compliance.
Styling techniques and smart solutions can be found in the fair houses by both the builder and the (home) designer.
It is vividly pointed out that black, white and grey shades, if supplemented by shades of wood and house plants, can be very entertaining.
Good ideas can be picked up for another week, because the fair will last until 13 August.
Appliances and herb pots suggest that this kitchen often cooks.
The night against today, the line was drawn down to this year's Weekend Festival Balticu, and Martin Garrix did everything he could to remember as the last performer on the main stage.
The crowd was really turned around during Garrix's performance - the songs, the huilat, the dancing was self-evident.
When Garrix finished, a common mass was scattered from Pärnu beach on the town.
We'll bring you to the gallery with all the pictures our photographer caught on Weekend for three days.
I'm sure you're in one of them too, find yourself!
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible confrontation.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be on a collision course to face the most attractive boxing match in the near future in the weight category of up to 66.7 kg, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in the ESPN office in Los Angeles until Garcia, the invincible World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked across the hall to welcome Lomachenko, World Boxing Organizationist's bloomweight champion.
After the victory over the former four-time world champion Adrien Broner, following the unanimous decision of Garcia, both fighters will be at the top of the weight table on Saturday at Showtime.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
I wish you luck. "
Lomachenko is defending his belt against Miguel Marria on Saturday night at 19: 00 at ESPN.
When a couple posed for photographs, Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas stated that a possible confrontation between fighters would be a "perfect measurement."
"I am former feather weight," recalled Garcia.
"I moved up for Broner [63.5 kg], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 63.5 kilos.
I want to move down to the lightweight.
And he has to move up to the lightweight [61.2 kg] and then we can fight.
That's what fans want.
Then let us offer them this. "
Lomachenko agreed.
"The boxing world needs this fight."
It is part of his strategy to have Lomachenko debut 61.2 kg in class later this year in order to make it possible for a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who will also have an interest in fighting the winner of the Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell match after their lightweight title at the Forum on 23 September.
'Looking at this fight could be paid because the fans have wanted this confrontation, 'said Garcia, later on, saying that she is open to fighting on any channel offering the best financial package.
"We are the main players.
No other name can get that much attention.
Whenever they're ready... "
Garcia said she thought Lomachenko was a "mighty fighter" and could go see his Saturday fight.
Lomachenko, however, was modest in his praise of Garcia, saying that he thought the champion of the three divisions from Riverside looked "very slow; sorry, Mikey... you wanted that knockout."
Garcia said the goal was to show strength and then fight.
Both of them confirmed that they felt the tension growing between them in order to test their strength.
"This is a fight that awaits realization.
No other confrontation will bring so much attention and buzz.
I am more than willing to work for it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've been waiting for the best fighters, and Mikey is just like that.
This will be a good fight. "
Which parts of the world are people moving to Estonia?
Last year, the Police and Border Guard Board (PPA) issued a record number of over 13 000 residence permits for third-country nationals who have mostly travelled to Estonia for work, study or family.
When, for example, it was decided last year to issue a temporary residence permit to 6702 foreigners, this figure was 4928 last year.
The authorities do not know how many immigrants will eventually remain in Estonia, but such an analysis will be carried out in the Ministry of Interior.
While almost 500 Ukrainians moved to Estonia a year ten years ago, in recent years this figure is getting close to 2000.
The number of applicants for residence permits increased exponentially during the crisis in Ukraine - in 2014, 1087 people received a temporary residence permit, a year earlier 675.
According to the Statistical Office, the number of Ukrainian citizens in Estonia grew the most - 850 Ukrainian citizens arrived in Estonia last year more than they left.
"The Ukrainian community has always been large in Estonia and, due to the difficult circumstances in the country, it is natural that work and learning opportunities are sought from a country where the community and many family are already ahead," said Kristin Rammus, spokesman of the Ministry of Interior.
Last year and last year, the number of Ukrainians who had obtained a temporary residence permit was even higher than the number of Russian citizens, even though in ten years the largest number of temporary residence permits were issued to the latter.
If the Ukrainians come here predominantly to work, then Russian citizens for family migration.
"Given the historical Russian community here, they are also more likely to have the most family ties to the people living in Russia," said the Migration Research Fellow of the Academy of Internal Defence, Helina Maasing.
"If you look at where Russian citizens who have received the Estonian residence permit have moved to live, then after Harjumaa there is East Virumaa," he added and pointed out that about 40% of them have married a citizen of the European Union.
Last year, 1696 Russian citizens received a temporary residence permit, which is also a record number.
On the contrary, the number of Russians who wished to extend their residence permit decreased.
"The jump is due to the request for a new residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia instead of the extension of the residence permit," explained Rammus, a spokesman from the Ministry of Interior, who said that the interest of Russian citizens in the Estonian residence permit has remained rather stable for years.
New residence permit for permanent residence in Estonia can be applied for by foreigners who lived here for at least three years last year.
Its aim is to facilitate the stay of people who have adapted.
However, a long-term resident's residence permit requires, for example, five years.
Due to the new residence permit, the extension of the old residence permit appears to have declined.
For example, this kind of residence permit was issued last year to 146 Ukrainians who have worked here for at least three years.
The Ukrainians can now switch jobs and the state of Estonia will no longer follow with its finger whether the wage criterion is met.
This residence permit became popular - applicants last year for holders of grey passports (1029), Russians (487), Indians (54) and Nigerians (36).
A total of 1968 people, including 23 Americans, 12 Egyptians, 18 Georgians and the same number of Chinese, received a residence permit to settle in Estonia.
This year, the total number of such applicants is already 1269.
In 10 years Nigeria has surprisingly become a country whose citizens are among the most active applicants for Estonian residence permits.
When three residence permits were issued to Nigerians in 2007, 200 were issued last year.
They come from Nigeria to study at the universities here.
Estonian higher education institutions are also popular among Georgians, Chinese and Turks, for example.
The number of citizens in India, Bangladesh and Nigeria has risen largely due to the school migration.
They too are subject to the rule that where a community has emerged, others will be more easily there, "Rammus added.
In 10 years, two people have moved to Estonia, for example from North Korea, as much from Laos and Madagascar.
Ten people have come here from Cuba, 231 from South Korea, 40 from Indonesia and four from Uruguay.
If around 6,000 third-country nationals receive a residence permit per year, this is about 0.46% of the total population.
Even if citizens of the European Union were to be included, migration remains at around a percentage point, "said Maasing, in fact, the figures are small.
A total of 14 822 people migrated to Estonia last year, according to the statistics office, and 13 792 people left this country.
This means that immigration exceeded emigration for the second year.
Most of the movers and movers are Estonian citizens, but there are more of them who leave.
As a result, the migration balance of Estonian citizens was negative with 2,000 people last year.
Estonians travel mainly between Finland and Estonia.
Mammu Couture's princess fashion enchantments with sats, embroidery and tulle
The bottomless box of ideas is, however, a history for Maria Tammeoru - old paintings and costumes: "I can dream for hours somewhere in the museum and admire old-fashioned sleeves and collars.
If you do anything with passion, you study and learn more about it every day.
It's the joy of discovery!
Mammu Couture's glamorous world may seem a stranger to some people, but the designer doesn't think so.
You decide how much shine is in your life!
I have a friend who has a whole sauna full of haute couture dresses I created.
Because it's not his fault that he doesn't live in Hollywood and goes to the red carpet every day, he wants to wear those most beautiful dresses, and he does!
You can live your own life special!
The fashion artist does not recognise the gap between bright events and gray everyday.
It was this reasoning that set out the plan to move the high fashion to rural areas in Estonia, between forests and fields, to people who often do not.
Mamma's collection was presented, for example, in Võru, Jõhvi and Pärnu fashion alleys, where 45 models of royal defilet filled the whole street.
In Tallinn, the posture is often taken in, nodded with dignity, but there are more emotions elsewhere - shouting bravo, standing up, wanting to thank you by hand.
A lot of the audience just came to see, but now they're Mammu Couture fans.
If you exceed people's expectations, they'll be thrilled!
And I like the feeling that I'm on a summer tour with my fashion.
In Pärnu, we had a red carpet 50 metres long, full of beautiful dresses all over the street, and it didn't seem like they were going to end!
Maria also does not admit to the fashion that the creation must be presented by a super-slim supermodel; she will gladly bring ordinary women to the stage.
I often invite my own clients to the stage - they have always been happy to come.
It's such a great experience, you can shine on stage in a beautiful dress!
I'm so sorry that I've never seen my own show, and I'm always backstage to give you the final touch as a hopeless perfectionist.
My nerve wouldn't allow you to sit back and watch the floor.
Maria is the kind of fashion maker who wants not only to play the role of representation, but to be in everything by hand.
I have my own sewing machine in the studio, most of the collection I'm doing myself.
I like the whole process where you play with the details, you discover.
I'm never far from my creation, and I'm not afraid of work.
The design is not limited, including stylistics, logistics, organisation, organisation - everything has to fit in one temperamental woman's day.
I guess the fanatics have a lot of work to do.
I can't tell you when my working day ends, for me it's just a day full of joy!
I'm really lucky - it's like a relentless chain of happiness: I do something beautiful, a person gets something beautiful and a compliment.
How many times has it been said that my dresses have magic - they make you feel like a princess.
The plentiful gruesome satchels that made Maria's talent famous overnight have remained Mammu Couture's signature to this day.
Martin Müürsepp of the U18 boys: The gun of the Estonian sub-group tournament was now turned against us
Sorry, I'm out of fairy tales.
The first thing I saw was that we couldn't get our desk.
And when there is such a big difference at the table, there is nothing to do about it, "Estonian U18 basketball boys 61: 75 commented our only basketball player who played in the NBA, BC Kalev / Cramo assistant coach Martin Müürsepp.
The opponents took 28 balls from the assault table, and that's why they got so many more attacks.
We weren't ready for their aggressive defense or attack, either. It created.
Many of the British attacks ended in three to five seconds, we couldn't build a defense.
But in defense, they were able to hold hands everywhere, so we couldn't combine.
It knocked the team's legs out.
The team's homework was better done.
According to the masonry, Estonia should have made more tactical mistakes in order to take down the enemy's momentum.
In the last quarter, we had zero mistakes, but the opponents have already received several quick baskets.
Attendance and intense insistence, which was our weapon in the sub-group tournament, has now turned against us all.
Today we had no strength against their aggression.
The masonry was satisfied with his ward in Kalev, Matthias Tassi.
On the tournament in general, you can say good words about the whole team, so far there was a single punch fist.
It's a pity you never met such an aggressive opponent before.
The cup has always been self-confident and played its way out today, but it seemed that he was weary - he suffered quite a burden.
But he made some pretty nice moves I've seen in practice before, "added the tutor.
Horrible numbers: in the ladies' basketball team, the EM tournament threw less than 10 points in three quarters...
In the U18 age class, it is not just the young men's EM B-division basketball tournament in Tallinn, the girls started in Dublin the day before yesterday.
And the Estonian game with Poland did, unfortunately, fall into the field of anti-record.
Estonia lost 25: 65, but after the third quarter it was 9: 49, or only in the last 10 minutes did the opponents take foot on the gas pedal, and that period was tied to 16: 16.
In both the first and the second quarters Estonia scored 4 points, in the third one...
In doing so, the Estonians first hit two out of the first four shots in two minutes, then 25 past the game, then one in three and then 21 more shots...
Maybe in almost half an hour one of 47 shots was caught.
Plus, two points out of four free throws came in.
The ball losses were a reasonable number of times, 12.
By the end of the game, Poland had a shot rate of 33% and Estonia had 13 percent (68 / 9).
Estonia has started with two losses; on the opening day, Portugal's 83: 56 superiority had to be recognised.
NATO ships came to Tallinn to replenish supplies
Today, NATO's 1st permanent mine-fighting group arrived in Tallinn for the weekend on a planned port visit to complement ship supplies and prepare for the upcoming exercises.
During the visit, the ships prepare for their return to the sea and, in so doing, give crew members the opportunity to take a few days' leave.
After the visit, NATO ships will remain in Estonian waters to carry out several exercises and be prepared for future operations in search of historic explosives.
"The participation of Estonians in the NATO unit and the co-operation training they undertake in local waters is a good indication of our integration with the Allied forces," said Major Arto Reinmaa, Commander of the Operations and Planning Department in charge of the Navy fleet commander.
From 29 June, NATO is leading the 1st permanent mine control group of Latvian Marine Commander Gvido Laudups, who took over the role of group commander from Estonian naval officer Johan-Elias Seljamaa at the ceremony in Riga.
The flag vessel of the group is designated as the Latvian naval support ship in LVNS Virsait, which is also operated by the group's command headquarters.
During this six-month year, Sakala, a minehunter from the Estonian Navy, is also a member of the international unit.
As one of the four groups of ships under the NATO Maritime Command, NATO's permanent mine control group 1 is a ready-to-reach unit belonging to the first high-speed response group, which can be sent to different parts of the world within five days by an alliance.
From 4 to 13 August, the ancient ruins of the Pirita monastery will once again become a place where the Birgitta Festival, which was brought to life 13 years ago by Maestro Special Klas, will be held down.
According to this year's Birgitta Festival, the artistic leader of Tallinn Philharmonic, Risto Joost (36), will be beautiful, powerful and unprecedented.
Risto Joost: The celebrities of the opera world are reached by "Traviata" and "Tosca," ballet productions from the fascinating "Bolero" to the fun "Karlsson" and neither is there a plan for self-production, which is this time the production of Joseph Haydn's wonderful organ "Seasons" by the same international creative team who brought the other Hayden masterpiece "Creation" to the stage in 2015.
Birgitta Festival is much more than just concerts and theatrical performances.
It's bigger than any music theater in its usual form.
It's a festival whose fascination takes over and never lets go.
Because the experience that a listener receives in this sublime and mysterious environment makes the human souls ring and touches the human senses in a way that cannot be described.
Risto, you're the artistic head of the Birgitta Festival for the first year.
Didn't the Maestro Special Klass shoes look a little big?
Of course, but since I had a very personal relationship with Special Kles, it's been very helpful.
He directed me through my entire student career and also supported me at the beginning of the career of conducting.
Maybe that's why it makes it easier for me to continue his work.
The different Klas have injected so much goodness into the Birgitta Festival team and, of course, all this will be transferred to me.
It was great to join a team who knows exactly how things work.
It was the great heart of the Special Klass that also gave me the strength to move forward with the Birgitta Festival in Tallinn Philharmonic.
And here I am, and I can do it!
What could turn the audience on at the festival this year that you are offering?
We have an artist from England, Latvia, Lithuania and, as a surprise, the first ballet written on the story of Astrid Lindgren comes to the presentation.
It's Karlsson flying.
And a curious nuance about it is that the author of this ballet is the Latvian composer, Juris Karlsons, who himself expressed his wish to write this work.
Apparently, he's had a Karlsson character living in his soul since he was a kid.
Risto, how can you do all this?
Thanks to my partner in support, I'm sure.
This kind of work needs a support system and a lot of love, and I'm lucky to have a lot of it.
And I've noticed that my personal emotions don't depend as much on other people as I do on myself, or how I'm going to meet every new day.
And keeping such a conscious tone, keeping positive, and actually smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, greatly increased my percentage of happiness.
Especially this week, when there are the most important samples, I have practiced it especially hard and it works.
Smiling at yourself activates the brain and raises the tone.
It's not just a word.
I don't think people know half the things about their bodies that the universe offers them, but it's just that it's slowly discovered by everyone.
Now, this is a big moment.
Do you have any ritual before you step into the conductor's remote?
Yes, it is. You have to change for more comfortable clothes.
This is the little moment for yourself.
But in general, yes, I don't have a chance to rest or take a nap before the big show.
In fact, I actually like to actively communicate with people, even before stepping into the conductor's remote.
But everyone come to Birgitta Festival, there's something to discover for a friend of the not-so-great opera and ballet!
Look at the mood video with Risto Joost!
New results of age assessment tests for asylum applicants in Sweden were published
In Sweden, a test was carried out among asylum applicants, in which their age was assessed medically with a novel approach. The latest results of the test show that more than 80% of the testes were judged older than 18, but not all believe in the accuracy of the results.
The Swedish National Judicial Institute (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing towards the beginning of this year.
The tests were set up in the context of the application for asylum for a more accurate assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly determine the age of several alleged minors' refugees.
Migraationsverket has now sent 6880 cases to the test and the Institute of Forensic Medicine has issued a total of 2481 tests between mid-March 2017 and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 years of age or older and, in 25 further cases, the Institute of Forensic Medicine assessed that the test subject "could be 18 years of age or older '.
In 432 cases, it was concluded that the person is "probably younger than 18 '.
The test is only used if the age of the person is in question.
According to Johan Göransson, working at the Institute of Forensic Medicine, the results are consistent with those of the previous months.
"We do not see a large difference in the statistics of previous months, the numbers are quite consistent," he said to The Local.
The fact that a large number of cases were estimated to be older than 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum applicants have lied about their age.
The Institute issued 581 test results in May and said that 442 cases "there are indications that the subject is 18 years of age or older."
But when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the results of these 581 tests, it turned out that in 243 cases the person had directly claimed to be 18 this year.
This medical age assessment method, which involves taking X-rays from the teeth of wisdom and MRI from the knee joints, which is then allowed to be analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has been criticised in some circles.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute, whose duties include assessing people's biological maturity in order to determine whether they passed puberty sooner or later.
"I have had reason to think about it, and I do not think that the measurement method currently used should be used.
Determination of biological age in this way is highly uncertain.
If we cannot say for sure, then we should not pretend that we can, "he said to Metro.
But Johan Göranson from the Institute of Forensic Medicine defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, it can be said that the risk of dissecting a child inaccurately to adulthood is low.
The highest, or about 10%, risk is when a person is just under 18. "

The 20-year-old hammer launcher Anna Maria Orel made a beautiful debut on the London MMs, getting a good 18 with 67.37.
The organ was the youngest female hammer thrower in the MM, and the cheerful woman confirmed that she hopes to fight for medals in the future.
The competition went well, and I got a good experience.
In the first attempt (64.80) I immediately passed my average result, in the second (62.80) I risked too much, and in the third (67.37) I was able to keep my head clear, "says Orel after the race.
I was looking for my emissions, and I'm really glad I found it.
Anna Maria Orel's MM debut ended up with a good 18.
The rainfall didn't bother Orel because he's training through the winter at the TUT stadium.
"I'm tempered," he said with a little smile.
At the London Olympiad, there was almost a full house of people, or was Orel able to detect people around him, or was he able to turn himself off?
I did, but in a positive way.
Everyone says it's more, that's it!
If you compete, you can experience it.
Orel confirmed that he will be satisfied with the MM debut and that there are many more good competitions to be held: "I came here this year with the 32nd or final result of the season, I ended up in 18th place.
That's a very decent result.
I'm 20 years old and MM-- that's all that matters.
I take a good experience with me, and some days I want to race for medals.
The Governor of West Virginia has announced a party change.
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced on Thursday night at a meeting with President Trump that he would switch parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats walked away from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I tell you, having prayed and thought hard... today I tell you, Western Virginia, that I can no longer help you as a democratic governor."
The gatherings triggered the joyous joys.
"So I'll be a Republican tomorrow," added Justice.
"As a coach, I'd tell you it's time to play another game."
Trump had promised a great announcement earlier at the Western Virginia gathering.
Trump won in West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice didn't support the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the state, according to Forbes, was elected in 2016.
Forbes points out that he owns coal mines in five states and that he inherited the coal business from his father.
Its value is about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee (RNC) announced on Thursday evening that "Governor Justice's party exchange is another blow to the democratic party, which would prevent the country from being improved again rather than working towards it."
"Only 15 governors and control over the lowest number of states in history - Governor Justice's announcement is simply the most recent rejection of a party that is completely out of control and cannot find a positive and unifying message," said RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel in his statement to CBS News.
It's no surprise that where there are many people, there are also many injured.
Urmet in the medical tent on Weekend told Evening yesterday that they had to distribute a lot of patches.
The blisters and abrasions are basic, wrinkles and slight falls.
And, of course, headaches, back pains and leg pains.
According to Urmet, visitors come to the festival with the wrong shoes, and that's how the problems come.
The medics have also had to assist visitors with a couple of major injuries - there have been some panic attacks and also one fracture of the leg.
We have also made stitches when a person has broken a hand or finger.
We'll do the smaller stitches here, we'll send the bigger ones to the hospital.
Check the video to see if the festive medics are asking for a painkiller to treat a hangover.
Coe praised the Russians' honest apology for the doping scandal.
According to Sebastian Coe, the international leader of the athletics community, he said, "Russia's Thursday's honest apology," because of the doping scandal, but repeated that this is not the time to allow the country back to sport.
Dmitry Shylahtin, the leading Russian athletics leader, said at the IAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championship that the ban on competition imposed on his country was correct and had a firm aim to combat doping.
He said he was sorry about "all the track classes that got gold and silver medals nailed out of the competition."
Despite his comments, the IAEA Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban on competition introduced in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-supported doping in Russia.
"I think it was a very honest answer today, a very honest presentation," said President Coe of the IAF to the journalists.
"The whole Council and the whole Congress were pleased that the Russian subunion itself acknowledged that they had been going through quite difficult times and that they were doing everything possible to restructure the subunion."
According to Coe, he was also pleased that Russia accepted the criteria for its reinstatement.
"I believe that today was a very constructive day and progress is taking place, but Congress supports the group's proposal that this is not the time to take Russia back," said Coe.
"We must do everything we can to normalise the situation in the next few months.
We have always been guided by the principle that we want to separate pure athletes from the corrupt system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian Athletics, who meet the strict criteria of the IAF, compete as neutral athletes in the World Athletics Championships starting in London on Friday.
Rune Andersen, Head of the IAF Group, said on Monday that Russia did not yet meet a number of restoration criteria.
Following a presentation to the IAF Council, he told journalists in London that doping checks were still inadequate and that the banned trainers were still operating freely.
The revolution in electric cars will significantly change the demand for metals.
Who are the winners and the losers?
Not only does the electric car revolution significantly change everything from the fuel market to the infrastructure, it also creates new winners and losers in the metal market.
Although mining giants like Glencore can say that they win and lose from one place, smaller mining companies will not benefit.
At present Glencore serves coal and oil, but in the future, demand for cobalt, lithium, copper, aluminium and nickel will grow in the era of electric cars.
This year, the UK, French and Norwegian governments have increased their contribution to the expansion of electric cars by allowing the sale of new cars using fossil fuels to be banned in the coming decades.
Therefore, Volvo has already announced that they are planning to abandon the internal combustion engine and Tesla will bring a cheaper model 3 electric car to the market.
Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates that more electric cars than those using oil-based fuels will be sold in two decades.
"For some metals this changes everything," said Capital Economists raw material analyst Simona Gambrani Bloomberg.
We have already seen a major impact on metals such as cobalt and lithium, which have been growing in demand for years.
There's about three times more copper in electric cars than in conventional cars. Glencore reported it.
More copper is needed at the loading stations, which is why Exane BNP Paribas estimates that it will increase copper demand by about five per cent by 2025.
The increase in demand for electric car batteries means additional demand for lithium, cobalt, graphite and manganese.
Glencore will benefit from the growing trend of electric cars from the rise in copper prices and from being the world's largest cobalt producer, forecast by the Jefferies Group.
According to this brokerage company, the other winners of the electric car race are Freeport-McMoran and First Quantum Minerals.
The market is already responding to a changing trend.
This year, 70 per cent of the cave has been expensive on the London Metal Exchange.
Last year's price increase was 37 percent.
Copper has also increased by 14% this year, mainly due to economic growth.
The Glencore stock rose 20 percent in London, having exceeded the rivals of the Rio Tinto Group, BHP Billiton and Anglo Americas from the price increase.
On the losing side are lead companies such as Recyclex and Campine, which have to adapt to the new era.
The main end-use of lead is electric batteries for starting cars with petrol and diesel engines.
Electric cars use lithium ion batteries.
"This is a serious risk to the demand for lead, unless it is found for another purpose capable of overcoming the fall in demand," said Michael Widmer, Head of Analysis of the Metal Market of the Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The effect of the unrolling trend is not yet noticeable in the form of the lead price movement.
Lead has cost 17 per cent this year, which is the best metal in London from the price increase among the main industrial metals.
Investors will only see problems for metals in the long future.
"I am not sure that lead is so bad because cheap oil keeps conventional cars competitive," said the metal brokerage company Triland Metals sales manager Herwig Schmidt.
When the demand for lead falls, it happens slowly.
Maybe this will happen in about ten years.
In the meantime, stricter emission standards mean that the demand for hybrid cars, which depend on advanced lead-based batteries when frequent engines are started, will be assessed by an international lead and zinc research organisation.
Light metals such as aluminium replace steel because a lighter car can travel further with less electricity.
This explains the additional demand of 1,6 million tonnes of aluminium from 2013 to 2016.
This represents 2.7 per cent of the total world production of aluminium.
Probably this trend gets worse, said Widmer.
Aluminium has increased by 13 per cent this year, as the growing demand from car manufacturers has led to market shortages.
Steel producers don't sleep.
AK Steel Holding is working with General Motors to use nanotechnology for the production of super light car hulls.
ArcelorMittal and Tata Steel Europe are also trying to develop lighter alloy steel to resist aluminium.
"Superstrong steel should be the answer to this development," said Exane BNP Paribas analyst Sylvain Brunet.
Some progress can be seen in Europe.
The end of the oil age can also bring suffering to platinum.
Last year, about half of this metal was used as catalysts for diesel-powered cars, reported by the metal refiner Johnson Matthey.
"Many of the currently high demand raw materials such as oil and platinum may not have much demand in the future," said Bernard Dahdah, Natixis raw material analyst.
This does not mean that raw materials as a whole will become less important, but their importance will change over 15 years.
Platinum manufacturers believe in the continued demand for hybrid diesel vehicles.
Uncore leader Marc Grynberg said that in 2025, more hybrid cars will continue to be sold from full electric cars.
The great hope of platinum manufacturers in the 10-year term is that of the hydrogen element-based cars developed by Toyota Motor and Hyundai Motos, which depend on platinum to produce hydrogen electricity.
However, until now, this technology has not yet proved commercially valid.
"Diesel seems to be a clear loser on the way to electric cars," said Exane BNP from Paribas, Brunet.
German car manufacturers suffered a major setback in July, as the Stuttgart Court prohibited the use of diesel in the home town of Mercedes-Benz and Porsche.
How the monetary rules of football influence the transition of Neymar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unbridled spending of European football clubs do not prevent the world record transition of Neymar from the Spanish football club to the Barcelona French club Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences from UEFA, the governing body that rules the European game and which has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Championship League tournament, are still waiting for Paris Saint-Germain.
The financial rules on fair play (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the Neymar transfer was financed without huge losses.
Barcelona was paid EUR 222 million (USD 262 million) just to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar's salary starts to reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar's trip to the French club.
PSG will undoubtedly be able to raise this kind of money to recruit Neymar and add it to its star-rich lineup, given that the team is financed by a family that is ruling on the energy bracket of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to recruit players, but they have to balance it with legal sources of income that allow them to get out of the football business.
FFP was founded by Michel Platini after being elected President of UEFA in 2007.
This former French player believed that clubs that fell into big debts in search of success actually engage in fraud and risk corruption if banks or owners were to give up support.
As of 2011, FFP will focus on monitoring losses rather than debts of the clubs.
This change means that the business model that Roman Abramovich first used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then making a huge cost to improve the team and create a global brand - is more difficult to implement.
According to the information provided by the French authorities, the Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market within the meaning of Article 107 (3) (c) of the Treaty.
And even though Platini was disgraced by the presidential office in 2015, his successor to UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still committed to preventing excessive spending.
"The FFP is certainly not dead and we will undoubtedly continue to strengthen these rules in the future," said The Associated Press Andrea Traverso last week, who is the supervisor of the FFP at UEFA.
Although PSG paid for the purchase clause of Neymar as a single full payout, it is possible for them to split this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, which makes it possible to show the transitional fee for the next five years, on an annual basis, as an amount of EUR 44,4 million.
As regards the first wave of TFP sanctions in 2014, PSG, together with Manchester City, owned by Abu Dhabi, received the most severe sanctions.
PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million (USD 82 million at the time), which was later reduced to EUR 20 million, and the club was required to limit the team of the Champions League to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is looking for clubs that can try to outsmart regulatory financial institutions by blowing up their income through companies associated with club owners.
The Qatar company may sponsor PSG, but if the value of the sponsorship is considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as a formal income.
This was the case in 2014, when UEFA decided that Qatar Tourism Authority PSG support was inflated.
It has been said that a certain part of the service of Neymar PSG may come from Katar through payments made by the World Championship Management Committee in 2022.
However, PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar could become an ambassador to the World Championship and claim that the UEFA regulators could easily reveal such a manoeuvre.
The sanctions previously imposed on PSG mean that UEFA is even more vigilant in relation to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
People who were familiar with the situation said on Thursday that UEFA had not discussed the transition with PSG in advance.
They spoke with The Associated Press on the condition that their anonymity is guaranteed, as they are not allowed to discuss the situation of the PSG.
The latest published reports show that PSG made a profit of more than EUR 10 million during the 2015-2016 season at a turnover of approximately EUR 542,4 million.
Data for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG hopes that the arrival of Neymar will be good for sponsorship, shopping and shirt sales.
The club expects an increase of at least 30% in turnover due to the conclusion of the contract.
The Spanish league, clearly upset by the departure of one of the largest football stars, tried to stop Neymar from moving, claiming that PSG was violating FFP.
"This is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said La Liga President Javier Tebas to the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that PSG belongs mainly to Qatar.
Arsenal's manager Arsene Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnate, shares with La Liga the view that the State finances the club.
"This is the result of property rights and has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"If the club belongs to the state, anything is possible.
It is very difficult to respect the financial rules of fair play, as the state may have other ways or other interests in order for such a large player to represent the country. "
Norwegian, Norwegian low-cost airline, has a nice tradition of putting pictures of those who have shifted borders in their own field and have been an inspiration to others, and writes:
With the expansion of Norwegian's geography of operations, the circle of people who have earned a place on the plane's keel has also expanded.
Among the selected personalities are Benjamin Franklin, Greta Garbo (picture) and Miguel de Cervantes.
But in the near future, a plane will be decorated by the portrait of Queen's legendary singer Freddie Mercury.
50 years ago today: hurricane-sized storm in Estonia, which tore roofs and windows from houses.
A hurricane called the storm of the century, which on 6 and 7 August caused major damage, especially to Läänemaa, Harjumaa and Raplamaa.
In north-west Estonia, the wind speed was over 30 m / s during these days.
My old man ran from one bend tree in the garden to another and touched his hands to support them.
It was all dark and rough, like the end of the world.
In 2002, old lady Linda Kurova recalled Haapsalu's magazine in the interview given by Estonian Nature.
Linda's husband saw her garden collapse.
But what are you gonna do with a tree with your hands where you're gonna get a storm like this?
The sea came under the window, the water splashed in the windows, "said Mrs Linda, who lived on Kalda Street in Haapsalu.
The fact that the roads were full of trees and that the train station's apron roof had flown 20 to 30 metres away, Linda saw most of the Haapsalu just like it did the next morning.
According to the locals, behind Paralepa there were trees in the woods, some completely down, some in half.
Everything looked very depressing, the storm went through beautiful old trees with a rag and a crack like a war.
Lääne-Virumaa was not particularly badly affected by the storm in August 1967 compared with western Estonia, but the damage was also great, and the Journal of Virumaa wrote in 2007.
Haapsalu Castle Park and Padis Park were wiped off the face of the earth, but our neighborhood parks were badly damaged.
In Tallinn, wind speed was measured up to 35 meters per second, or about 130 kilometers per hour.
On the evening of August 6, at Merivälja in Tallinn, a little girl had said: "Mother, mother!
The chickens are in the air and can't get down!, "wrote the Virumaa Journal.
The Põlli Manor building in Viljandi County was destroyed during the storm in such a way that it was later decided to demolish it.
The structures of the Türi ski jump mountain, which were not restored later, did not survive the August storm.
The Red Star newspaper wrote on 12 August 1967 that the cleaning of cities and settlements from the fallen trees and their branches is slowly progressing, and the inhabitants could be involved in the cleaning work.
In the storm, the fields of fruit were also badly affected, and the newspaper stated that "basic party organisations must be inspiring and guiding both during the upkeep and in the harvest."
You can talk about hurricanes if the average wind speed exceeds 32.7 m / s.
The wind record in Estonia stands from 2 November 1969, when Ruhnul measured wind speed at 48 m / s.
A measuring instrument broke down on the island of Vaindloo, so the speed of the strong wind measured there could not be accurately recorded.
The secret of clean bathing areas: night cleaning and poor beach weather
The colder summer weather also means less cleaning work in Tallinn's bathing areas.
"If it's weather, people are on the beach, and if it's not, there's no people," says the beach janitor.
There are gulls screaming on the beach of the North-Tallinn Stroom.
For them, the melody competition is offered by a tractor that burns down at low turns, plowing stripes on the plaza.
In fact, the last one sieves through seven centimetres of sand, picking up marine debris and the waste left behind by humans: bottle stoppers, cigarette cans and so on.
People still come to the beach, whether the water's warm or not.
If it is beautiful weather, people are on the beach, and if it is not, there are no people, "says Alexander Usov, director of the cleaning-up work of the Haabersti Management.
It's 6: 30, and there's a bitter cleaning up on the beach, because at 8: 00, the court has to be fine for people.
Usov's already on duty at 4: 00.
After Stroomi, he keeps an eye on Pirita, Lake Harku, Kakumäe and Paljasaar Pikikari Beach.
Landfill has decreased.
Years ago, it was much more.
People can now appreciate what is being done for them, "says Usov, who has been cleaning the beaches for 15 years.
Before, when something new got set up, it was broken the next day.
Now they're holding what's on the beach.
Price of clean beach
One of the biggest works on Estonian beaches is cleaning up sea litter or plow washed ashore.
For example, on Pirita beach, it has to be transported to 400 000 tons of beach season.
"This is an incredible amount," Usov notes.
Another big category is municipal garbage, that is, everything people leave behind.
The two-and-a-half-mile shoreline of the Stroomi has eight large dumpsters that need to be emptied three times a week.
There's so much garbage.
However, colder summer weather has meant that the garbage is one fifth less than otherwise.
The third species is abandoned.
Most of the time, it's a children's show.
As a result of this harvest, Usov has shoveled a dozen model cars out of the sand.
They'll be waiting for the owners on the wooden road to the beach.
"They usually come out more, but it's a normal catch." Usov already knows that soon he will find them in the sand again.
Kids come to the beach and take toys to drown them in the sand again.
The trash is being torn apart.
Erika Scholler, a representative of Haabert's administrative services, acknowledges that the screening work of the tractor disrupts the local authorities.
The noise that lasts from hours of night to morning is interfering with the sleep of people living in the neighbourhood.
But this job is impossible during the day.
In one month, the beach has to be screened twice.
"If we don't, the district will fine us," Scholler says.
But the goal is to get the Stroomi beach under the international blue flag, like Pirita, Pikikari and Pärnu.
"There is much more work in Estonia than in Europe to maintain beaches," Scholler says.
We have more ploughs and stones and harder to sift the sand.
But there is less garbage on our beaches than there is in other parts of Europe.
Listening to the debris on the beach, Martin, who lives near the beach of Stroomi, will unreservedly enter the conversation circle between the journalist and the cleaning staff, highlighting the current bottlenecks on the beach.
In the morning, there's a nasty picture everywhere.
The problem is with birds and bottle collectors who have pulled the garbage bags inside out, "says Martin.
Although it is difficult to assume that people can change their behaviour, Martin hopes that the city administration will do something about garbage cans and put covers on them, for example, to prevent at least the birds from going out there.
In general, however, Martin is satisfied with the development of the Stroomi beach.
You can see the city's taking care of it.
With children's courts, enlightened and freshly asphalted roads, it has become more pleasant.
It was once that the roller skates could only ride on one road, "Martin points out.
Contestant findings in Stroomi: coins, coins only
A 40-year-old Dimitri has come to take advantage of the tide of the morning, combing the beach with a metal detector as a treasure hunter.
He doesn't think he's gonna find anything precious today or in the future.
The gods of the sea are not generous enough.
"I've been doing this for a year, and I've found nothing of value so far," says Dmitri.
As a hobby hunter, Dmitri has some euro coins, bottle stoppers and also dangerous nails in the treasure home, which will later be thrown into the trash.
It's usually coins.
"There is no gold, no rings, no such thing," said the treasure hunter.
Bank of England keeps interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, as weak growth and inflation easing have softened speculation as a result of rising inflation.
The Bank of England has warned that growth will remain sluggish, as household tight incomes have put interest rates on hold.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6: 2 in favour of keeping the rates at 0.25% and fewer members are calling for an increase this month, as slow economic growth has weakened support for the rise.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank slashed its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, and warned that the pressure on household incomes would persist as inflation is still expected to rise to 3% in the autumn.
However, the bank also signalled that an increase in rates over the next few years would be necessary to contain Brexit inflation and that a higher than expected increase in credit costs might be necessary in the financial markets.
Members also voted in favour of the partial withdrawal of the mammoth package, which was launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
In February, the Bank will complete a fixed-term financing scheme which will provide banks with cheap funding, although it said that it is now expected to offer GBP 15 billion more, which is GBP 115 billion.
In the minutes of the decision on the issue, the Bank says: "In the MPC central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) will remain weak in the near future, as the difficult situation of households' real income will continue to have an impact on consumption."
As regards the rates, it was reiterated that, in order to alleviate inflation, "some tightening of monetary policy" is needed, to the extent that "somewhat higher" is expected on the markets.
The stock exchange currently predicts a first increase in the third quarter of next year and a second increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any kind of jump would be gradual and limited.
The Bank's reduced growth forecasts for this year and the following year are comparable to those for May of 1.9% and 1.7%.
The forecast growth of 1.8% in 2018 was maintained.
After that news, the pound fell in exchange for the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to make any changes is due to recent disappointing growth figures, which have dampened rising expectations of GDP rising in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3% in the second quarter.
The bank says that growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is beginning to gain some momentum at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to cheer up households suffering from rising inflation and miserable wage increases, saying that the situation is going to get a little worse before recovery.
It was added that monetary policy could not prevent income-bearing shocks in the next few years, but a significant wage recovery is expected towards the end of the three-year forecast.
Due to the weak pound, the economy is also stimulated by the growing demand for British production, which partially compensates for lower consumer costs.
The decision comes a year after the rates were moved to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU referendum, which caused the pound to be suddenly weakened.
According to the bank, it is likely to take four years to completely breathe life into prices and the economy.
Before the Bank's last decision, there was a growing demand for an increase in the rate, as inflation had increased the pressure on vulnerable households; in July, three policy makers demanded an increase to 0.5%.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month, compared to 2.9% in June, although, according to the bank, it was expected to do so and a rise is due again in the coming months.
The bank said that excessive growth compared to the 2% target was due to a completely weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, head of Coreco mortgage brokers, said: "In view of the recent fall in exchange rates, the mortgage market seems to be becoming increasingly competitive as lenders crave work and hope to complete the year positively.
The stock exchange seems particularly favourable to those whose current transactions are about to be completed, as refinancing, often free of fees and at low rates, has become increasingly popular. "
NHS is about to prescribe an HIV drug to 10,000 people that caused an inconsistency.
Since September, patients have had access to "transformative" HIV prevention after a battle in the Supreme Court on whether NHS should finance the medicine.
NHS England reported that public health is now estimated to make 10 000 pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) tablets available to humans during the initial three-year clinical trial, which have shown a reduction in the risk of infection of approximately 86% in high-risk individuals.
NHS agreed to finance a clinical trial after the Court of Appeal supported the Supreme Court's ruling last year that NHS would be able to pay for PrEP, despite the Authority's own claims that the medicine should be financed by local authorities.
Mr Simon Stevens, CEO of NHS England, welcomed this public visit on Thursday as a "new large-scale intervention," whereas the National Fund for AIDS (NAT) described it as a "momentary moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield are among the first to register people. In October, more clinics will be added before the programme is implemented anywhere in England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a course of HIV medicines that are taken before intercourse to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Clinical trial results indicate that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV to people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body to prevent HIV infection.
These medicines may be taken every day or at the latest two hours before intercourse.
Appropriate candidates for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are infected with HIV and are not treated.
Clinicians shall identify suitable individuals who are willing to participate in a clinical trial, including men, women, transgender individuals and those who do not receive antiretroviral therapy from a partner with HIV.
People who live in England and have chosen a family doctor there will also be able to register their wish to participate in the local sexual health clinic participating in the programme.
The programme costs GBP 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to get the medicines this week after international procurement.
The purpose of the clinical trial is to assess the actual potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence of who the medicinal product is intended for, and how it is consumed and applied in a large picture.
Stevens said: "This new widespread intervention should complement and amplify the comprehensive and increasingly successful fight against the spread of HIV.
It is yet another milestone in the struggle for more than three decades to address one of humanity's greatest health problems. "
Deborah Gold, Managing Director of NAT, said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is properly targeted at those who need it and are at risk, offers an opportunity to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Since September, people at high risk of HIV in England, through this clinical trial funded by NHS, have access to a powerful new tool that is individually managed and independent of negotiations with a partner, thereby improving many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement. "
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "It is now essential to ensure that the clinical trial is rapidly launched across the country and that none of the members of the HIV risk group is excluded.
Now that the PrEP clinical trial drug has been obtained, we are on our way to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of getting HIV.
Public Health Shadow Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP clinical trial is very welcome and very late after months of delay and dragging government feet.
Evidence shows how much this medicine can bring to an end in HIV prevention and the spread of this life-changing infection.
This clinical trial will take us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the clinical trial be introduced across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society. "
Electricity prices in Estonia increased by 12%, while Latvia and Lithuania fell.
In July, the difference in electricity exchange prices between Estonian and Latvian and Lithuanian price areas decreased to EUR 1.94, compared to EUR 7.71 this June, Elering announced.
The main reason for the price difference is the malfunctioning of the Lithuanian-Swedish Community.
In Estonia, the average price of electricity on the exchange was 34.33 euros per megawatt-hour last month, and the price rose by 12 per cent compared to June.
In Latvia and Lithuania, the price fell by five per cent to EUR 36.27 per megawatt-hour.
In Finland, the price was EUR 34,17 and the system price of Nord Pool was EUR 26,37 per megawatt-hour.
Prices increased by 12 and 7% respectively.
Between Estonia and Finland, electricity moved 75% of last month's hours towards Estonia and 16% of the hours from Estonia to Finland.
The remaining nine percent of the hours between the two countries did not have the next day's transactions.
Between Estonia and Latvia, electricity moved 99% of the time from Estonia to Latvia and 73% of the hours had total transmission capacity.
According to the transactions on the Nasdaq OMX market on the last trading day of July, the electricity exchange price could be around 34 euros in August and 37 euros per megawatt-hour in September.
The price of carbon dioxide affecting the price of electricity production rose last month and transactions took place between EUR 5.04 and EUR 5.47 per tonne.
The House of Excellence - the half-floor and the smart design cues have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home.
Joanne Leigh, a former banker, who is a passionate real estate innovator, traded his big Knightsbridge home in 2014 for an apartment at Earls Court.
It's on the first floor of Queen Anne Terrace, and the fact that Joanne hasn't packed her bags and resold her apartment is a tribute to the new design.
"Before that, I lived with a former partner in Knightsbridge on a much larger ground," said Joanne.
"I was looking for something that would be equivalent to the price I'm offering.
They showed me this apartment at Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with it and made an offer the same day. "
Since the first visit, this 93-square-metre apartment has undergone a complete renewal.
At first, it was an apartment with one bedroom and a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen. Joanne wanted to add a storage room and a half-floor to take advantage of the high ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
These were my demands, "he said.
He hired Erfan Azadi from an architectural and design studio in Notting Hill, Duck & Shed, to take advantage of the 3,8 m high ceilings and create a home that would not just be a development object, but a place where Joanne could live.
The ceiling was not high enough to add two rooms to each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a half-floor where you could stand up.
Erfan was supposed to be creative.
"Metal construction is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to rearrange the rooms so that they would be on top of each other without having to bend over.
It was not just the construction of the platform, but we used the steel structure to make both the upper and the lower room the right height. "
This arrangement allowed Erfan to create two rooms with lots of dramatic elements on top of each other in the room.
From the half-floor there is a view of the glamorous living room below the window of Retrouvius with an old-fashioned copper light.
The golden furniture with the mirror surface, the silver details and the retro Serge Mouille luminaire highlight the style of the room.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatrics, space and saturation of light.
Both ends of the short corridor are fitted with mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the rear wall with the mirror makes it look like a window opening in the other room.
At the entrance, the mirror cabinet offers a storage space for all Joanne's cutlery and glassware.
The beauty of the living room is accompanied by the possibility of closing the kitchen part if it is not used, creating a more glamorous room.
The folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, there is a unique fact about this kitchen that it is a garage-type door that can be raised.
"It was a bit of a design effort," explains Erfan from the veneered MDF door with steel reinforcement.
"It has a counterweight, which is why it glides very easily when it is pushed up."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage, Joanne now has 16 extra square metres, an extra bedroom and a better apartment plan.
"After all, the floor area is what you sell - or what gives the property value," says Erfan.
"A real estate agent enters an outdated room and does calculations based on the floor area."
Here they have been able to increase the floor area, using high-quality materials that add luxury to the room.
"The materials are the ones you touch that help make an emotional connection to your home," says Erfan.
"You will not fall in love with the electrical cable in the wall.
It's important, but it doesn't make your heart ring. "
It shows that good design and increased area help to make quite an amazing apartment.
In fact, they may actually cause a desire not to leave, as happened with Joanne.
The protagonist, Dane Jensen, is a bounty hunter in a Chicago skyscraper, competing with a colleague for a promotion.
All that matters is the amount of money you earn, next to which you forget all ethics.
He only sees his wife and three kids in the morning and late.
In the first half of the film, I find myself thinking that this is a version of the business world - even Kevin Spacey and Gerard Butler's speech maneer are similar.
The more the film goes on, the less the frame-building element remains, and the moralizing intention of filmmakers is becoming more and more visible.
The life-changing experience becomes the protagonist's son's illness with cancer.
It is now up to us to make a choice between work and family life.
A son who dreams of being an architect makes his father take walks to the great buildings of Chicago to think about really important things, such as faith, goodness, love, not even the disaster of the twin towers.
After the third scene where the son opens his father's eyes, it seems that the filmmakers are determined to make the audience cry for sure, because even the most harshly heart-watcher cannot hold back tears in the sight of the suffering of a sweet, cancer-sick boy.
When a son falls into a coma and his situation seems almost hopeless, the father finally understands the morality of his work and does a good deed to an old man looking for a job.
Now I bet myself on my mind - if the movie has happy self, I'll reward my insights after the movie with coffee, but if I'm wrong, the writer can be praised for at least one surprise.
For a moment there's a suspicion that I'm gonna miss my coffee - when my husband calls Dane from the hospital, and he runs slow down the hall towards the room.
But the son has been wonderfully healed, and even though his father has just lost his job, it is also positive, because now is the time to deal with the family.
I can feel good too - I can predict the end of the American drama quite well!
In truth, the film is well-designed, and all the elements needed are there.
You can cry, you can laugh, the actors are good and the moral is beautiful: money is not the most important thing in life.
I'm sure this movie will bring in a good one.
Trump's new chief of staff is planning to limit the president's media consumption.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it for real.
In that case, he'd be the first.
Politico writes that the new head of staff of the White House is planning to limit the flow of information, including news, to President Trumpin, in the hope that it will keep the boss in a more level water.
There's a break from reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new head of staff of the White House, met with high-ranking officials on his first working day, he pointed out the key problem of President Donald Trump's White House, which he intended to solve by reaching out to the President for bad information.
Kelly told the officials that the information had to go through her, either on paper or at meetings, because the president would make better decisions if she had good information. "
Kelly's diagnosis seems perfectly logical, but others have tried, too, and they have failed to control Trump by monitoring her media consumption.
President Trump's relationship to television goes back decades, and even now that he's in the White House, his television viewing habits have not disappeared.
"If candidate Trump was upset about the dishonest media coverage, it was worth showing him that he was also fairly reflected in the publications affected," said former campaign advisor Sam Nunberg to Politico in February.
Politico Tara Palmer wrote at that time that "according to six former campaign professionals, the key to managing Trump's Twitter habits is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a song of praise on a stable basis."
All right.
But the idea that the habits of Trump Twitter have ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign workers know something that the rest of us do not know that Trump tweets would have been even more ignitable without these interventions.
We'll probably never know about the tweezers Trump didn't post.
If his associates managed to get him out of trouble a couple of times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from constantly creating controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House of competing clicks, people exclusively try to promote their own interests by passing material to Trump that supports their world views, but may not always be reliable.
Politico, who reflects the whole story, wrote in May about the counsel's tendency to feed the president information of strategic questionable value.
One of the examples described by reporter Shane Goldmacher is as follows:
"The current and former Trump subordinates say that Trump may react to a negative press, especially the damaging leaflets, explosively by obsessing to identify their source.
This was also the case at the end of February, when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article on the GotNews.com website, owned by the Internet pharmacist Charles C. Johnson, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of several leaflets" of the White House.
It does not matter that Johnson has been permanently blocked from Twitter by mockery or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has also made false accusations in the past and has withdrawn them.
Trump read the article and started asking the subordinates about Walsh. "
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff, Rence Priebus, and the White House's office chief, Rob Porter, "have attempted to establish a system for managing and documenting documents reaching Trumpin."
How did it work?
Kelly tries to do exactly the same thing three months later.
Maybe he's a more effective leader than Priebus, but Trump is still impulsive and his associates are still competing for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Street musicians who come from abroad to the capital do not get permission for a bitter performance.
A lot of foreigners go to the center of Tallinn to music.
Those of you who got the Air Hound to talk to admitted that they were playing in the old town without the permission of the government.
The first we found were three street musicians near the gates of Viru, who had taken as many dogs with them.
It was clear that musicians with Rastavad and broken clothes were backpack travelers who could use a shower.
Despite his appearance, the only woman in the group played a story with a fun rhythm on the accordion, while a man next to him juggled with three balls and called the bystanders closer.
The third man had sat next to them on one of his backpacks, and he smoked himself a twisted joint in peace of heart.
Their three dogs wouldn't let the passing people get in the way.
Bob, who played the accordion with Noem and the balls, told me they were playing on the streets for fun and money.
The purpose of the company was to collect the ticket money on the same day's evening for a ship sailing to Finland.
On the question of whether they asked the city for music in the old town, they shook Noem and Bob's head.
First of all, we didn't know.
Secondly, we never stay in one town for more than a day or two, and most of the time permits are given for a month or something like that.
There's no point in paying for it, "Bob explained.
When, about 20 minutes later, we came back to the gates of Viru, we saw that two women were with musicians and they were driving them away.
The company moved in with backpacks and dogs to the intersection of Viru Centre for happiness.
There were also three Polish young men on Viru Street, one playing violin, the other playing clarinet, and the third carrying an electronic piano.
"We are here to entertain people, to spread music and joy and to make money for fuel and living," explained the trio pianist Mivosh.
According to Mivoshi, they are aware that there must be a government permit to perform.
'Of course we don't have it, 'he said jokingly.
But we hope that when people enjoy our music, there will be no problem.
Of course, when the police come, we will go elsewhere, but we must try, "he added.
In July, the Bank of Estonia purchased EUR 149 million of bonds under the public asset purchase programme of the euro area central banks, while the central bank's bond portfolio grew to EUR 4.36 billion.
The Central Bank will not publish any more detailed information about the purchases.
Hardo Hansson, President of the Bank of Estonia, has made it clear in the past that the Eurosystem central banks' asset purchase programme includes three different purchase programmes: covered bonds in the financial sector, asset-backed bonds (ABS) and public sector bonds (PSPP).
The central bank buys bonds from the market in order to encourage investors who have sold bonds to invest money elsewhere.
Purchases have the effect of reducing the return on lower-risk assets and motivate investors to take higher risks.
As a general rule, each central bank buys its own government bonds under the public sector bond programme and no other national bonds are purchased.
As the Estonian State has not issued the bonds, the Bank of Estonia makes so-called replacement purchases within the volume allocated to them.
Replacement purchases are also made by central banks in those countries where the offer of bonds corresponding to the purchase plan is limited.
The Bank of Estonia, according to Hansson, generally buys European institutional bonds such as European Financial Stability Fund and European Investment Bank bonds.
Eesti Pank has been buying bonds under the asset purchase programme since March 2015.
In the meantime, Elering's bonds were also acquired, but the Bank of Estonia will no longer buy Elering's bonds from June 2016.
From June onwards, both Elering and Eesti Energia will purchase Finnish central bank bonds on behalf of the central banks of the euro area.
Travelers ignore the ditch and return to "millionaire district."
Some of the richest homeowners in the West Midlands have once again faced a fierce confrontation with determined travelers who have ignored the ditch dug up by the council in order to win back a field away from their villas.
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans in the field in a wealthy "millionaire district" near Solihull Street.
They have returned with the army of horses, children and trucks since they were kicked out of it only in May, without being disturbed by a ditch dug up by the council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical team found a weak spot in the guard, squeezing their vehicles through the unblocked part left on foot.
The angry people are the rogue Council of Solihull, saying that the council is "useless in dealing with the problem."
An anonymous resident said, "They moved there Monday night after they were driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at bystanders.
The Council must be disgraced to take action because they are useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, they were driven away, and now they're back again.
More came in last night, probably even more today. "
He added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with such matters by obtaining long barriers to protect its parks.
I live on Streetsbrook, and I am not satisfied that I have to continue to pay the council tax if the council cannot even prevent such a thing. "
A local resident who also wanted to remain anonymous said: 'This is ridiculous. We just saw the last of these travelers leave, and there is already a new attack.
This time the number has increased and even the horse has been seen in ruminants on grassland. "
The representative of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware that there is an unacceptable campsite in the land near Streetsbrook Road and we are working with the Solihull police. We are implementing the necessary legal measures to get them moving as quickly as possible.
It will be very helpful to gather evidence if as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This will help create a picture of the situation for the court when we present the case to them. "
The Weekend Festival is visited by Indrek Saar, the Minister of Culture, among others, who is pleased to have been able to bring real world top names to Estonia.
The question of why the Weekend festival is so important to Estonians is answered by Saar that it should be asked of all those who enjoy the festival three days in a row.
But he does realize that the true people of his profession have come to Pärnu.
"Looking at the level of artists that they have been able to bring to Estonia, the absolute top names of this music genre are being brought home - this often does not happen in our neighbourhood," says the Minister of Culture.
Which artists at the festival do the island speak most of all?
I consider myself a relatively old man, and for old people like me, I'm sure one of the most experienced artists is Armin van Buuren, who stepped up last night.
After all, according to his record-twirling, at some point all of us have been spinning our feet, "he says.
But he does bring up a number of names, like Chainsmokers, Deadmau5, Knifeparty.
Our own Estonian makers, of course: starting with NOÁP and you can read a whole series of them.
In reality, this concentration of well-known names is very high, "he says.
Take a look at the big video of the evening light!
Audi updates up to 850 000 diesel vehicles in the middle of criticism of car manufacturers
The day before Audi's announcement, BMW said that it was offering software upgrades for more than 350,000 vehicles.
According to the BMW Chairman, the company believes that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions', referring to European cities, including the BMW hometown, Munich, which has considered banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will upgrade three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies described these acts as recall.
European car manufacturers have actively promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, nitric oxide emitted from diesel engines is considered to be a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
The cost of equipment to be installed to neutralise emissions from diesel vehicles for automotive companies will also increase, making it difficult to keep car prices competitive.
While German car manufacturers are under thorough investigation, the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of pampering powerful car manufacturers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
Companies are trying to avoid repeating the mistakes of Volkswagen, who stopped using so-called scammers, which allowed the exhaust gas reading to be adjusted to the regulations during the test of the car, but withdrew in normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen leaders have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the Thermodynamics Unit of the Audi Engine Development Department was arrested in Germany.
Former chairman Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and can be prosecuted in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was pulled into a criminal investigation into Volkswagen in Germany when the authorities accused the audit of installing the system in order to circumvent the requirements of European exhaust emissions, thus extending the investigation which had previously been focused on the United States.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation may be a major blow to Volkswagen's luxury car manufacturer generates a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen's profits.
Estonian schools receive EU flags for EUR 20 000.
The Ministry of Education intends to buy EU flags for Estonian schools by 1 September to mark the Presidency.
In total, 105x158 centimetres of educational establishments of the EU flag 570.
The flags are intended to be displayed indoors; they must be carried out in high-quality printing equipment indoors with a tunnel fastening, mediated by the ERR news portal.
The flag rod label has the following text: "Gift to Estonian schools to mark the first presidency of the Estonian Council of the European Union.
The estimated cost of 570 flags is EUR 20 000 for the Ministry of Education, or EUR 35 for one flag.
The murder of a journalist highlights a growing threat to Mexico.
Weekly Riodoce employees usually gather on Wednesday to review plans to reflect the most recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa, sown by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But today they have gathered in the shadow of personal tragedy to discuss their own safety.
They're told it's important to change their routine.
Two senior writers will discuss which seems safer: either bring the children to the office, which was the target of the grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on the board at the head of the room: "enemies," "neutral," "allies."
They ask reporters to name every column, no evidence, just impressions and gut.
The government or cartels are suspected of being employed by drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists, a whole list of villains who make it dangerous to reflect the chaos in Mexico.
There is no break in breath from the violence, and the more dead bodies accumulate across the country, the greater the proportion of them being made up by journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, have been at least 25 since the declaration of President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012. 589 journalists have been under state protection following attacks and threats, and this year at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The latest deaths include their editor and source of inspiration, co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," said Valdez, in one of his many books on drug violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence can be perceived anywhere in the facade of the Riodoce building, hanging a large picture of the middle finger-pointing Valdez with the letter "Justice" and two 30-year-old reporters, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing T-shirts, depicting his smiling face or his panamata hat.
The meeting will take place less than two months after his death, while the reporters discuss a common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a separate state prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists' cases, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, only two cases have been prosecuted.
As with most of the annual drug trafficking and organised crime-related murders, which amount to thousands, journalists' killers rarely come to justice.
The Riodoce editorial work continues to reflect the violence in Sinaloa, even though their hearts are broken and the landscape is now even more dangerous.
Without the data and justice of the murderers, the safety meeting, Ibarra said, will not be of much use.
"It's very silly to waste your time in this meeting," he says.
"Until you know why, you distrust everyone."
Valdez left the Riodoce office in Culiacan, state capital, on the morning of May 15th.
He only managed to drive a few blocks before two men stopped his red Toyota Corolla, forced to get out of the car and shot him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which translated into "the 12th River."
The armed man drove away in Valdez's car and crashed near it.
Valdez was 50 years old.
She left behind a woman and two grown-up children.
Rumors spread freely in Culiacan.
However, there is essentially only silence on the subject of Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has been one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, because rivalry factions are fighting to fill the power vacuum.
It doesn't matter that the streets of Sinaloa are being shot every day by a few or even several people, or that the graveyard is crawling with abundantly adorned double of the mausoleum of drug kings that are bigger than many living homes.
Let us forget for a moment that the times of peace indicate how valuable ports and drug routes to the United States are controlled by only one cartel.
Despite all this and the fact that Valdez was fully aware of the dangers of his work, Riodoce, co-founder and director of Ismail Bojorquez (60), feels enormous guilt that he was unable to protect his friend.
He believes the killing was facilitated by two mistakes.
The first was the publication in February of an interview with the head man Damaso Lopez of the cartel, who competes with the sons of Guzman and is at war.
This piece of paper may have pissed off the sons of the suspected gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they got into the newsstands.
The second mistake was that Valdez was not forced to leave the country for his own safety after a raid took place in another newspaper that reflected the same story.
Valdez was a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a turning point in violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always exist.
He worked for Noroeste in 2003 as a veteran reporter when he joined five colleagues to create Riodoce, selling 50-dollar shares.
Bojorquez said that Sinaloa "was impossible to do the press without touching the drug problem."
Over time, the newspaper gathered its bold and honest echoes, and sales and advertising increased.
The reporters liked to publish strong research without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by printing, from which they could read stories that no one else dared to reflect.
Eight years after Riodoce was founded, the newspaper won its Latin American echoes for the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Prize.
In the same year, the Valdez Committee for the Protection of Journalists (AKK) won the International Prize for Freedom of the Press for its courage to follow the Mexican drug story wherever it leads.
He admitted openly that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said by accepting the AKK Prize.
Last October, in an interview with Rompeviento TV, he said that drug trafficking was a way of life in Sinaloa.
"You have to take on the task of being a journalist is another way to play dumb.
I don't want to be asked what I did in the face of so many deaths or why I didn't tell you what was going on. "
The Riodoce Collective longs for Valdez, a joker who used to curse like a sailor, a friend who graciously shared arms and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They were relying on his routine.
He always wore his hat.
He went from the office to the El Guayabo bar across the street and always sat at the same table.
Now they're asking if his routine love was fatal to him.
His death has also led them to question themselves as to how best to do their job and survive.
"They don't like you messing with their women, their children, their legitimate businesses, their secret landing sites used to transport drugs."
"These things were not to be touched," said Bojorquez.
The result is a strong self-censorship and self-preservation even in the best times.
Trusting your instincts.
If it smells suspicious, stay away.
According to Andres Villarreal, editor of Riodoce, the problem is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and that's how it happened to Javier."
He and others say that the old rules no longer apply in Sinaloa, just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero or other states that are home to the toxic composition of profitable smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt public officials.
Landscape changes all the time.
In the room where Riodoce's staff were assembled for security training, mobile phones were suddenly no longer allowed; a few days before that, it was revealed that only spyware sold to governments had been used to track journalists and activists in Mexico.
In front of the house, two police officers were searching in the shade of a tree for relief from the 40-degree heat.
The government has assigned them to guard the Riodoce office, located in a four-storey building in Culiacan's middle-class neighbourhood.
Some reporters were wondering if these police officers were among the 50 percent policemen whose governor himself has been acting untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters have traveled to the mountainous countryside, where the de facto drug gangs are in control.
Riodoce this week's edition covered three main stories.
One of them was the murder of the brother of former boxing legend Julio César Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had a revealing story about spending government money on the governor's hometown.
And a group of people were kidnapped from one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the DA's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was time to be careful to write what everyone in town knows is a favourite place for both drug traffickers and public authorities.
The reporter learned from public documents that the restaurant was registered as a politician in the institutional revolution party in power (IRP), which dominated all levels of politics almost throughout the last century.
Recently, several governors of the IRP have been accused of corruption with widespread coverage in cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in the same place, including how the son of Guzman, wearing the nickname El Chapo, got away with a military alert.
Just a few months earlier, the readers would have been looking for the Valdez column to get information on the kidnapping from the best sources.
'We would have known what happened before, 'said the 46-year-old Villarreal, whose sticker body structure has earned him the nickname El Flaco.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources have been cut off."
Valdez's office has become a storage room for labels and stickers that protest against the killing of journalists, and the editorial staff have become something they never expected of activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a couple of signs and went to the local prosecutor's office the next morning for a demonstration for another journalist.
Salvador Adama disappeared to the west of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been found, and the officials say it belongs to him on DNA tests.
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country and are scribbling the phrase "SOS press" as an organised protest on the sidewalks and buildings.
On this day, President Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
The day after Valdez died, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
After that, he asked that he be diverted from the government's activities, concerned that anger had influenced his objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that Mexican journalists were "surrounded" by organised crime, complicit public officials and indifferent society.
In his latest book "The Drug Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also by orders from politicians and security forces who are involved in organised crime.
Last year, more than half of the attacks on journalists were attributed to the police and public officials by the Media Follow-up Group, Articulo 19.
"In Mexico, you will die because they want to shut you up," said Ramirez.
The murders are obviously very bleak.
Nobody forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
His body was found with a letter probably signed by a cartel in Los Zeta, "I'm here for my reports."
Next to his decapitated head, there were computer flaps and headphones.
Some publications have decided to close their doors, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after their correspondent Miroslava Breach was killed in March.
Others continue as the newspaper El Manana de Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their manager in 2004.
In 2010, the newspaper Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a editorial "What do you want from us?" on the front page.
Some journalists have fled their home states or even their country.
It's a nervous decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they still have to paddle the streets to avoid danger.
And sometimes they're being chased, as probably happened with the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in one of Mexico's apartments three months after he fled Veracruz.
Those who remain in place and continue to work must dance around risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who wanted to be a poet once, admits that reporting the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is on its way to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight on a recent Friday, when the latest number had already been locked, Riodoce's editors sat in front of the office on the sidewalk and drank beer when suddenly everyone's phones started vibrating.
In the coastal resort town of Mazatlan, 19 people had been killed in shootings between rival gangs and security forces, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to escalate, as many of the messages left by the cartels found in the region promised.
From the edge of that pavement, the reporters put the news up on the Riodoce website using a mobile phone.
The front page of the next day needed to be changed.
The sirens were hovering through another shootout in the area.
Bojorquez peeked at the policemen on duty to see if they were vigilant.
If they were afraid, at least they didn't show it.
The newspaper's fallen founder under a massive portrait, on which his middle finger can be seen throughout Sinaloa, was edited by Riodoce's employees in his footsteps.
'How can I even think about closing, 'said Bojorquez,' when, on the same day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send him to the streets for a report? '
Dinosaurus used a protective colour to prevent enemies.
At first glance, it seems like a statue, though quite frightening.
Scientists have now released the first findings of an incredible rhino-size being discovered by a Canadian miner, which has been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."
It is so well preserved that it was even possible to identify that his scalp-covered skin was reddish-brown and his past had been somewhat "complicated."
The report published in Current Biology described the creature as "the best-preserved dinosaur that has ever been found" and as "one of the best dinosaurs in the world."
Fossil is a new nodosaurus species that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, 110-112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good survival struck scientists who describe it as "truly remarkable."
This armored vegetarian is, according to National Geographic, best preserved this type of fossil that has ever been found.
This was found on 21 March 2011 by Shawn Funk when he mined Suncor Millenium in a mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta in Canada.
He struck something that did not resemble the surrounding stone, and decided to examine it further.
The discovered fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
For the next six years, they worked to dig an animal out of an area of 2500 pounds (1100 kilos).
After all this hard work, the final result is now finally ready to be made public.
"With a bit of a squint of eyes, you can almost believe he's asleep," said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is exposed.
"It goes down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
By looking at his skin, scientists found that this plant eater, though covered with scales and resembling a walking tank, was likely to be significantly threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The dinosaur, which was rich in scales, used red and white to hide from predators, and applied a cloaking technique called counter-eclipse, which is also used by many animals today.
According to the experts, this enabled the dinosaurs to blend in better and avoid enemies, as larger dinosaurs were likely to hunt them.
This 110-million-year-old nodosaurus family creature has first reached the news in May and is now visited by the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum.
Scientists have now studied the creature and named it after Mark Mitchell, the lab laboratory at the Borealopelta Markmitchell Museum, who was part of a team that spent more than 7000 hours trying to expose the animal.
Thanks to the astonishingly good preservation of the specimen, Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scientists were able to document the shape and size of the scales on the animal's body.
They discovered an eclipse - a method of protection common in the animal kingdom, which means that the upper half of the creature was darker than the lower.
Although the eclipse is widespread, the findings come as a surprise, as Borealopelta is much larger than the animals that live today with the eclipse.
It suggests that the dinosaur was sufficiently actively hunted by other flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution preferred hiding as a survival tactics instead of confrontation.
But most animals that use modern eclipses, such as deer, zebras or armadils, are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had to work really hard to survive.
"The vigorous hunting of a huge dinosaur with a large and large scales shows how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous could have been," says Brown.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds of the scales also revealed that the dinosaur skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to study an animal to get clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its gut, to find out what the animal ate for its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river when he died, thereby reaching the sea with the flow, where he sank his back in front of the ocean floor.
At that time Albertas was as warm as it is now in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to reach far further inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scaly skin, but it has also remained three-dimensional, maintaining the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal today looks almost the same as in the Cretaceous age.
You don't have to use too much imagination to reconstruct it - just squinting your eyes and it's like she's asleep. "
The Cretaceous era was a time when on Earth huge flesh-eating dinosaurs were wandering on two legs - teropods.
Although their all King Tyrannosaurus rex lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could be hunted by some of his terrifying predecessors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 metres) long monster weighing six tonnes.
Scientists, whose recent findings have been published in the Current Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta washed up after death into the sea and it mummified in the mud.
The creature was discovered on March 21, 2011 by Shawn Funk when he was mining a Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in North Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and scales, and it is a complete cone to the hips.
These creatures were on average 18 feet (five metres) long and weighed up to GBP 3000 (1300 kg).
Two 20-inch spikes broke out of its shoulders.
Scientists believe that this armored vegetation eater adventured through the present West Canada until the flooded river into its open sea washed.
But the undersea site of the dinosaur helped maintain its scales in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the bumpy scales along the skull of the dinosaur are still covered by the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote in National Geographic magazine, "This degree of survival is as rare as a lottery victory.
The more I look at it, the more incredible it seems.
The stoned skin remains still covering the humid scales on the skull of the animal.
The right front leg lies next to him, and five toes are stretched upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole. "
How did an activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was in complete shock.
Just the day after travelling to New York, this St. Louis resident was sitting in a room rented through Airbnb, browsing Facebook on his phone.
He got on the post of his old schoolmate.
It said, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid and he's still on the street."
He was confused about why no one else had posted this information to his stream, which is why he closed down Facebook and opened Twitter.
The continuous @ TheePharoah user posts were repeatedly shared along its timeline.
A rapper from the St. Louis region has relayed a real-time tweet about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man killed by a white cop in Missouri, Ferguson.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body lying on the street, staying there for four hours.
"This is crazy," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to him or his community.
He hung up on his phone, but he saw the tweaks later this evening that reported people gathering in Canfield Drive.
Photos of police tape and screaming people and a man who claimed to be Brown's father and kept a sign saying "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
He looked at the flow in real time, where a cop was standing in front of a group of protestors with a barking dog.
In the second video, another cop, according to him, pulled a gun and screamed, "I'm gonna kill you all... animals."
Ferrell remembers how he caught himself thinking, "It's unusual."
"This is not the kind of murder we're used to and we could call typical."
I felt the creeps of fear at the time.
I was angry and I cried. "
He booked a return flight and drove home the next day.
After landing at 11: 00, he went to his father to pick up his six-year-old daughter and decided they were going to Ferguson alone the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is a central topic in the new documentary "Who Streets?" ("Whose streets?"), which will be premiered in cinemas on 11 August.
This is the story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and toughness from the point of view of the people who live in this community and who filled the streets with answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter - who had a flower dress on her back and a crown in her head - went to Ferguson, they again talked about a subject that they had repeatedly talked about before this morning - about the experiences and living conditions of the black people.
"Do you remember when I taught you how the black community had to fight for its rights?" he reminds me of asking himself.
"We're going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, and that's not right."
"I couldn't take him with me," said Ferrell later.
"What is happening now is... the culmination of what has happened in the past.
He needs to know and see it and grow in the middle of it.
He must learn about activism and organisation and, at the same time, know the different layers of black experience and living conditions, and what we must do to get free and free ourselves.
Even if I manage to raise him without personally experiencing presumptuous racism, he's no different from another black girl.
I feel like I would do him a disservice if I could protect him from this world. "
The first stop they made when they got to Ferguson was on their way to South Florissant, a place across the street from the police station, which had become a sort of campsite where activists were waiting for news about Officer Darren Wilson, who was not finally charged.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined forces with a local business owner who made lunch.
They put the groceries together and helped share them with the protestors.
For Ferrell, new types of activism slowly began to take shape.
"My activism changed completely after 9 August," he said, noting that when he was a student at Missouri-St. Louis University, he was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I didn't have any organization experience.
It just worked out. "
Weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell met a film co-director of Sabaah Folayan.
Folayan said he and the film operator Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document what was happening.
The question came to Ferrell's head: "Are you trying to document what's going on or find a story that can be used?"
Such scepticism was due to countless cases where people - often white - come into the community and try to benefit from its pain and endurance.
Folayan explained in a recent interview: 'We had heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson were not heard, and we wished to do it differently'.
Folayan had already struck hands with co-director Damon Davis, an artist in the region known for activism in connection with sentenced prisoners.
His involvement made the project attractive to Ferrell and six other locals who were watched by the "Who Streets?" team for years after Brown was shot.
"In this documentary, no one speaks for us or for us, but we speak for ourselves," said Davis.
"It was important to me how these people were portrayed, because that was how I was portrayed."
Although the aim was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - it was intended to show that the movement was not a "redeemable guide, but a community reunion," as Mr Folayan said - it became the most open part of the film.
As a result, "Who Streets?" is surprisingly documenting personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as falling in love and marrying his wife.
'I felt as if I was naked, 'said Ferrell, laughing at the first time he saw the finished linen.
"But I realized that doing this job and humanizing black people must be accompanied by a certain degree of vulnerability."
What is more, the story of Ferrell highlights and replaces the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three initiators of the movement, who, in the social media in 2012, came up with a reference # BlackLivesMatter after the murder of a black teenager Trayvon Martin, are homosexual.
"Black homosexual women, in their leading role, have generally maintained their movement," said Ferrell, 'precisely because we must constantly fight on several fronts.
Black homosexual women must bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed by stating that "the movement is indeed kept alive by black women, and many of them are black homosexual women."
However, it argues that "this is not some kind of equal opportunity thing" - Ferrell was not chosen as the centre of the film because of its identity.
"He was the person who blew up the right energy," he said.
"But it's not a coincidence that he was right on the front line, because as a black homosexual woman, living at such nodes, there's a lot at stake.
His energy can be perceived through the screen. "
At the same time, news cameras from Ferguson have long disappeared, but racial ties between the community and the police are still fragile.
The conditional sentence imposed on Ferrell during the demonstration for blocking the road will last for a further 2.5 years.
He describes the social policy climate in the region he calls home, simply 'a huge threat'.
Nevertheless, he still attaches importance to the mantra he's been feeding into his memory since he went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
"Our duty is to fight for our freedom.
It's our responsibility to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains. "
Seven tricks to get over the hangover after Weekend's party.
Some of the strongest male sons find after a drink-rich party that's bad enough to help.
Or they're talking about "avoid hangover, stay drunk."
But it's just an inevitable postponement and a decent blow to health.
What can you do to make yourself feel better in the morning and get over the hangover as painlessly as possible after tonight and tomorrow?
Drink some water.
Down to the liquor and after, after the big party in the morning... or possibly not even for the alcohol.
Since the body loses a lot of fluid while drinking alcohol, somehow it needs to be recovered.
Mineral substances are also washed out of the body with water and it is good to drink mineral water.
Since the stomach is often irritated after drinking, it is particularly good if it is bubble-free or only slightly carbonated.
Go for a walk.
I'm sure it wouldn't cost a hangover to break trees at Grandma's - that could be a fatal mistake.
But a little walk will help the body remember what it feels like to be alive again.
Lying in a tent and sleeping out a hangover is a more time-consuming way to heal.
Give the body energy back slowly and carefully.
If you're going to puke already from last night's overdrinking, I'm sure it's not worth trying to get a big fat steak out of your stomach.
Start with fresh juice, for example, which contains fruit sugar, and slowly starts to support your body.
If you already have health problems around lunch, you might want to try some broth.
And a little later on, the backside.
Avoid coffee.
This diuretic will release every last piece of water in your body.
Like I said, water and juice are your friends.
Don't bet on painkillers.
If you take a painkiller to prevent a hangover in the evening, your liver will have to deal with paracetamol or ibuprofen in addition to alcohol, and it will result in loss of performance.
That way you ruin your liver even more, and in the future, the hangover will be worse.
Plus, the painkiller doesn't last very long in the body anyway.
If you take a painkiller in the morning, don't do it on an empty stomach, it'll irritate your already bruised stomach.
Or if you don't have a partner, get along well with yourself.
It works about the same way as walking, but you don't get an orgasm when you walk.
However, avoid too much active speed and crazy postures - physical effort should be moderate during hangover.
You gotta be kidding me.
You talk stupid to your friends and mates, you do simple stupid things, and you laugh friendly about yourself and everyone else.
Joke and laughter may not be a hangover, but it's certainly more fun to take after-effects with them.
One day the hangover will pass anyway!
Northwestern Professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder.
Police say they're looking nationwide for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who's become suspects after they found the body of a man with deadly stab wounds in a luxury apartment in Chicago.
According to the Cook County court records, on Monday, no bail-out warrants were issued for the arrest of 42-year-old Wyndham Lathen and 56-year-old Andrew Warren for the murder of the first degree because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau.
According to the records, 26-year-old Cornell-Duranleau died after repeated stabbing.
According to a warning issued to the community by the Chicago Police Department, the body was discovered on July 27.
The cops got a phone call and found a victim with multiple puncture wounds on his body when he arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartment.
Officials say Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene, and investigators consider stabbing as murder, while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lathen has been a co-professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President of the University of Public Relations, said in a statement sent by e-mail that Lathen was now temporarily suspended and was prohibited from entering the University of Northwestern.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities, and the University of Northwestern is cooperating with the investigators," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior assistant at the Oxford University Finance Department.
A representative of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement: "We have been in contact with the British police and are prepared to assist US research institutions in any way possible."
In addition, the statement stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to turn himself in.
Anthony Guglielmi, Head of Communication at the Chicago Police Department, strongly recommends that suspects turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea where they are, but we are increasingly engaged in defining the exact location," said Guglielmi.
According to Guglielm, local, regional and national authorities are helping to search for suspects.
Guglielmi said the police got a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment building, who had just received an cryptic tip that something had happened in apartment 1008.
According to police reports, it was a hideous sight.
According to Guglielm, it is not clear whether the event itself took place on 27 July.
He said security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
'We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship, 'added Guglielm.
The leadership of Grand Plaza sent a letter to the people saying: "Police are currently working on the chronology of events and the background of the victim and are investigating various motives, including the possibility of a family dispute."
Start-ups that help your company avoid becoming the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure her e-commerce start-up employee satisfaction, but the polls were useless.
The answers were often vague, useless or, worse still, misleading.
And even if he promised to ensure anonymity, some employees did not trust this process.
"This system was simply not consistent and objective," said Errett, who runs an e-commerce company, Madison Reed, selling hair products with 75 employees in San Francisco.
So he called for help from outside parties.
New types of human resources start-ups are emerging to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software with a specific aim of measuring employee involvement, they allow companies to conduct sudden surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, provide workers with anonymity and a hot line of complaints and, in some cases, allow language bearers to pass through level C managers and turn directly to the board.
"Now there are tools like Strava and Fitbit, which are designed to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" asked Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of the Redwood City start-up company Gint, whose software analytical tools are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
According to Errett, in the three years he's been using Glint, he's got a much better view of what his employees are thinking and feeling.
In addition to quick surveys and surveys directed at specific teams, it provides the company's heat map, which gives an overview of which departments have the most complaints and which managers have the lowest support, enabling it to identify the reasons.
Businesses have begun to realise that they need to stay up to date with their work culture so as not to become the next Uber, which has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an abusive environment that punished those who dared to speak.
For start-ups like Gint, the desire to have an overview is a profitable business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance area may be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the data on the Financial Technology Statistics website Let's Talk Payments.
Conversent, a start-up company operating in Denver, in Colorado, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behaviour, observed an increase in interest and activity this year against the background of Uber's dubious reputation.
Conversent has almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently registered as a client.
Like Glink, Convercent allows companies to send custom impulse polls, collect real-time confidential answers and look at heat maps in problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous messaging line allowing workers to report inappropriate behaviour.
And when it comes to the CEO, complaints go directly to the board.
"Public opinion has been usurped by regulators," said Conversent founder and CEO Patrick Quinlan.
Quinlan said that if it is found that a company treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, the company may face serious consequences such as consumer boycott, workers' departure and litigation, even if the regulatory authorities do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 25 000 employees at 500 sites, has been using Convercenter for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to provide a simple way of communicating with corporate headquarters.
If an employee wanted to report a problem earlier, he had to find a phone number or e-mail address at the corporate headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a discouraging and uncomfortable process, said Ruby Tuesday's general advisor, James Vitrano, who said that there was no good way to monitor employees' complaints.
However, now that the company is using Conversent, problems such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage practices that have not previously reached the leaders who were active in offices in other cities or states can be identified and dealt with more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic 360-degree experience of employees," said Vitrano, who runs the Ruby Tuesday risk management group.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
Quinlan said that companies began to take ethical behaviour, values and employee involvement much more seriously in 2002, after the audit firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations in connection with the Enron scandal.
But it was only when "social media matured" that companies realised that they could not prevent them from washing their dirty laundry publicly online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethical behaviour, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Gint and Convercent offer their software as a service by charging companies a periodic fee for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity with the approval of venture capital investors, who have been supporting both start-ups.
Conversent was financed in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital worth USD 10 million, thereby raising the value of the capital raised to USD 47 million.
In November, Glint was invested $10 million in Bessemer Venture Partners, increasing its total funding to $60 million.
Such investments do not come as a surprise given the interconnectedness between businesses, culture and venture capital.
More and more studies show that modern workers expect more from the job than they did in the past.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are merely on the table.
Workers want to feel accepted and valued and devote their time to a company that has a positive mission.
"If people are happy in the company, feel that they are being listened to and that the work they are doing is satisfying, they are more committed to ensuring the success of the company," said Nina McQueen, Vice-President of the Department for General Benefits and Workers' Experience in Linkedin, which uses both Conversent and Glint.
Investors earn a profit if their portfolio is well run by companies; companies are well run when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools allow for greater commitment and involvement of workers, it is no wonder that they will find support.
It is important to have data on employee involvement, according to the professionals of the work culture.
However, these data are useless if the company's supervisors do nothing about it.
In fact, if a company asks its employees for feedback, it can create expectations that changes will be needed.
And if the changes do not happen fast enough or not at all, they can cause disappointment and reduce employee involvement.
"If you are asking for 4000 proposals, you must be ready for 4000 interviews," said the president of Kotter International, a consultancy and business management company, Russell Raath, who has seen companies making a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
"For if things are not finished, the workers will think," Did you actually listen to me?
Do you care?
And if you don't care, why should I care? "
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who is now carrying out monthly surveys of workers, has been able to implement the measures on the same day that the problem has been reported through Glint.
And after receiving feedback from staff disappointed in the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, he was able to reorganise several teams in the company and provide communication training to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesdays, however, new data on workers are collected and it is expected that in the long term this will lead to a longer-term commitment of workers in the industry, known for its high turnover.
"If you are not committed to transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies. "
The bright star of the euro area is the Baltics: incomes are growing fast
Although the crisis in 2008 and the trade problems with Russia have had an impact on the Baltic States, the three Baltic States are rapidly approaching the income of the rich countries of Western Europe, Bloomberg writes, with reference to the report by the European Central Bank.
According to the Central Bank, since 1999, gross economic output per capita has exceeded expectations in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
Progress is driven by low debt, rapidly improving institutions and a business and free market-friendly policy.
"The Baltic States, together with Slovakia, are among the few countries in the euro area where real GDP per capita has approached the EU average significantly," announced the Central Bank.
Although the aim is to ensure that total per capita economic output equals the richer Western Europe, in 2015, the total per capita output of the Baltic economies was only 2 / 3 of the average of 15 countries that were members of the European Union before the 2004 enlargement round.
Low wages have led the Baltic to seek better wages from abroad.
Although the European Central Bank sees the Baltic countries in a positive light and the economy is growing this year too, the local population is not enthusiastic at all.
According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only a quarter of Latvian and Lithuanian residents estimated that their economies were doing very well or rather well.
In the Czech Republic and Poland, a little less than half of the respondents thought this was the case for the economies of their countries.
NCAA's decision to cancel twice daily workouts makes Bruins' days long
It's almost 23: 00 when a bunch of UCLA football players stop for a chat at the edge of the new training ground on the team campus.
Some of them have stripped off their shirt, exposing their training camp's first day's efforts to a sweaty back.
For a large part of the crew, these idle minutes offer a break from noon.
Players taking part in the summer courses will go back to the dorm for final examinations after three hours of training before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for meetings next morning at 6.30.
"The next three days will be a real challenge for them," said Bruins' coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA's decision to cancel the two-day exercise to reduce the burden on players has in fact extended their days - at least until completion of finals on Friday.
For this reason, UCLA's first three training sessions were scheduled to begin at 19.15 in order to fit in with the player's already tight schedule.
The transition from two workouts a day means more days with one workout - Bruins' training camp started almost a week ahead compared to last season, and for the first time in Mora's six Westwood seasons, training takes place during summer courses.
They will have 18 training courses until 20 August before the formal preparations for the opening game in September against Texas A & M.
According to Mora, he is in favour of the NCAA's change of policy, although it adds another item to the players' frequent schedules.
"They have an enormous burden on three or four days, and this is a serious challenge," said Mora.
"And they break through this ordeal; they struggle; they are great young.
I believe that when Saturday comes and we have more time, it will be really nice. "
When the camp is over, UCLA's workouts will be closed, which is not an easy task, given the clear view of the parking lot near their squares and the adjacent Lukin centre, a higher class hotel that has already been hit by footballs around the gate post.
Since this weekend, Bruins' players have occupied the hotel, but Mora has admitted that there may be problems with free rooms during the season.
"We're taking security measures," said Mora.
"This is a real concern and it is not exaggerated to think that people can rent a room and then film training.
If you have a record of training, you can make a pretty good deal with it.
But we'll use a security team there and in the 8th parking lot.
We'll do our best to use what we have.
I'm trying not to worry too much about that.
We have a plan in place. "
The Savisiare-Ivanova Electoral Union, born for Revenge to the Centre Party, Kristiina Ojuland, disbanded from the Reform Party, and Maria Kaljus, who was forced to leave the ETRE, has been set up to show our Tallinn and the party party leaders a hopeful professional election union, Tegus Tallinn - it seems that electoral alliances created on the initiative of those who have been burned by party politics will participate at least as much in local elections this year as parties.
The chicks, however, are considered in the autumn, and the key question will be whether there are enough disappointed voters for all of them.
Who's staying with Savisland?
When the support of Edgar Savisaare has been reduced to a small extent, it is possible to anticipate the events organised in honor of his election union.
One member of the Riigikogu, some former and current middle-life soldiers and many unknown faces - is this what it will be like to be a constituency?
And is there any reason why some of Savisaar's loyal followers and friends are avoiding running in Tallinn? Is it possible to look at the fact that the evaders' "Savisare List ', led by the corruptors and suspects of corruption crimes, are becoming a reality?
The music video on the roof of the city government on the Russian pop song, in which the mayor of the district of Lasnamäe is involved; and in all respects the primitive computer game, in which the main character, Prime Minister Jüri Ratas, has to avoid slopes and squirrels on the wheel - is this how the Centre Party seeks for the first time the votes of 16 and 17-year-old voters who are allowed to join the ballot boxes?
We look forward to seeing other parties' perceptions of a youth election campaign as well.
If Channel 2 or TV3 looks at a black square instead of an entertainment show from the beginning of August, there are two options: to accept that only ETV, ETV2, ETV +, Tallinn TV and France24 channels will be available in the future, or to hand over to a TV operator every month.
There are probably also those who will be publicly happy at first about the advertising-free television experience, but in the end - albeit reluctantly - pay for television pictures and advertisements.
The closing music, the noisy people and the trash left on the streets are unpleasant side effects of almost every major music festival.
If you don't want to be a part of the song, you should go home to discover your country instead of hurting your head at home - and leave the place to the festival guests for a sizable amount of money.
Washington changes the green card rules
The media are quoting President Donald Trump, who says that a new US immigration plan is planned, which changes the rules of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50 000 people per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules have been proposed by the Republicans and are supported by the President.
The bill is going to be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars in taxpayers' money by changing the way in which the US issues green cards to citizens from other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the current programme.
The new application process will give an advantage to candidates who speak English and who have financial resources to support themselves and skills that will benefit our economy, "said Trump, according to the United States media publications.
Siberian seto kids move into town, retired people back to the country.
Yevseyev Anatoly continues the tradition of once famous seto gold miners on the Riverside of the Mana River.
He works 140 kilometers from home in a gold brick by the Maana River Kuwai as a car driver.
This is a tough job: 12 hours of work for two months straight without rest days and then only ten days at home and back again.
Anatoly has only seen gold once in the three years he worked in the army.
"There is a great deal of order: when you go in, you will be thoroughly checked that you do not bring vodka, and when you go out, you will not take gold," says Anatoly.
Mare Piho chatting in Haida village with local seto Jaan, who has told him a lot about the memories of his family in Siberia.
The remaining archaic culture of Siberian settos is also beginning to affect home setos, because it is just so amazing, thinks the most thoroughly remote setos examined by Piho Mare.
It will be 30 years since his first research trip to Siberia.
In that time, he's been there 14 times and lived there for a year.
How many settlers did he go out to Siberia at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century to get the land here?
It's an unsolved question.
I say 8,000.
I calculated it from the stories of the Siberian seto men who have thought about it themselves.
It's hard to say exactly, because there could have been up to 30 people in one group at the time, but the passport was only given to a man.
The passport was given to only one, but he had children, sisters and other female relatives.
Look at the size of this territory!
It was many times bigger than the historic Sematoa.
It had to be educated, managed in some way.
The Setos came here as peasants, but their lives changed, because here they ended up in areas not only related to agriculture, but also to the river (pilgrimage), to gold mines, to industry.
For example, in New Petseri, many setos later went to work in the classified city Krasnojarsk-45 (where the Soviet power built the uranium enrichment plant - J. P.) when it was formed.
Did the setos make up the majority of the population in this region at the time?
Yeah, they lived in a compact way.
In addition, the tradition of marriage and multi-childrenwas long preserved.
Seven or eight kids in the family were normal.
How much did the Siberian Seto culture differ and differ from the native Seto?
They're different, even though what was brought here was once the same there.
They brought a lot of folk clothes.
They made their own (folk clothes) then, but they always made a distinction between what had been brought along and what had been done here.
Climate change had a strong impact on the traditional clothes of the Setos, because it's colder here.
Food's changed.
For example, the meat was salted in Setomaa, but it was just frozen here.
Where are the Siberian Seto villages and what lives are lived there? / Graphics: Alari Paluots
The connection to the mother was spiritually strong, which was considered to be very important.
It seems to me that now this Setumaa is going to give back to it, start affecting them.
These girls who have lived in these families have listened to amazing stories.
Piho refers to the people of the delegation of Estonian Seto who came to Haida village in early July to the day of the Kingdom of Seto and lived in their homes for four days - J.P.,
What's left here is amazing.
"It is very easy to come to Tapa and to go away, because the city has an excellent location: the railway junction and the crossing of the roads," says Reigo Tamm, an opera-like one from Tapa.
The city is no longer just a military capital, we have a lot of nature, sports and cultural places, and pizza is available at every corner.
Kill is the top-top town!
There is a small island that runs through the city by the White River, where the tapers tend to have an ostrich party.
"This beautiful place does not appear in the train window," does Reigo remember.
If you're not afraid of cold water, you can swim in that river because the river is full of sources.
I've been swimming there, I can do it!
You can have a picnic on the river and just do romance - you can look at the river flow and think about life in advance and back.
I've been there for a walk with my girlfriends.
The Operisol Oak, apart from everything else, has been on the river bank between the three bridges, practicing his Aryas: "Since this place is near the city, no one may answer if I humble my own stories."
"The mountain of pine has a wonderful view of Tapa, but there are also health trails where you can run, ski in winter and now play discgolf - the golf course is done, the discs can be rented from the fitness centre," Reigo leads.
The old pros, of course, go there with their disks, but I haven't played there yet.
I think it's time to invite my colleague Rasmus Kull to visit Tapa because he's an experienced discgolfer and he has disks.
Maybe he'll lend it to me!
Reigo and Männikägi were inseparable during the childhood of the present operisolist.
At least during ski lessons.
There are many tears left on this mountain, many disappointments, and you will win in my sporting life.
Not to mention broken sledges and skis.
"The whole city is full of construction work right now, all this is becoming unknown," praised Reigo.
Kill an old and tired station building, however, is a very attractive place where summer festivities are played.
I am pleased that, in 2012, the head of R.A.A.A.A.M, Märt Meos, accepted my idea and came to the station to do a summer theater.
Although this year's theatre season "Alexei Karenin" was just over, on August 11, the railway station "Resurrection" is on the way to the old station in the 1980s.
"From 11 to 13 August, the days of Tapa City have awakened home cafes and cultural events, including the National Rally, have taken place," says Reigo, who recommends a visit to the city of 91 in these days.
In the tiny yellow cabin on May 1, the boulevard has a museum since 1994.
"The house is small, but the exhibits are great and the information is huge," praised Reigo to a place full of Tapa City history, most of which is focused on railway and military.
Reigo grins that if he goes through all the recommended places on Tapa, his stomach will be empty, but luckily the small town will be full of cafes.
"We have such great places to eat, and sometimes when we sit in cafés, you get the feeling that you're abroad," he describes.
The educated and young soldiers who come to Tapa spend a lot of time in pubs and cafés, which is why sitting there makes you feel like you are in Estonia and your home town, but there is such an international society all around.
I think it would be very exciting to hear stories from the French or the Americans.
Soldiers, yes, we've got a lot going!
In Greece, two Bulgarian people were arrested for illegal camping.
The TV channel bTV quoted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who reported that two Bulgarian people were taken into custody in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of August 1, the police arrested a group of illegally camped people on the Sithonia peninsula, including two Bulgarian people.
They were released the same day, but there's an investigation now.
The State Department told bTV that the Bulgarian were later released.
The Greek authorities have increased the restrictions on free camping and are already imposing severe fines on all those who are caught on holiday in a place that is not intended for that purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
The wolves who teach the puppies are going to break the sheep.
The farmers of Hiiumaa, after a year's break, must give the wolves "teaching material" from their flock again - apparently, the wolves who taught puppies have already broken a number of sheep.
This year, wolves in Hiiu County have broken sheep three times, 23 sheep in total, and injured eight, writes Hiiu Leht.
Last year, the number was only three, 124 a year earlier.
There is also evidence from the Environmental Agency that wolf nests were not born last year in Hiiumaa and information from the Hiiumaa Hunting Council that two wolf nests have been fixed on the island this year.
On the night of Monday, the wolves broke 15 sheep in Kabuna village in Emmaste parish and injured the 18 surviving sheep half.
Early on Wednesday morning, wolves broke one sheep in the pasture of the village of Rehelena and badly injured another who had to be killed.
Rules for the handling of GM crops must be clear
The Ministry of Rural Affairs sent a draft Act on the release of genetically modified organisms into the environment (GMO VS) and amending the Plant Protection Law.
The amendment to the law renounces the creation of a separate database for both genetically modified (GM) crop locations and operators, for which the plant health register will be used in the future.
In addition, GM crop operator's obligation to have a prior agreement within the prescribed radius with the beekeeping person is amended.
Although GM crops are not currently cultivated in Estonia, we consider it necessary to have clear rules for the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops.
At least until the decision has been taken to declare the Estonian GMO free, "said Sigmar Suu, Head of the Plant Health Department of the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
"At the same time, it must be taken into account that the measures developed must be targeted and proportionate, taking into account the costs and administrative burdens for both the private and the public sector," added Suu.
The draft law repeals the provisions relating to the data collection and training of GM crop locations and operators in the GMO, establishes requirements for GM crop management and start-up of economic activities.
As regards specific beekeeping, the current obligation for GM crop growers to inform beekeepers of the start of GM crop cultivation will be replaced by the obligation to reach an appropriate agreement with beekeepers before the start of growing.
The draft law has been sent to the ministries for coordination.
All interested parties have the opportunity to consult the draft information system and, if they wish, to submit their views to the Ministry of Rural Affairs.
The proposed changes will affect in particular those active in the field of plant production, beekeepers and the Agriculture Authority.
In the European Union, including Estonia, only one GM crop is allowed - maize MON 810.
So far, however, no Estonian farmer has been interested in growing GM crops.
This is due to the fact that there is no maize pest in Estonia, a European stallion for which the maize line MON 810 is resistant.
The varieties of this maize line are also bred in the southern regions and this maize is not suitable for our climate conditions.
In 2015 and 2016, the Ministry of Rural Affairs has commissioned studies to detect possible contamination by GM organisms in seeds of different varieties of suviraps, maize and soya grown in Estonia.
The results of the analysis of the samples taken showed that the seeds did not contain any foreign matter and that the study concluded that the seeds of oilseed rape, maize and soya varieties grown in Estonia do not contain genetically modified organisms.
In turn, it can be concluded that GM crops are not deliberately cultivated in Estonia and that no accidental contamination has occurred.
Jose Mourinho thinks that Manchester United recruited Nemanja Maticu in the form of "genius"
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has recruited a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Maticu after he debut himself against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
A player bought over from Chelsea for 40 million pounds in Dublin in the last pre-season game of Unite before Uefa Super Cup against Real Madrid started a 2-1 victory in the starting line on Tuesday, making an impression on the defensive role, while Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were free to go on attack trips.
But aside from Blues' pre-season Asian tour, Maticul was in dire need of a match and he lasted only 45 minutes. According to Mourinho, this must be improved with certainty before the Premier League season began.
"He needs time, but he has experience, intelligence, brilliant thinking - he has a football mindset," said Mourinho.
"We'll help him get a uniform as soon as possible."
Like Matic, other newly recruited Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started starting at Aviva Stadium, and Mourinho quietly started setting up his own start-up man at the beginning of the season.
The Independent announced this week that Mourinho still wanted to recruit three football players, but he confirmed that the club had already done an 'excellent job' by concluding contracts with three of his four priority choices.
"I am grateful to the club for being able to realise three out of four," he added.
"I'll be happier if they can make four out of four, but they've worked hard for me."
Another son of the swamp received a GSM transmitter on his foot on August 1st and this time in Muhus.
According to Mati Martinson, a bird-watcher living on the finger, the first colt became an attendant in the Finger, and this litter is already flying around, has left the nest and joined the large body of the Mullutu-Great Bay.
This is because the Finger has no fields of grain, written by the Voice of the Islands.
This Tuesday, relatively late to ring the throats, another crane son got attached to the transmitter, on Muhu Island.
According to Martinson, the installation of transmitters is actually an international project carried by Aivar Leito and Ivar Ojaste.
Last year, a crook named Mati's GSM-transmitter was supplied by the Finger Turk.
"His activities are all on the Internet to see: how he went to Spain to winter, when he returned to the German and Polish borders for a long time, and then came to Saaremaa," said Martinson.
The British inventor had a microchip installed in his body to get into the house and the car with a hand sign.
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could simply use his hand to open his front door, get into the office and even start the car.
The 33-year-old Steven Northam had a tiny chip installed between his thumb and forefinger and now offers this service through his company BioTeq also to companies and individuals who want to make their lives easier with technology.
He has joined forces with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant at the Hampshire County Royal Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the installation procedure complies with medical standards.
The technology is similar to the microchip applied to cats and dogs and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
The Northam company will also change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, asking for 300 pounds for one lock.
This married one child's father has now installed the technology both at home and in his car BMW Z4, which will start when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House exhibit cost the taxpayers thousands
According to the military documents published by TIME, the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter last month for an American production event was worth as much as $24,000 to taxpayers in the south yard.
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One during the President's stay on board, was the central attraction of the event that took place in the White House on 17 July to introduce American construction programmes.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials have been overseeing industrial products from all 50 states on their rounds.
A helicopter built in Connecticut was exhibited together with a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a fork lift made in Mississippi.
According to documents from the helicopter squadron Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the White House War Office requested a helicopter presence sub-order with FARGO just 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the south yard for an "unusual" event.
"I wanted you to be aware of this because this is an event of unusually high interest," said the commander of HMX-1 in e-mail the day before the event to his superior, deputy officer in charge of the Navy in the field of aviation.
The message said that the helicopter would arrive at the south yard at 7 p.m. on July 17 at 3 p.m. and remain there until the yard was cleared between 18 p.m. and 21 a.m. on the same night.
It was added that, should the departure from the White House be delayed, a return flight would require a second deck due to working time restrictions.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event and the squadron security team remained close to the aircraft for the duration of its stay on the ground.
It was not possible to find out from the documents given to the Time magazine whether or not the second Eskimage was finally needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government assets for political purposes.
The documents indicate that HMX-1 has examined whether this event could violate this provision.
"We asked if it was breaking Hatch's law, and we were told it wasn't," the commander wrote.
"You don't seem to have a choice," answered the deputy officer in charge.
The White House declared the event "made in America" an official event, and Hatch's law wouldn't have covered it.
But even at official events, there are political undertones.
The president supported the efforts of the health reform which was discussed at the time in the Senate and praised the efforts to keep government regulations in line.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically profitable purposes is not a new phenomenon.
The presidents must use them to travel.
However, the requirement to use them for purely photographic purposes is unusual.
Trump got attention in February when his first campaign event in Melbourne, Florida, rolled a presidential plane, and his Twitter account was crawling with messages about how his predecessor used the presidential plane.
"White House is very pleased with the display" American made, "where products from all 50 states made by American workers made of American materials," said Lindsay Walters, acting spokesman of the White House.
HMX-1 teams often perform test flights around Washington and in the south yard to practice putting down the President of the United States at the White House with a centimeter accuracy.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 held 58 trial landings in the White House yard.
According to the official, the flight to the American-made flight crew was included in the flight's monthly flight standard.
Squadron helicopters flew 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, no other display of this event loaded the taxpayer's wallet.
According to a representative of Sikorsky, the company was not involved in organising the exhibition on the south side of the helicopter.
HMX-1 does not maintain the President's flight budget records and the exact costs of the event are difficult to identify.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence's hourly prices for the financial year 2017, the VH-3D compensation rate is $24,380 per hour of flight.
Squadron documentation indicated the flight length from its main base at the Naval Quantico airport in both directions from Virginia for 30 minutes.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that amount.
"The calculation of taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimated compensation rates is very misleading," said Walters.
"These estimated reimbursement rates shall include staff, maintenance and many other irrecoverable costs to be taken into account for annual appropriations. ';
According to the RAND study of 2015, the compensation rates of the Ministry of Defence do not include personnel costs, but cover fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
A former White House spokesman, Sean Spicer, defended the use of a helicopter at the event at the time.
"The point is to show things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that the state of Sikorsky and Connecticut is very proud that they are contributing to our national security and that there are supposed to be hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose work depends on it.
And I believe that just like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly on.
So, of course, it is right to highlight it. "
It's not clear whether Trump came into contact with a helicopter in the south yard during the tour, but he did sit behind the wheel of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump turned to representatives of Sikorsky, making fun of media publications about company products in his own aircraft park.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of their products."
Grit Šadeiko - through tears came peace and joy
In 2011, MM Daegus hit Šadeiko in the last area, a foot cramp in the 800 m race, and the girl was taken away from the stadium with a stretcher.
Shortly before that, he had received zero at the universal held in China in a jump-off.
The Helsinki EM in 2012 was damaged by an injury to the spear toss, but it received a 23rd seat in a debut-müümpia in London with 6013 points.
Misfortune, however, continued.
After opening day, Moscow MM in 2013 suffered a thumb injury in the distance jump of the Estonian woman who was on the Estonian record schedule.
Two years later, he took his 15th place at the Beijing World Cup and filled the Olympics, but it was a disappointment to the athlete who wanted more.
Shadeiko only passed the heaviest gauntlet last year, when he did not receive the result in a jump-off at Amsterdam's EM.
I'd just like to put together one decent multi-contest once.
Once, "Shadeiko confessed.
The worst was still ahead: a month later his Olympic contest in Rio was interrupted by a thigh injury at the first barrier.
Time to take it off - do you think you could go back to the seven-track?
Is two days of effort still worth all this?
She thought for a long time, but she found peace.
I could think clean.
This experience is relatively difficult to describe, but I've been thinking that last season and Rio Olympics were something that just had to happen.
Luckily, there was time to heal and think clean.
"I knew I wouldn't put the instruments in the bag yet," Shadeiko talks about his self-cleaning.
I was able to turn the slate clean and move on with a new momentum.
According to Coach Anne Mägi, it was very difficult to look at the suffering of the ward, but he realised that, above all, the athlete himself had to find out.
He was so beaten down by everyone.
It was hard to bear.
"But Grit said he wouldn't give up, and he wants to prove to himself what he's worth," says Mountain.
Now there's some kind of peace in him.
He makes it his pleasure.
The competition came back in May, when Šadeiko set 6280 points in the new Estonian record at the Götze multi-competition.
In a high-level competition, he improved his personal top mark by nearly a meter (13.89) and ran in a hurdle near the record.
Then the multi-contestant sensed that it was not a ceiling of ability, but that it was only the first race hunger that was extinguished.
Mägi, who supervised him for years, says that Šadeiko is a master student.
He's a ready athlete, he's good to train.
If something's wrong or wrong, he'll say it now.
He knows his own body and trusts his own sense.
That's what we have to follow.
I cannot tell you exactly what to do and we will follow it.
A new approach has also been found by Šadeiko.
"I am not the kind to make the maximum in practice," he says and says that the most important thing is to get the right feeling, because it also ensures a good result.
The happiness of a close baby makes you happy.
Good emotions have also been given to Šadeiko by the happiness of the loved ones.
Both Maris Mägi and Sister Grete, her former trainee partner, recently became parents and the multicompetitor has received support from new world citizens.
"It's been quite interesting," says Šadeiko.
One alcohol that equals "training" in the brain.
Livestron writes that Dr. Gordon Sheperd is such a big fan of wine that he believes that wine can train the brain better than any other thing in the world.
Sheperd is a neuroscientist at Yale University.
According to him, it is not about alcohol or how it affects our feelings and thoughts, but rather about the 'very active' process of tasting wine.
Sniffing glass, swirling wine, enjoying it and sensing aftertaste, we make our brains work to create a taste for wine.
According to Sheperdi, there is no actual taste in the being of the cattle, but rather the way in which the wine stimulates the brain.
He's going to compare the way the brain "sees" colors.
"Taste is not in wine, taste creates wine taster," says Sheperd.
Things that still affect the taste of wine are, for example, our age, gender and even the amount of saliva that man produces.
Of course, Sheperd exhorts that wine is not to get drunk.
"There must be more in action," he says.
If you take too big a sip, the system will be oversaturated.
Too much wine can harm the brain rather than gain - according to a 2004 study, people who drink more than three glasses of wine, loss of memory, loss of balance and reduced mental capacity risk.
10% of employees in the Estonian ICT sector are paid less than their colleagues
Data from the personnel search company Fontes reveal that 10% of Estonian ICT employees are paid less than their colleagues.
The ten percent pay gap is between men and women, written by the portal Genius.
The Fontese ICT sector wage survey involved 59 IT and telecommunications companies.
The total number of posts was 8 577.
63% of posts were occupied by men.
"While only three companies stated that the pay gap was in favour of men and that the rest of the companies considered that there was no pay gap, compared to each other, men's basic monthly salary is on average 10% higher than women's and men's total annual salary on average 8% higher than women's," said Fontese analyst Ilmar North.
"Narcos" third season commercial clip: now that Pablo Escobar has gone, the Cali cartel will be at the center of the Netflix hit series.
Despite the fact that Pablo Escobar's killer was exposed in the second season of Narcos, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have been confirmed by the streaming service, and the first of them has already made a commercial clip that teases the show with new villains.
In the third season, the DEA is paying attention to the world's richest drug trade organization, the Cali cartel.
They operate under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, such as the Fortune 500 company, simply with more bribes to the government and more violent acts.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the cartel leader, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) runs its brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) runs links with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) operates in New York.
In the newly released billboard, Pedro Pascal sees Javier Penana returning, a character who recruits American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of "Narcos" is on September 1st.
According to the UN, the Afghan democracy depends on the role of women in politics.
The UN Head of Mission for Afghanistan said on Wednesday that elections can only represent the people if all members of society, including women, play a role in them.
Nicholas Haysom, Head of United Nations Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women stand for local council elections, three women stand for Vice-President, and more than 30% of recently registered voters are women.
"It is not possible to overstate the role of women," he said in his statement on Wednesday.
Elections can truly represent and be credible only if women participate fully and are involved in all stages of the electoral process.
The local council elections and presidential elections in Afghanistan will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban, for its part, has threatened an election process that coincides with the transition period during which the role of international military operations becomes advisory.
This year's elections mark the first time that power is handed over peacefully from one democratically elected government to the next.
According to Haysom, the strong role of women increases the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The joy of sharing makes everything cooler for both the big and the small.
The common time is always too little, but the exercise with the kids gives a good opportunity to combine the meeting, game, proximity and load.
And what a convenient solution - wherever you cruise in the summer, live chantas are always with you and you can't wait to remember with your tiny little voice: "Let's work out!"
Start warming - it's good to have a regular hawk game or run along the beach strip.
The hunk is the foundation of staying in the form of feet and buttocks - who would want to take the form of sand cake washed out of the waves during the summer?
It's wonderful to use children instead of a lever!
First of all, it is safe and comfortable, the weight is gradually increasing at the same rate as the trainer's strength.
The advanced ones can do crows with pretty big kids.
A child trains balance, reads repetitions, and has fun at the opportunity to be high and important.
Bigger kids can do their own crows at the same time.
The range of movement is determined by touching the earth and stretching your hands up.
Keep your fingers straight, ask the minivan to hold on properly.
A child can read repetitions and feel like a trainer.
Plank is extremely useful, but a child for a hopelessly boring exercise.
But it's easy to make things more fun!
Game-plank: Take a long column of plank that you can slip through in turns.
Actually, it's harder than usual, but it's a lot more fun to make when you can give a friend a hand in the meantime.
To add the load, you can stick to the plank, a tiny one on your back, and walk around in that position.
An extra weight can be put on the small child's hips, but this exercise offers fun for all children.
While the crabs are dripping on the sand, the trichens, the buttocks and the abs get a load like a blunt one.
The child descends on his feet in such a way that his weight is distributed equally forward and rearward.
You can hold hands for safety.
Curve your legs and stretch straight up.
A kid can fly, have fun, work out his balance and be a burden.
The life of a little coach is extreme when he gets a little kiss every time he comes up.
An extra load is given by stretching your legs forward.
Make sure your back stays in neutral.
The kids themselves have a lot more fun to do with a couple and a clap.
A squat with a pulse and a handiwork.
Watch the child's safety, knee position, and keep your back in neutral.
All children's favorite and great fun!
Parents at the same time have a truly effective whole body workout.
The tools of sport were Ott (10), Spark (8), Happy (4).
A trip from the Philippines to the heart of fashion fans to the wider world
The straw-braided bags are a summer classic, which has become a separate hit product in recent years, which one of the right summer enthusiasts has to hang on to his hand and which, despite its modest origins, has been able to weld a price label suitable for the hit.
An straw-braided bag is probably one of those things that has existed in every life and that have not been very emotional about having.
It just exists, and if it doesn't, there's nothing broken.
But now the straw bags are about to make a real victory, and fashion fans have switched their fancy designer bags for the summer months instead of simple straw-brained bags.
It is not only a beach bag, but it is as popular today as a street bag, and more courageous women even walk into the office with it.
However, it is worth making clear to the boss whether a summer look like this is still sitting or whether it is worth pushing the wet and notebook to a slightly more formal sumadan.
Variety has turned straw bags into women's true summer love.
For example, by reading foreign fashion blogs, the first thing that stands out is that fashion gourmans are the first thing to get on holiday to the local market and buy themselves a leash bag that is then faithful to the rest period and that goes with the beach, the market and also hanging out with friends on the town.
Some bloggers are so generous they buy more bags on the market and sell or hand them over to their loyal readers.
It is worth noting, however, that the demand for bags is so high among readers that, in the real world, women (and men!) would probably go hand in hand with each other to become the happy owner of some bags.
In some ways, this madness is also understandable, because it is rare to buy some of the things that have risen into a hit-and-run state in the fashion world for just a few tens of euros.
It is true that clever merchants have also discovered a simple way of making money here, and so the finer luxury brands also sell straw bags for a few hundred and a thousand euros.
Probably just so the richer customers don't have to feel like simple mortals promencing around with some cheap bags.
For example, it is possible to buy a handbag with over €1 000 in Dolce & Gabbana.
However, Chanel's shoulder bag can be interpreted in a round of €6,000.
Unlike most mosquitoes, straw bags do not come from any of the big fashions, but their story started much further away.
Indeed, it is said that the straw bags originate far from the Philippines, from which they have been transported into the vast world.
Wearing a bag of straw is above all an exhibitor, and the locals don't see it going around with them very often.
It is claimed that straw weaving technology dates back to the 14th century and is rather rainy with ordinary basket weaving.
However, since the shoulder bag does not have to be braided as hard as the basket, it is possible to embed patterns and other materials into them, which make the bag more personalized and, by this point, more attractive.
For example, recently there have been particularly trendy bags with coloured ribbons or leather straps embedded in them.
The letter of thanks can be sent first and foremost to actress Jane Birkin, the biggest braided straw bag fan of whom had never been seen before.
In fact, he matched his shoulder bag with all kinds of clothing kits, and he didn't even think it was much to go to the Cannes Film Festival.
However, it does not play a smaller role in the popularity of bags today, either, that care for them is a cocksucker and, unlike all other Sumadans, they do not need to be cared for by special means, but water and wet towels also do the job.
As always in the case of trend robberies, apart from the classic appearance, brands have come out with all kinds of interpretations.
For example, you can buy yourself a straw-braided radicle or a tiny shoulder bag if you wish.
At the same time, it is worth remembering that the classic straw bag never goes out of fashion, but it does go out of style.
But what's the classic shoulder bag like?
For centuries, it has been considered classic to have such a straw-braided bag, which resembles a basket of its style, is open on top and short, as well as straw-brained, handles.

A home with a golden touch in a millionaire oak town
She's building a home. Instead of a funnel, a wooden house has sprung up.
The man who disappeared in Saaremaa three days ago was found.
The treasure left its home in the village of Kärla on Wednesday evening in an unknown direction.

The police thank everyone who helped find the treasure.
GMB is concerned about investments in McVitie's Glasgow plant.
The union expects the leaders of the cookie producer McVitie to confirm long-term production plans at the Glasgow plant.
According to GMB Scotland, the company has been silent on the future of the investment of the Tollcross object.
The factory that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies and other products employs more than 500 people.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said they have invested more than GBP 5 million in the last few years.
More employees were hired and union presidents "are the first to hear" if anything changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter sent to the company's site manager, GMB Scotland addressed McVitie's request to "dissect the concerns that the funding would not be used to modernise production lines."
The GMB's senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot get clarity from the chief manager of the object about Tollcross's business needs and future investment plan is a source of deep concern for our members.
Several generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is largely composed of the local community and people around Glasgow, an essential pillar for ensuring a decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social exclusion.
Therefore, in view of jobs, wages and well-being in the eastern part of Glasgow, and against the background of Brexit, a rise in living costs and a chronic decline in production, McVitie is in dire need of a thriving company. "
The representative of the platform said: "The site manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company is responding directly to him because we value active communication with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, a regular meeting between workers and GMB representatives took place in Tollcross, where a number of problems were discussed openly.
We then discussed with the workers that, like all other companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are reviewing our activities on an ongoing basis - and this applies to all our businesses and objects - to ensure that we are competitive.
He added: "In recent years, we have invested over GBP 5 million in Tollcross, most of which has gone to production lines and to improve operations.
We fully understand the heritage of Tollcross as a production site, and if there is any change in the activity of the site, the workers and trade union representatives will be the first to hear about it. "
Did PSG warn Barcelona three years ago about neymar's approach?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratt.
Paris Saint-Germain does not give up in trying to lure Neymar into his ranks, making an offer of GBP 189 million for his buy-out, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of this record conquest?
This clumsy approach has opened the summer transition window and the Liber1 Club is prepared to break more than twice the current world record of overbuying, which was set last season by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United for GBP 89 million.
Once the transition has been completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and also the highest paid professional athlete in the world who will receive more than GBP 500,000 a week after tax from PSG.
Barcelona is, as you know, angry at both the way in which approach was taken and the way in which Neymar broke free, although a source close to the Catalans board confirms that the club has always taken the best care of the football player since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But did the PSG president warn the world of football about this opportunity three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in concluding a contract with Blaise Matuid in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaif strongly warned all clubs who were thinking about recruiting some of PSG's best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, we will face them and contact those players," said Al-Khelaif.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to make a deal with one of our players, they will have to face the consequences. "
Barcelona seems to have stepped over this line because the Spanish club earlier this summer showed interest in Marco Verratt, the PSG's center-field player.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances and that Barcelona could suffer a setback as a result of this interest by losing one of its precious assets in the form of Neymar.
Prime Minister: Ireland wants to build bridges after Brexit, not borders.
"Brexit is threatening to hit the wedge between Northern Ireland and Ireland, Great Britain and Ireland," said Varadkar on his first visit to Northern Ireland after taking office in June.
"I can't imagine who would benefit from it," he added.
Cross-border infrastructure projects made the current free movement of people and goods possible, said Varadkar.
"This is our vision for the future: building bridges, not borders," he stressed.
According to Varadkar, he would prefer Britain to remain a part of the European Union, and since it is not, he would remain a part of the European common market.
This would maintain the current free trade between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom.
Another way to make Britain's exit smoother was to establish a customs union between the European Union and the United Kingdom, explained by the Irish Prime Minister.
Noting that such an agreement existed with Turkey, Varadkar said: 'Surely we could have such an agreement with Britain'.
An alternative to this would be a return to customs points that would declare historical divisions and political failure.
"Barrier to trade, prosperity and peace," said the Irish Prime Minister.
He called Brexit 'the challenge of our generation' and warned that its outcome could affect every aspect of Northern Ireland's daily life.
The Irish Prime Minister met the leaders of the main parties in Northern Ireland when he visited Belfast.
Märt Avandi passed his first half-long triathlon: Ironman can pass anyone.
Today, the biggest triathlon festival in the Baltic States was held in the winter capital of Otepää, when about a thousand triatelets from over thirty countries took place in the semi-long Ironman competition.
The distance of 70,3 miles consisted of 1,9 km of swimming, 90 km of cycling and 21,1 km of cycling.
Among other things, Märt Avandi ended his life victorious in the first triathlon.
"I thought it would be difficult, and it was difficult in the end," said Avandi at the finish.
Despite the complexity, Avandi recognised that in fact the triathlon is capable of almost anyone.
'It is not the distance that kills, but the pace that kills, 'he said, suggesting that at an affordable pace, almost everyone reaches the finish line.
Except for Ott Sepp: "Oti's physique is fine, but unfortunately he can't swim."
Avandi had been working hard since February.
At first, four or five hours a week, then ten hours a week.
At 5: 34: 12 he reached his 270th place in the general accounts.
Although Avandi lost to both Raio Pirioja (time 04: 59: 53) and Jürgen Lig (time 05: 06: 37), he won other so-called "prominent class" contestants.
Tanel Padar, who was a "good example" last year, lost to Avandi in seven minutes (period 05: 41: 54), journalist Sten Teppen in 16 minutes (period 05: 50: 23), Kalev Kruus and Raivo E. Tamm in about an hour (times 06: 31: 53 and 06: 45: 18, respectively).
The men of the Otepää stage of the Ironman series were crowned by German Johannes Moldan at 3: 58: 27, the best of the Estonians was Ivo Great at 4: 14: 09.
Among women, Helle Frederiksen triumphed with the time of 4: 24: 01, and Maria Jänes of Estonians, who lost to Frederiksen in almost half an hour and received the time of 4: 58: 58.
The avandi passed a 1,9 km swim distance in 42 minutes and 14 seconds.
He came out of the water in his 410th position.
