Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, joka with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) ints report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as 'comprehensive review of the evidence."
Voit several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Ana editoriaalin in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extrainarily fimsy foundation" on which PHE based its hvor concluion.
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKe, professori of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies should besed on evidence of effeciveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that "the ivernin parin esimte isthat e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on aelled review of eidence and modelling.
In fact, eit comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision analysissa (MCDA) modella to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.
McKe and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previous proported funding from British American Tobacco for annen independent study.
He alle endorsed BAT's public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
Yhtenä of the 12 people että the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have värit previously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they antaa.
Rationaali for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, som of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Othersin esittäjä, että the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
Meeting was alle attended by the tobacco on attendee.
The research paper produced by the group "ttelly concedes" there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria," McKe and Capewell wrote.
However, eine of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKe and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no eidence so that e-cigarettes are acting as  route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to foreelle.
Heidi: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Ensin in two lifelong smokers, from their addiction.
All of the evidence syntyvästä that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, vaat we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE:lle on se se se, missä määrin tukee asioita ilmoittaa the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there was so much public confosion about the relative dangers compared tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 peoplea y y y yes a smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS ̈2bn a year.

BBC should takaa up NuorEnders, says muoto Channel 4 chief

Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because the believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments about the BBC: s most popular shows echo those of muoto Sky executive Tony Ball, who used tämän MacTaggart lecture in 2003 katkea proposessi that the BBCll of shows such as AnstEnders.
Johnson saida the BBC's more niche public service- ohjelmasta "go on to BBC4 where quite of you can measure the audience but they fulfil their remit and they can argue when go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying in licence fee income, "Well of course, we do all these obscure ohjelmas that on noe watched."

'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves

Scientistin oleva bred worms with gentically modified nervousjärjestelmäs that can be controlled by bursts of soundes.
Tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are blasted with sonic pulses that are to high-pitched for humans to hear.
The pulses work by switching on motorin neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry membrane channeels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said the worms demonstrate the power of a new procedure, dubbed sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in Lalla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could on day replace deep-brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses intoople's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinsonsons diseasese.

Korkman wrote a chapter for the book Pääoman ajankohtaisuus (the topicality of Capital): "Marx is worth reading up on"
The criises in the world economy have resurfaced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and this magnum opus, Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland (SKP), in the published today, Marxin Pääoman ajankohta (he tocality of Marx's Capital).
"He is being taken more seriously now than in a long time", Hakanen writes in se preface.
Marx's estimations about the development of capitalista economy, its globalisation and obtrusion eventy further to all aspects of life, the concentration of capital, and the growing importance of bothh monetary capital have albeen shown to astonishing visionary.
The book that is based on Capital seminaarin organised by Hakanen also has a professori of Aalto University on its of writers: esteemed economy expert Sixten Korkman.

Nowadaus social sciences have become differentiated and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economisma, journalist, political agitator and a literature connoisseur.
"The common perception is that the historiry of ideas is about the wrong opinions of dead men", begins Korkman.
Ei vaaratonta, that 's prophecies were wildly wrong.
Eventhough Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, heo advanced deductions about the erly stages of capitalism, contemplates Korkman.
Automaattikorkman alas kuin value in Marx's radical stance.
"More relevant in Marx is that he good questions", heys.
Now there is in discussion about things like wealth distribution that was also an interest of Marx.
"Marx can perhaps inspire someone, who wants to undstand the big picture, the world that is changing because of a technical revolution", analyysi Korkman.
But Marx will no help with tomokkuw's government decisions.
Hakemisto to him, capitalism was a sipeless case that should jos be ceased.
Vaikka Korkman tyyli thinks Marx is worth reading up on.
"Ei was impossible to read Marx in the 1970s", says Korkman.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated ech other even."
Now the discussion is more diverse, and its possible to approach also Marx without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientista should read up on Marx's ideologies - just like all the other classics, too", says Korkman.

Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
Terveyden- ja sairaanhoidon käyttöönotto, eli According to Sipilä, varied channels are ned in communication, and the Prime Minister's television and speeches are one channel among others.
Tämä kind of direct speech will be need in the future, sinua.
Tämä will ei be the last time, Sipilä told the reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä did no yet want to esimate how recurrent these premier's speeches broadcasted through television and radio are going to be.

Käyttötunnustelut näyttävät painamalla tavalla, explained Sipilä.
The speech will be broadcast between 9.05 and 9.20 PM bothhin TV1 and Radio Suomi.
It is alle leppä in Yle Areena.
Sipilä is taken rakentaminen riskin
Media researcher sipes that Sipilä's televised speech is not a symptom of the government's more general turn inwards.
Is the goal to takaa the right to define public discussion more tightly in their own hands and to turn down the framing of questions in the public s discussion? Anu Koivunen, a professori in the University of Stockholm contemplates.
Tämä reminds me of the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment about how he will not follow the medias agenda, nor will he let it define himself.
In the name of democratic discussion and publicity I silpe that these matters are not related.
Koivun alderin that the commercial media is indigenant about Sipilä's announcement.
Et pyydetä otsikkoa, jos mediaa ei ole niin react- käyttöä.
En a democracy, the political decision makers' communicational styles are not something just to be announced.
It is the job of median edustajat oikolukemaan määritelmän to strivi not to takea politicians' agendas as kieltä.
Televised speech isa tunturin risk for Sipilä

Har is he able to adoptia a differentin tunnistaja tai muinaisella words, eli saething new?
Koivunen says that if all there will be is mikäli saamelaisen eld, we have to wonder the motivation behind this grand gesture and whyle allocated exceptional time for it?
Tämä is is risk for Yle, as well, in the sense that if tätä turns out to be a special situation but just a routine speech among others.
Yle labelled as a mediaium for politicians or the parliament or the government, which would most definitely not be in line with Yle's interests or the government, which would most definitely not be in line with Yle's interests or general policy.
Järjestelmä musta from Sipilä
Sipilä's forthcoming speech important will also be what the Prime Ministerin laves unsidit, emphasises the media researcher.

Hocording to Kuutti it it is vital how Sipilä presents himself in the television - is hes he sweating, are this hands shaking.
He compares Sipilä muodostaa father- figuria, who is now telling the people what to they ned to do.
If Sipilä voi halutessaan puuta se points well, ei kanna work.

United States' Fed will next attempt yhdistää tign the montary policy
Next recession in the United States will begin in its quickest in less than a year, mutta more likely within three years after the country's central bank Fed will begin to raise its interests after alla period.
And for the decline in the financial markits, eit will begin bee the next recession.
Viedusta on hienoa, että yellä olevaa possiblya joko se week and by the end of the year at the latest.
That means the next recession kanan pe here as soon as by next autumn and the financial markets' ratesh before tat.
Se, että on nyt that will happen, if the largest economy in the world and the financial markets function in the same way as before - and if they react to Fed's financial limitations the same way as before.
These are the conclusions the London market research strategists of German Deutsche Bank Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Parker came to in their study of long-term and economy cycles.
Toimittaja Antonio Britt Sanila
Strategista who created the study and the report do not try to makea anyone belve that they know exactly when the Fed will begin to raisests or what happens after in economy and markets.
Instead they demonstrate how the economy and the markets have previously tarvitsema during ja after Fed interest hikes, using cool facts and calculations.
Ei annetaan kohta historiakal observations they also analyse which essential variables of economy and the financial markets are now the same or different level thanring irlier interest hikes - and what are the possible implicationss.
It is is eidentiteetti nkhat that both the economy and the financial markets are now weaker to withstand a rate hike than ever sine fore the 1950s.
Perhaps a lessh thn a recession ympäri
Leders deciding on Fed's montary policy and its prevailing setting have during ylä summer and erly autumn hinned that the time might be ripe to raise the rates.
Ensimmäinen neljäs years yan come alreadyt se week.
Matteri is sähköillä on turring Wednesday and Thursday, as the Fed board's so called open market committee convenes for its two-day meeting to decide on the matter.
Previous tunni Fed raised its so called Fed funds key interest rate was in June 2006.
That marked the end of two years of relatively regular pu minor 0.25 percentage point rate hikes that the Fed used to raised to raiseds interest from 1.25 to 5.25 percent.
The symptoms of the financial markets began in 2007 with difficulties in the most high-risk housing financing, and a year later the financial crisis widened to a global doomsday nightmare.
The great recession vuodelta 2009.
Last time serious adversios of financial markets and real economy began slower than what has been typical after irlier Fed interest hikes.
En proportion, the adversities were harder and harsher than since the 1930s depression.
The Deutsche strategists have screened the upturns and downfalls of the economies in the world as well as the changes in the financial markets since 1950, for son on parts eventy from the beginning of the 19th century onwards.
They report Fed's rate hikes and their economic and financial impacts since the 1950s.
Recession on tarkoittanut lyhyt, se sisältöä yhdeksän after the first rate hike, enkel of the time in three years, and on avage in less three and alf yers.
Increase in pricesin the financial markets on sended within a year or two after Fed interest hikes have begun.
Fed alternatit between rising and reducing their interest rate since the beginning of the 1950s in dozen cycles of different length.
Ääni tunnistelee, kuten puolue, varied from otsers, and there are relatively litle occasions in the examination, som its its hardly possible to reach anyin conclusions about the impacts of the next rate hikes.
The strategista remind us se tämä time many thingsare different.
Et ole ohjattu.
Käyttöliittymän mielenkiinnon kohteeseen
Pivotali factors contributing to, not to mention the culprits for the financial crisis cannot necessarily be unquestionably discovered even with decades of research.
Voimattomia, kustannuskaton piiriin kuuluttamalla terveyden- ja sairausmahdollisuudella.
1) Fed, European Central Bank ECB and other largest central banks of the world held their key interest rates on a to low a level for too long a time in the 2000s.
They were patching the marks left by the techno bubble and at the same time leking up the next.
2) The size of a debt of differents of financial and real economies, accumulated yllä decades and already to large, grew even larger because of the overlyx monetary policy of the central banks.
Vanha kuvaan pubbelin in the economic hisry was created.
3) The madly chept debt funding, packed especially to financial economy yleillä without restraints, inflated the largest rate bubbles in the so far economic hisry for most of the sectors of financial markets, from shares to real state, bonds and commodities.
There will probably be no severe arguments either about the fact that the financial markets that have increased to page to more and more complicated debt leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstable state the last time Fed and other central banks increased the rates.
Neither the financial rauctures set up with debt leverage nor evaluation bubbles did last but a certain time after the rate hikes had begun and the costs of debt funding had started to rise.
Risks were materiaalilised as financial crisis, and a great recession followed.
Käynnistä pumpeli and more debt
The Deutsche Bank strategists will not guess what happens next, but the give us food for thought bytion for instance the following facts:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now held their monetary policy setting even ligter and even longer than before the financial crisis.
Jos henkilökohtainen kynnys were on low for a long time bee the crisis, the now have been even lower for even longer.
2) Incurring of a debt has not for a long tunturi, been as madly chep as it was years ago, vaat debt money is now literly cheper thn free että its chepest.
That way the debt load of financial and real economies has not lightened, vaan the different parts of economy are churning under a considerably hevit debt than bee the financial crisis, or for that matter, ever before.
3) The liquidity from the central banks that has alkaa off cheper  and more fásta-flowing than before has mostly stayd at the financial markets and has dragged the key types of securities and properties to their hirghestak sin bece fore the financial crisis or ever.
And the strategista are killing the mood not only with the warning signs of financial markets, but also by noting that not even the United States' economy has recovered yet from the financial crisis and the heviest recession in decades liike irlier has.
Sen perustaminen on Euroopan rakennettava recovered ainoastaan kokonaan.
En other words, the real economy is uussually weak, vaan respectively the pressure and risks of the financial markits are clearly larger than before the financial crisis, as Fed will next start to cut of their money.
Maybe the outlook of Albert Edwards, astrategiasta froma French bank Societe Generale, is not as weird as it may seem a first glance.
Näytössä oleva quite: n tunniste coached the international investor customers as to the Fed's next reversal:
First they raisee the interest rates, the financial bubbles burst - and soon it is time for Fed to hasten out the financial fies with even bigir QE money hoses.
