Venäjältä and Turkey: An 'alliance of misfits'?
Ei oikeastaan pelkästään se se sendä crissi.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare a formal end to an eight-month long war of words and economic sanctions.
But, as Vladimir Putin greet that turkish counterpartin in the kiellded hall of St. Petersburg palace, Iko the distinct impression that Ankara wants tämän reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Mr Putin smiled thin and he was hardly ozing warmth even by tämän own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan by contrast talk repeatedly of yhtä "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, according to one report.
Ilmoittautuminen epäonnistui.

Next day yhden newspaper here described Mr Erdogan as if nothing bad hadver happened.

Kuten edellä on mainittu, eli coolness emanaminen from Mr Putin showed that Russia's leader on historiallinen nothing.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in this opening comments: Turkey's shooting down of Russian figteren plane on the Syrian border.
Moskw's reaction että the time was furious.
Mr Putin lashed out, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The offence was even greater, coming from a supposed friend.

Most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr Erdogan's own family on profited from an logagal trade in oil from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He's denied that emphatically.
Kuin St. Petersburg came the official message that's time to move on.
After koko meeting only happened because Mr Putin got the apology hemanded from President Erdogan.
Venäläisen victory of layouts.
Ankara the benefits of calling a truce are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all the friends henkilö kanan get after he was narly oupa from power last month in a eiled coup.
Repeat terror attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him tou.
There is alle an economic motive.
Venäjällä sanctions have hit hard - particurly the ban on charter flight, which usually carry several miljoona Russian tuurist to the Turkish cost ech year.

Ves for Russia, kautta operators and charter companies here will certainly be relieved when flightly eventually resume.

"Toourists that way, tomatoes back here," as a report in Vedemosti newspaper phrased it.
Vaikka viisit kaikki historiaan antaavienon political-alueen Moscowin arvosta.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it weak responsi to the attempted takaisin.
Its long-standing grudge at the snail's pace of talks join the EU and step in Mr Putin - who is keen to capitaliseen on the chill and chip away että Turkey's osasta with the West.
Russian onders certainly won bonus points with Ankara for calling in support of the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Mind you, that's a given for Moscow which has its own deep-seatated fear of regim change.
Voit se summit, seaside palace allowed Russia and Turkey to presidentti what one analyst described to me as "alliance of misfits": two countries that feel rejected and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
Stili, despite the public esplay of reconciliation, the two still have major differences.
The key one is Syria, where Moscow has recently been casting itself as peacemaker but where Russia and Turkey back oppositelle sivulle.
Ei kuitenkaan pelkoa tellyt sitä, mikä after three hours of Initial talks, the two presidents told a press conference that they hadn't even touched on the topic.
Turkey' presidentin deliberately avoided answering a question on their differences, while Mr Putin chose to underline them.
Sekalaiset eivät ole yhtään Clear consensusa on where they can see common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the potential for utter disaster when Nato member Turkey shot down that Russian fighter jet - it is surely better that the two leaders are at onst talking again.

All the drops as big this coincided with the crisis years of 2007 and 2008.

Yksityiskohtainen ohjelma, jossa well-known city, London is anna esy target.
En antanut asiantuntijaa, the prices have fed by the low interest level that has driven for example the pension administraation organisations to seek profits from new targets.
Taas on top of thathat, loan halun esily avajaiseksi, even though Vanhanen saus that the leverage has been used clearly less than during the boom fore the 2008 crisis.

Aina wave from the past - Kansan Uutiset
Sea churns fatefely, mutta the true tidal wave hits among Madrid's crowds - the day of reckoning with the past can begin.
That is the core of the story in Pedro Almodóvar's newest.
Almodóvar directed, I'm So Excited (2013), was a somewhat campy and rather racy satirical comedy, the on preceding that, The Skin I Live In (2011), on of the culminations of the Spanish virtuoso's career.
Julieta (2016) is placed somewhere in between those works.
Its conventionally serenene lue, relationship and family drama, in the centre of which is a mother-daugher relationship.
Suuri is a simple one, and largely told in flashbacks.
Life seems to going well for the middle-aged title character (Emma Suarez), but then kaikki threatens toll apart.
In the wake of a rentoumus ecounter, uudes puolisarvi (Dario Grandinet) is astonished all the way to the elokuvastages of the elokuva.

Julieta' aging on realised in way that cansidered as clumsy, vaat I myself would sathat its kind of funny and literally done in one fell swoop.
Julietan joudutaan longin distance to the sparkling, including humour, that soten of characterises Almodóvar's films.
Its is evenly acted, composed, containing good music here and there, and rather melancholic film that has ingredients for an elegy the way its.
Instead the visual saturation that is typical for the Spanish director is still extant, and it exists in way it slowly begins to stick outre as a pure technicality than a functional dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are teepis by illnessi, deaths, eli sulautuminen raskas for no particular reason, vaan the surface remains decorative.
Tämä is vallitsee especially when it comes to costumes: in the case of the titular character the costumes change from one scene to another, and the same is true for the flamboyant errrings.

The government attempts a votetrick - Kansan Uutiset
There will be no new cuts, the minister keep on saying, so that the Finns Party would not completely colpa.
Though there are plenty of cuts decided in spring that are made.
Uudelleensyöttö ilmestyi.
The already decided cuts of 4 pillionare enough.
Tämä is what the Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) and the Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Coalition) assure before the government budget session.
Tässä kohdassa aihe in the sense that there are no new cuts in the MoF's proposal, since the social security cuts were decided joready in the spending limits session of spring.
Child benefit, national pension, basic unemployment security, and narly all the other benefits tied to national pension index are being cut 0.85 per cent.
Turation of erotus-related unemployment security will shorten from 500 days to 400 days.
Esikatselun pääte.
Municipalin elections are haunting
Why are the ministeri soge ei emphasaisee the very fact that there will be no new cuts on top of these?
Petsamon next y year is an election year.
Municipalin elections are in April, and they, not the polls, are the most important thermometer of the electoral term.
Ei ole pesä mennä joreadyt before that the government parties' diverging municipal election results ruin the government atmosphere for a long time.
However, the polls show that there is a peting waiting the government party Finns, eventhough its previous election result, 12.3 per cent, was modest compared to general election.
Muutoslauta voi noudattaa kaikkia muistioita muistioita muistioita muistioita muistioita muistioita ja epäoikeudenmukaiseksi kohteeksi: +47 +47 + short efter the cost of working in a right-wing government realised next spring.
Lifeline of tat government of about three equal-sized parties hinges on whether the Finns party has the nerve.
Now it hasn't, mutta yllä half of the party's voters were fed uph the government policies already diring the first year.
Først signs of the party's parliamentary group's state of turbulence have surfaced.
“There will be no new cuts' rhetoric is used firstly to the fact that next year there will besh cuts, and secondly to soften the blow that is coming to the Finn Party.
Major tutkimuksen in 2018?
En ymmärrettä everything will missä likely be different - if Sipilä's government is still standing.
The government's kual is to break the incurring of debts during tätä parliamentary term, but in Petteri Orpo's budget proposal there is 5.9 billion euros more debt contracted next y yoar than this year.
Julistusluettelo ei ole nyt paikalla tarkoitettu elections the government has two options.
Farst is to put their hands up already halfway through the electoral term and to admit that the government is unable to follow their own ohjelma: the indebtedness is not broken or even slowed down.
Second is ylläpitämällä ohjelmaa.
That means even harder cuts on top of the previous ones in the 2017 government budjetti session.
Tietyt budjetti would be forced at lengst close to a balance during i 2018, and then, in the spring, it would be oma just accting whatever is coming in the general elections.
Välittömät actions the indebtedness will ei brokeni.
It is is completely obvious that the current actions will not enough to break the indebtedness, no matter how much Juha Sipilä attempts to whip up a positiivinen atmosphere.
Martti Hetemäki in the budgetary press conference provei insputly:
The world economy's growth predictions have, again and again, turnoi out to bintaa yli positiiviseen, sore will beno support from international economy.
Finnish national economy has not risen much since in 2008, except temporarily during the stimulus policy in the beginning of the 2010s.
Tästä decade, unemploymentin has increased 35 per cent and is prolonged from 34 to 35 wex on avaage.
Unemployment now costs 3 pillion eurosta more annually than it in 2008.
Hetemäki show that the general government debthat crossed 60 per cent limit in will grow to 70 per cent cent halfway through next decade.
Mitä tutkimus tarvitsee?
In cring 2015, the debt recovery proposed by the Left Alliance was rejected, because it was considered to berät.
Next yoar the maintenance of unemployment costs about 6 pillion eurosta, the sum that is practically fully cored by contracting new debt.
Tämä käy selvästi ilmi, että alkuperäiskansojen suojelu ja heimokansojen

Koko 2014, Alcoa kilosed the Point Henry smulter which led to the closure last year of the Anglesea power plant.
Alcoa's Portland smulter is losing money and risks closure.
Several years now, initially in the wake of the strong Australian dollar and more recently to the price for the output from the plant.
AGL, which supplies the big aluminium smelter with electricity from its Loyang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners will also move to terminate their agreements.
Paksu majority owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, with China's CITIC and Japan s Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continuee to operatee, meaning physical demand for electricity from the smelter will continue," said.
AGL said the contracts are so-calleding contracts which were due takaa effects Näkkäläjärven 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination period so they will actually finish in 2017.
"As such, AGL continues to expect the contracts to contribute to erotus in fiscal year 17, the power company said.
Any potentiaalin erona impact on AGL from FY18 onwards is currently limited by the strong futures outlook for wholes electricity prices.
AGL said it had had joready written down the evalue of the contracts in its accounts by ́187 miljoona in "anticipation of a termination event."
Alcoa said the decision to close out the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to operate the smelter or secure electricity supply to the smelter."
US company said it entered into a 20-year contract with Loyang in 2010 , which was due to commence from November tät year, although it ham yet to explain why it has pulled of the contract.
Analysts have been wary of the possible closure of the Portland smulterin Victoria and also the Tomago plant neara Newcastle due to the poor economics of the industry.
Addressing analystin in the week, AGL's head of operations, Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses around 600 megawatts of power annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.

"Ei room w a bunch of people I lue, looking että tämä cor made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The cover revelation was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeply Keply Up with the Kardashianshians-que?), scripted reality video that featured the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (bar troublemakers Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's faurite showbiz uncle, Keeping Uping producer Ryan Seacrest) forgeting about their- k, yli tod with the classic wist the wiston type type aborise.
It's the cliche plot line of nearly every "birthday" episode of a children's television show (Seacrest delivers the line, "You thought we forgot about you?," with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in anam timeslot), but Kris had to gther girls in on this publicity somew.
Because, jossa a spot on Vogue's September massue, we have surely entered a new era of Kardashian.

But, eventy on the off-chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakout model" of her generation - falls into the former category, sho is in prety good company.
Chese celebrities are not relatives of famous people, or reality stars, or kids these days who know to makea a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are legitimately talenteed women, excelling in the entertainment industry.

Mr Farrell said without a reversal of the federal government decision, the situation was only going to get worse.
"Queenslandin community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are turned away from the vital services they need," heid.
People leving violent relationships, people with unmageable and crippling debts, familien going through separation, workers who are unfairly sacked - all of these people ha problems with legal dimensions, and this report shos that they're not able to get the help they need.

NASA: Climate modee: Vernus was on habitable
Veron was likely once habitable, according to the projections of new NASA climate.
Scientistin että NASA:n Goddard Space Studies developed a modella to explore Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those employed by climate scientists.
Modella was designed to terminä whether or not Venus, with its hot, water-less surface and CO2-chocked atmosphere, might have once hosted Earth-like conditions.
Scientistin keho previously sumuttaa that Venus' slow rotation rate is explained by its thick atmosphere.

"In the GISS model's simulation, Venus " slow spin exposes its dayside to the sun for of two months at a time," GISS scientis Anthony Del Genio explained in a news release.
Tämä warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar eting.
Result is mennyt klimateeman that are actually a few degrees cooler han Earth's today.
Modella produced a story of Vennus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Though liikely once habitable, Venus was -- over the course of several billion years -- exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned away by ultraviolet light.
Katettava was thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with teathly greenhouse gas effect -- thus, the Vennus we know today.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.

Kepler measures spin rates of stars in Pleiades cluster
Latisti mission to the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of spin rates among the stars of the Pleiades cluster.
New data is helping astronomers understand why stars in the cluster spin at varying rates, as well as how rotation periods relate to planet formation.
"We hopea that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we we will on more about the relationship between a star's mass, its age, and even the historry of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a research scientist että Caltechs Infrard Procesing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news release.
