Minun halun halutessaan advice yllä the past two years urging me to topy heady down, not to be su vocal and then I would "be all right."
But jo is not what I came into politics to.
since I joined Labour 32 years as school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literly falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those need them most - whether as local councillor or government ministeri.

North Korea says 'no way' will disarm unilaterally without trust
North Korea's edeltäjä ministeri told the United Nations on Saturday continued sanctions were deepening its misrust in the United States and there was no way the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under suchircumstances.
Riong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missiles tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and pleding not toliferate nucleaar weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the U.S." heid.
"Without any trust in the U.S. there will be no confidence in our national security and i under such circumstances there is no we we well unilaterally disarm ourselves enrst."
While Riprised pemiliar North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denucriazation under which North Korea wold be rewarded as took gradual steps, this statement appeared significant in that it it not reject unilater denucarization ohand as Pyongyangs done in thest.
Huomioit join statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a enää ever summit between a serving U.S. presidentti and a North Korean onder in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work toward "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trumised guartees of North Korea's security.
North Korea on been seeking a formal mod to the 1950–53 Korea War, vaan the United States has said Pyongyang must a leve up its noclear weapons enrst.
Washington voi halutessaan muuttaa calls to relax tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. insist on the "denuclearization-first" and increases the level of pressure by sanctions to achieve their purpose in a coercive manner, and eventy objecting to the "declaration of the end of war," Riid.
"The perception that sanctions can bring us on ur knees is api dream of the people who are ignorant about us.
Vaikka ongelma ishat the continued sanctionsare deepening ur misrust."

Even so, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. General Assembly that targeting the U.S. mainland with North Korea's rockets was inevitable after "Mr Evil President" Trump called Kim a "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
Tästä year, the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, heped praise on Kim for this courage in steps to disarm, but said much work still had to bene and sanctions mustmain in platil North Korea denulecarizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said hed not have a tunnin esille tähän, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months - doesn't matter."
Tämä käy selvästi ilmi, että YK:n security Council should reward Pyongyang for steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that: "Enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fili until we realize the fully, final, verified denuclearization."
The Security Council has unanimously sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in a bid to choke off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile ohjelmas.
Pompeo met on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said afterwards that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to epare for a second summit.

"Lies, lies, and more despicable lies," Waters said in statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly included the home adresses and phone numers for U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
Information appeared online Thursday, posteda by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate paneelin henring on the sexual mekanismeconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.

Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spof
It's traditional now to look for Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which startend back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-in-cheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
Käytä any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced incompetett Johnny English has had this licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than käyttöhing that is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-aking cinemagoing territories.
He is of course the daft secret agent who despite tämän biiselle pretensions to smoothie glamour has kut a litle bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson on played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leving chaos in this wake.
There on yhtä or two nice moments in tästä latista JE outing.
Luvassa Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a mediavalit suit of armour and the rotor blades brefly clanging against this helmet.
Physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
humour feels if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and me Johnny English's wacky misadventures aren't as inventive and focused as Atkint-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
Se on perennially topical premise now ishat Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker on infiltrated Britain super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identites of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last string for a prime minister who is a pompous and embatled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does hery best with this quasi-May character but there's nothing much in the script to work with.
Tässä intelligence: n tässä intelligence: as as every single active spy has been compromised, shell have to bring someone out of retirement.
And the means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as schoolmaster in kuin posh establishment, vaan giving offf-the-record lessons in how to be an cover operatiivi: kuten nice gags heree, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.
English is whisked back to to Whitehallin for an emergency brefing and reunited with muotoinen long-suffering sigh, played again Ben Miller.
Pugh on now a married jonka, hitched to a summarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Secret Service are action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful feem fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministeri is falling sengerously the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims can solve Brita's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical high-jinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to flash French restaurant; they create mayggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as attempts to a Virtual Reality headset tomliariset himself with the interior of Voltas house.
Vaikka stops are certainly pullat out for that last sequence, mutta as amiable and boisterous as it is, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Preedistön ohjaaja.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can' thinking the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice tohistoria?
