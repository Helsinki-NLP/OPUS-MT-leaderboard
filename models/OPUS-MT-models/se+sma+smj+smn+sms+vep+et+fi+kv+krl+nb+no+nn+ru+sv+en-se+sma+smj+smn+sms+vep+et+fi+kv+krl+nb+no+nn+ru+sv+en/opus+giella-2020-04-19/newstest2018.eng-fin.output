Resultointia käytetään sanctions imediatelyä in latata tals
Kuten tuntia on, ettei näytä seeman nähdä US-Russia relations were turning from cold to hot.
When meeting, the G20 summit in Hamburg, Donald Trump, the President of the USA, and Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, seemed toget along nicely.
Later on, the relationship has become notably colder.
Venäjällä on showed a bitter response to the new economic sanctions appreoved last week by the US Congress and signed by Trump on Wednesday.
Voit sellaisen toiminnan perusteena olevan usein usein sanomalehdistön responsion response haluaa leveästi, joka on useita sanctions bill signed by Trump will result in a "full-scale trade war."
Even if the Russian responses were shrugged of merely as exaggerations and aggravations belonging to political rhetoric, the increased tension between the USA and Russia is a fact, following the short honeymoon after Tru's election.

Now Trump's White House is tarkistus the Statue of Liberty
Surest mark of regrema change is when they start attacking the statues.
Tämä as well as anyone - hence the carefullly stage-manged toppling of Saddam Hussein in Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller on of the key ideotalles of the Trump regime, surely knew what he was doing when heok a symbolic axe to the Statue of Liberty in a heated argument with CNN's Jim Acosta yllä the presidentin proposals to drastically limit leglegal immigration.
Ei fairness, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
Horde of Bot-trip owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if hed.
Kuuntele ja laula kolea, joka koskee asioita, sen sijaan on useissa tapauksissa myös muissa maissa, joissa elävät niin kutsuvia, että ne ovat oikeaa päässääntöjä, eli niin years after the monument itself was completed.
Ohjelma Miller scolded Acosta: "I don't want to get a whole thing about history heree, vaan the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American liberty ligting the world.
The poem that you're reference to, that was antaa later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, mutta as he put eli himself, tämä is no really about historia.
Its is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus- s startling words, the on on on yes in which a state has appeared to invite not just any immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, / The wretched refse of youring shore."
Therellä on nävera a tunti when the "wretched refse" haluaa been more visible on our screens.
Miller was not enging in literary criticism - he was making it clear that these people are no welcome in Trump's USA.
Tämä conflict about the meaning of a statue is osa on wider political and cultural war: its really a conflict about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and tästä friends who campaigned to place her words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were enging in a highly political act.
Se sculpture-was intended to markkina the yhdistyctions between French and American republicanism bys edustaja in well-worn classical trope, the viemale embodiment of Liberty.
Lazarus changed that meaning: in her poem the viemale figure is no longer abstract - she has a voice.
And asves herself a very different nime: Mother of Exiles.
Marrying of the poem to the image is a brilliant feministin coup and a kuvitus attack on American nativism.
Pysäytä tasoa as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, rightwingers have long wanted to change it back.
The great loudmouth Rush Limbaugh, akind of John the Baptist for Trump, argued in 2010 that Liberty is not inviting anyone in, but its rather an arly neocon, taking the American flame out to the benighted world: "Lady Liberty is stepping forward.
Hän is mennin carrying the torch of liberty from the United States to the rest of the world.
United States."
Rather unusually, Limbaugh actually hit on something.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a matter of the angle of perception.
Lazarus - s great imaginative act was to see as would be seen by exhausted, wretched but hopeful people on the decks of ships after long and of dreadful journeys.
Its is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refge and a chance to better their lives.
Tässä kohdassa on kysymys statueeseen back tos em the words of hope and welcome they ned sine hear.
Uusi course: Tämä is not the perspective Miller and Trump want ever to recognise.
Their torch is menet not sub light the way, mutta se on inflame the hatreds that are their only source of power.

Blocking critics from Facebook: Don't run for public office, jos you can't takee heat from voters

He chafed at the criticism, sure.
Käyttökirjoilla ei ole yksinkertaista, jotta kirjain ei ole tarpeellinen.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "the freedom of Speech may be taken away - and, dumb & silent we be led, lika sheep, to the Slaugtere."
Larry Hogan, who neds to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan' s staff has blocked and deleted the posts of at on st 450 people who voida their opinions on se official Facebook page.

Sekä governor's staff disseded the lawsuit as frivous, and the onne commentary with with 'who cares?" backlash.
"It's only Facebook," plenty of folks said.
Mutta ei matters.
Käytä especially matters when it's a guy like Hogan.
Tämä is is Republican governor in an yliwhelming Democratic state who is astonishingly popular.

En anna interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions, argument that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating them.
Voit it's too esy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful folks lashing out online.
The Post selkeä to som of the real people blocked by Hogan.
Takaisin teacherin teacherin johdosta that - real people talking to their elected läders: a teacher, a business owner and a pastor, not trolls.
They kaikki said thathat their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
Pastorin quotella the Bible in this post, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
Politely commented that I was disappointed in this lack of response to crimes and other recent news items,” she wrote in the comment section of The Post's news story.
"E kaiso do not appreciate that when a number of people comment on the same topic, they are immediately by som as so-called collective effort, rather than recognized as largege group of concerned citzens."
What the governor's staff called a "concentrated cam attack" others would probably call "advocacy."
Tietokone on epätodennäköinen a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's lot cleaner than the old days, when doing the same would have required sending staff out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening, only digitaali.
Hogan isn't the first public official to be criticized for defanging Facebook and other social media.

Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the presidenti' s media diet.
Muutos on triedin ja virheellinen.
SaKaste-hanke
Jos hän, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in the hope of keeping the bos on a more even keel.
Bit from reporteri Josh Dawsey:
"When new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly huddled with senior staff on se first day at work, heutlined a key ongelma in President Donald Trumps White House that he planned to fix: bad information getting into the presidentin hands.
Kelly told the staff that information need to flow through him - whether on paper  or in brefinging - because the president wold make better decisions if given good information.»
Kelly's diagnosti makeas perfect sensese, muilta osittain vähennetään tried and virheellä to tamaa Trump yms monitorointi tämän median sitä.
Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, tät TV-watching habit is tyyli going strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair coverage, eit was productive to show him that he was getting fair coverage from outlets that were persuadable,” Samnberg, a former campaign adviser, toldco in February.
Politicons Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six muotoja campaign officials, is to ensure that tämän personal media consumption includes a stey stream of praiseemp."
Okay.
Vaikka Trump's Twitterin habit on everbeen "under control" is laughable.
Maybe these campaign officials know something the rest of don't - that Trump's tweets would have been even more inflammatory if not for their interventions.
Vähitellen tweets that Trump din't sendä.
Jos tämä stafferin manageri, hän haluaa out of trouble event a few times, their efforts were worthwhile.
Kuten edellä on sellaista, niin kutsutaan se, ettei to consistently prevent Trump from hallring up controversy.
Beata of the ongelma is that in in White House composed of competing factions, people invariably try to advance their agendas by presidentti Trump with material - which may or may not beliable - that promotes their worldviews.
Politico - kaikki kautta tämän suuy - reported in May on advisers' penchants for strategically feeding dubious information to the presidentti.
Tässä was on example, described by rapporter Shane Goldmacher:
" Trump officials say Trump can react volcanically to negatiivinen press clips, especially those with damaging leks, becoming egrossed in finding out where they originated.
That is what happened in late February when someone mischivously loppua the presidentin a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, which accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being 'theurce behind a bunch of the White House.
No matter that Johnson had had been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that heffred no concrete eidence or that hed had lobbed false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump Read the article and began asking staff about Walsh."
Goldmacher annetaan that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House staff secretary Rob Porter "have tried to implement systema to manage and dokument the paperwork Trump receives."
Håiko hakea olevaa?
Kelly is trying to the samisk thing, three months later.
Perhaps he will prove a more effective manager than Pribus, mutta trump impulsive self, and se aides are ar still vying for influence.
Those immutable factors will make Kelly's mission very difficul.

Eventhough many have heard of Widenius and the billion dollar MySQL deal, not many in Finland know anything about MariaDB:sta.
"Ei recent years, we've ground by about 50 per cent a year", says Kenneth Paqvalén, CFO että MariaDB.
Vaikka MariaDB on growth, not on profitti, and Paqvalén has little to say about the company key figuri.
Heidät reveal that MariaDB expects to obtain new orders worth 20 miljoonaa eurosta satunnainen tämän financialin periodin.
Because the database is free of charge, the company has developed auxiliary services for which corporate customers aready toy pay.
MariaDB also helps to exchange databases, which may takaa more than yms if a customer has used a closed database.
Switch frå MySQL ton MariaDB is quick and easy, as the two are different versions of each other.
Example, Telefónica, a Spanish telecom operaattor, and DBS, the largest bank in Southest Asia, are paying customers of MariaDB.
The millainen popular cloud-palvelu, such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure and Aliba Cloud, offer MariaDB to their customers.
Automaattically to new users through Linux operating järjestelmä packages in which MariaDB has largely replaced MySQL.
Even tuulet we are small company, we are yhdistetään enjoyden players.
"Olan customers include the world's largest telecom operators, game developers, banks and even a few central banks", Paqvalén says.
Database markkinointi is tyylin dominated by giants, such as Oracle, Microsoft, IBM and SAP, with their closed databases.
Oracleihin MySQL means a modest secondary business opportunity compared with its traditional closed database.
Though the largest database companies have lest their shares according to research company Gartner, players such as MariaDB are small and insignificant firms, albeit quickly growing on, measured by sales.
In the database market of roughly 50 miljoonaa dollars, open source databases cannot even reach the threshold of lie billion.
However, the significance of open source software kannot be measured in money alone, as the majority of users dot pay käyttöhing for its use.
Gartner estimet that in 2018, companies will develop more than 70 per cent of their internal applications using open source databases.
En annusta, hän half of older databases will be replaced by open suurce databases, ts. tähän transition will have been initiatit.
"Major corporations do not obtain new customers, as most users select open source software.
Tämä means that the licence fees of commercial databases are kyh.
Kompanjas want to mikee as much money as they used to to, with fewer customers, Widenius says.
Ilmoituksen pääkän atkiä work of work to replaces a closed database, josta customera companies have quitly accepted the increased prices.
"We have many customers for which it's really difficul to makea tästä transition, because their applications and other solutions are tied to a closed database", says Widenius.
Hän tyyli korkealta that customers will soon had enough.
Licencen fees kun higher yher after year, customers will eventually switch to anna source database.
Is better, as customers can esily change to another database.
Seuraavassa koskee myös muita asioita, joihin käytetään yhdistelmäpohjaa. Muutama terveyden- ja sairaanhoidossa tapahtuvaa palvelua.
Se, kuka on saamelainen tunti, many want to endringge their database software.
Lasta lähetys, MariaDB acquired a lohta of 25 miljoonaa eurosta from the European Investment Bank (EIB).
Tämä was the largest growth loan ever saadaan by the EIB in the Nordic countries.
115 employes around the world, and it intends to hir more.
Obtaining from the EIB was the impact MariaDB has on public IT procurement.
The company on public sectorin customers in the UK and Germany, among others.
In Europea, the public sector is paying billions of eurosta a ympäri tietopaseeni.
"Many countries want to adoptin open source solutions and therefore, use tax revenue more effectively", Paqvalén says.
Widenius is ei happy about how Finland is spending money on, say, closed healthcare systems, while open sources are cheper and not the client to a ingle software company.
Kuinka say tot opan suurce is an ideology, mutta I belve that its a better way of coding.
You cannot invent or do.
Alongside another Finn, Linus Torvalds, the developer of Linux, Widenius, 55, ye of the best known contributors to open source software.
Widenius helps other companies to develop functional business models on top of open source.

"The greatest eror is to live in Mexico and to bea journalist," Valdez wrote in ye of this books on narco-violence.
Huksella absence is eply deeply, although se presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez displaying that midtle finger, with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building; two reporters on their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear Tshirts that smiling, bespectacled face or his transmamaapamaat.
Workshop takee place than two months after th: the reporters discus their shared trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.

Seuraava Riodoce, they persist in covering the violence of Sinaloa, though they are heartbroken, though the terrain is more treacherous now.
Without tieto on the keillers, without justice, the meeting to discus security, says Ibarra, is of litle.
"Et's very foolish to waste my time in se workshop," heys.

Rumors tend to freely in Culiacan.
Kuten edellä on selostettu, subject of Valdez, there's practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa on been ye of the country's blodiest batlegrounds as rival factions fight to the vacuum.
Never mind the someone or several people are are shot dead in the street every day in Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filed with ornate, two-stoleums for drugings, larger than many homes for the living.
Valitse a minute that a state of "calm" is when just on ye cartel is in control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug-trafficking routes to the United States.
Despite that, and the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the perils of this work, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is with guilt for failing to friend.
Hänen kokemustaan beallevieras two erors contributed to the killing.
First there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, adader of ye of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman's sons.
Yksityiskohtainen pyhä angered the sons; suspected kers metrin lought up every copy of the edition as they were delivered to newsstands.
Second takaa was not forcing Valdez to leve the country for this safety after the seizure of another newspaper that carried the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, this killing is seen as menetelmä Mexican violence against journalists.
Heidi Survived for song, se friends and colleagues assumed he'd always be there.
He was a veteran reportoivat Noroeste in 2003 when heined five colleagues in creating Riodoce, selling >50 shares.

Ylikirjoita time the paper erned a reputation for brave and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporterin laadin being able to publish hard-hiting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories nobody tered to cover.
Yleisö after Riodoce was founded, it won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot award for corage in Latin America.
Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for this courage in pursuing the Mexican drug store wherever it ledd.

Ei olemassa pitänyt kiemurta, 'What were you doing in the face of much deat... why din't you say what was going on?'
The Riodoce staff misses Valdez, the jokester who swore like a longshoreman, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew to survive.

"Those things were offf-limits" said Bojorquez.
Result is, even in the best of times, a high-level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Hyväksy one's instincts.
Jos it smells wrong, stay away.
Trouble, said Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal, ishat "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and the thing with Javier happened."
The ollen rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they don't in Tamaulipas, Verracruz, Guerro and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials.

Half-joking, jotka of the reporters wondered whather these officers are among the 50 percent of cops whom the governor himself häs saidare not trustworthy.
Ei ole päässyt month since the reporters have kun into the mountainous countryside, where the drugs gangsare in de facto control.
Tämän week's edition Riodoce was looking three joista suuria.
There was the killing ofmers boxing great Julio Cesar Chavez s brother in Sinaloa.

"Before, we would have already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" tämän slenderin buildin.
"Now kaikki channels of communication with ur sources have been broken."
Valdez's office on maksimia repurposed as storage room for signs and stickers protesting journalist killings, as stave have become something they expected to: activists on behalf of the press.
Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few of the signs and headed out the next morning for a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office yet another journalist.
Salvador Adame diappeared in the western state of Michacan three days after Valdez was killed.
Vaikka kirjain tarkoittaa, että tekee tutkittavaa tutkimusta tai ettei se, pesepä on DNA tests.
Nationwide, journalists have become more vocal, scrawling "SOS Press" on sidewalks and building in organized protests.
Se on tämä päivä, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to rally international support for justice in the Valdez case.
Valdez was killed, Ramirez authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
Hän olen sincen uudelleen pyytänyt ressigned from covering the government, concerned that her anger hart her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatly said that journalists in Mexico are "suruunded" by organized crime, complicit government officials and an indifferent society.
En sitä last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are being killed not om bydrug gangs but on the order of politicians and security forces in cahoots with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 attributed more than half of attacks on journalists last year to police and public officials.

It's incredible well preserved state on tunnettu researchers, who describe it as 'truly remarkable'
The armoured plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to reportsin in National Geographic.
Ei was found by Shawn Funk, when he was parantaminen että the Suncor Millenium Mine neara Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He something which seemed out of place from the surrounding rock, and decided to takea a closer look.
He fossil he uncovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years working on uncoving the best within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg) valokuvaaja.
Muodostaa kaikki that garra work, the finished epäonnistui.
Vaikka squint yuu eyes a bit, yleinen bjekt it was sleeping,' said on author Caleb Brown, a scientist että the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is on display.
"Et will kun down in science history as on of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs. "
Tuo studying its skin, researchers found that se plant-eater, though covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, likely faced a significant threat from meat-eating dinosaurs.
Hehvily armoured dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used byy many modern-day animals.
Tämä would have allowed it to better katho koostuva into its suruunding and evade its enkel, experts say, suggestus eit was preyed on by larger dinosaurs.
Yhteistyötä uudistetaan yleispohjoismaiseksi neljännen apura-alkuperäisella tavalla.
Researchers have now studio and named the best Borealopel markmitchelli after museo technician Mitchell, ye of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours paintakly uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr Mitchell and an internasjonal team of scientists to dokument the pattern and shape of scales and armour acros its body.
They discovered countershading, common method of defence in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was tarker than its underside.
Although countershading is common, the findings come as surprise because Borealopelta's size exceeds that of countershaded animals aliive today.
Ei syystä the dinosaur was hunned by enough presori meat-eeting dinosaurs that evolution favoured confrontation as a means of survival.
Seuraava sivusto on erottanut yhdistetty countershading -- think deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable as prey, signaling signaling that se nodosaur faced a real struggle to survive.
'Strong predation on a massive, hevily-armored dinosaurin piirtäjällä jot how sengerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been,' said Brown.
Chemical analyys of organic compounds in itscales also reveal that the dinosaur's skin would haveen peen brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut contents to out what it ate fort last meal.
Sekalaiset, jotka eivät täytä dinosaurin tiedostoa, eivät virhee a river and was sweept out to sea, where et sank on its back to the ocean floor.
Alberta was warm as south Florida is today, and rivers and oceans likely spread as further inland than they do now.
'Hinnot nodosaur is uhka remarkable inthat it is completely cored in preserved scaly skin, yts is alle puserved inthree dimensions, retaining the original shape of the animal,' said Brown.
'The result is at the animal looks yleensä the saamelainen today as it back in the Early Cretaceus.

The Cretaceous was a time when tanssi theropods, meat-eating dinosaurs that stood on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the king of them al, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived million of yms after Borealopelin, the armoured dinosaur kan have yen hunted by joko its formidle ancestors.
They include Acrocanthosaurus, a 38ft (11.5m) long monster weighing six tonnes.
scientists, whose latest finding appear in the journal Current Biology, believe Borealopel washed out to seaa after it fort and mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was digging at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museo, its the beserved armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armour, and is complete from the snout to hips.
The creatures were around 18 feet (five metres) long on average, and weighted up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Ei featored two 20-inch-long spaikes which protrude from its houlders.
Researchers belve that the se armored plant-eater lumbered through what is now western Canada, until a flooded river sweeept it into open sea.
Vaikka dinosaurissa on hyvä painollinen, its armor in exquisite- yksityiskohtainen.
Se fossilised remains of tämä parlamentticular specimen are so well preserved that remnants of skin still cor bumpy armour plates along the dinosaur's kuul.
Is Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such level of preservation 'is a rare as winning the lottery.

How on yhden activist came haluaa se answer to the question: 'Whose Streets?'
Esityksen on Aug. 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was was shaken to her core.
Jos aote arvelusta in New York City on a tript, the St. Louis native sat on the bed of an Airbnb she was renting, scrolling through Facebook on tästä phone.
She rauha upon a post from mieone from high school.
"The police joutua kiilled an 18 year syeara kid and he's still laying in the street," it read.
Tietoa epäonnistui, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Useimmissa tapauksissa on käytössä@TheePharoat was being constantly retweeted onto her timeline.
The St. Louis-area avaa was live-tweting the teath of Michael Brown, anta unarmed black 18-year killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Voi olla postia pictureja Brown's lifeless body stretched out in the street, where it would stay for fours.
"This is wild, " Ferrell thought to herself.
Muitakin teatteriesitys was nothing new for her and her community.
Phone teeman aloitussivulle tarkoittaa ohjeita eri puolilta Suomea, eli lateria, jotka evening to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of police tape and people yelling, and of a guy claiming to be Brown's father hiding a sign that read, "Ferguson police omt killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking aina.
En another video, different cop, she said, cocked se rifle and screamed, "I'll kill all you... animals."
"This is ei usualinen, " Ferell recalled saying.
" Tähän isn' t the type of murder that we've become used to and can call typical. "
In that komentin I elementin elementin chills.
I was angry and crying."
Hän booked a return flight and went home the next day.
Jumalaa, että tällä hetkellä täysin on 11 p. p. shecked up tästä 6-year-ogtri from herd 's house and decided the two of the wold head to Ferguson the next morning.
Three years is the subject of new dokumentary, "Whose Streets?" in theaters Aug. 11.
It's a tale of survival and protest, lue and loss, strength and resilience from the vantage point of the people who live in the community and packed the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell kätkee Ferguson kohta Ferguson with her augtere, who wearing a floraal dress and matching crown, the two revisited a conversation they'd had countless forefore that morning "about the black experience and black condition."
"Jokaa how I taught yo about when black people had to fight for what they belied in?" she recalled saying.
"We" kuning to Ferguson right now because the police killelt an 18-year-old boy and it wasn't right.
Icouldn't ei täsmää, "Fererell said lateria.
" Tähän häppenning today is a culmination of... that happened in the past.
It neds and see and be raised in.
Se needs to be well developed in the area of not just activism and organizing but knowing the different layers of the black experience and the black condition and what we must to gree, to free ourselves.
Even if Im fortunate enough to provideo siitä an an experience where she doesn't henkilöäly experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black woman-child.
Epäkelpoinen I would be heraa a disservice to shild her from that."
First stop when they arived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a site across from the police department that became a campground of the activists aword of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual non-indictment.
There Ferrell and her augteri linked up with a local business owner who was making sack lunches.
Pieni prepared bagss and helped pass them out to protesters.
Slowly, new type of activism behgan merkille shape for Ferrell.
"My activism completely transformed after Aug. 9," she said, noting that while an issud at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Asn. and focused on food justice and health disparities in black communities.
"In had no experience in organizing.
Et kaikki mikä tahansa came."
Weks later, Ferell met Sabat Folayan, one of the elokuvam's co-directors, turing an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her director of photography Lucas Alvarado-Farrar "just wanted to dokument" what was happening.
A question came to Ferell's mind: "Ho want to dokument or are yo trying to story that yo yo can exploit?"
Takaa skepticism was informed by countless instances of people - of white - coming into a community to profit of its pain and resilience.
Vaikka Folayan explained in a recentin interview, "We had heard that people who are raised in Ferguson were not having their voices centered, and we we wanted to it differently."
Folayan had joready linked up with co-director Damon Davis, anarea artist known for this activism around death row inmates.
Mikäli involvement endeared Ferll to the projekti, along with six other locals the "Whose Streets?" teeman followed in the years after Brown's shooting.
Tieto dokumentary is not somebody speaking for us or speaking to us, it's speaking,” Davis said.
"That was the mainta thing for me, how these people will be edustavat, because that's how I will be edustaja."
While the goal wasn't to focus on Ferell experience - in an effort to that the movement is "not about a messiah leder but a community coming together," Folayan said - sheved to the most open of the film's participants.
As a) tulostimen "Whose Streets?" dokuments surprisly henkilökohtainen aspects of Ferrell's life, lika falling in love and marrying her wife.
Ei epäonnistui I was naked, said Ferell, laughing about the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I lähdeod that with doing dette work and humanizing black folks, there has to be alevel of lnerability."
Ferellin suuri reiterates and re-centers the role of black queer women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - who coined #BlackLivesMatter on social media in the aftermath of the 2012 killing of black ten Trayvon Martin - identify as queer.
"Black queer women in leadership has sustained the movement overall," said Ferell, "and that's because we're constantly at battle on multiple fronts.
Black queer women havellaan tahansa kaikkea brunt of it."
Esimerkiksi Folayan agreed noting that 'he movement is really upheld by black women and a lot of queer black women.'
She insists, however, that "this is not som affirmative action type of thing" where Ferrell was chosen as the film's heart because of her identiteettis.
"She was the person who was galvanizing se energy," she said.
"Et's not a coincidence though she was on the front lines, because living life että those intersections as a black queer woman, you have soch on the line.
Voit olla tapahtunut tästä energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the news cameras are long gone put fraught racial oss between the community and police persist.
Varell is on probation for 21⁄2 more years for blocking a highway duringa demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area shells home simply: "A mes."
Still, she clings to a chant she's committed to memory since taking to Ferguson streets a täydet yms ago.

Becoming Resemblance: artisti kanava using Chelsea Manning
New York: n Fridman Gallery are multiple faces - white, black and brown, ech pearan an alimin imperceptible resemblance toe on another - suspended on wires from the ceiling.
The 30 verkkoraportti were created by the artisti Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and hair clipping sent to tästä by Chelsea Manning.
Senaatti sent the clippings from the Fort Leavenworth palison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after famously leking classified diplomatic cables through the website WikiLeaks.
New exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is titled Acoming Resemblance.
It's the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident who sentence was commuted Barack Obama when hedhed jos three days let off infice.
Algorithmically analyzing DNA extracted from Manning and using it to create 30 portreads of what someone with that genomic data might look likeke, Dewey-Hagborg has created a trenchant, if somewhat cerebral, commentary on notly the malleability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreed, and the inherentation - butity.
who as born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as woman as adolescence, was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including six Espionage Act violations, computer fraud and theft.
Hienkilökohtaisesti, tästä image was repressed, soch so that there was just one photo - a granular, black-and-white selfie in which Manning, visibly uneasy, sits in a driver wearing a platinum blog - with which she became associated.
Ein 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was coming of the massive success of tästä 2012 projektiactin, Stranger Visions.
En it, the artist produced versio of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette buts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the detritus to conjure anmage of what these folks mig look likeke.
Käynnissä oleva was when received for email from Paper Magazine.
"They were conducing an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted som kind of raportit to accompany that article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't be visited and she couldn't be photographed atthat time, the soy reached out to Chelsea and asked if she'd be interested in having a DNA raportit made.
Artisti ja tästä incarcereted museo pecame unlikely pens, exchanging several letters yllä the course of two years.
They even: a comic book, Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, that envisioned a future where the presidentti would commute Chelsea's sentence and she'd able to the exhibition in person.
That Obama would indeed call for Manning's release jos after the book went public was welcome sort of serendipity after seven brutal years, että A- military prison in Kansassa.
There's also something profound and powerful about the exhibition opening now, as Donald Trump wages war on government onkers and transgender troops while finding new, tweetable ways to further inflame the stark divisions hes been called on tod.
Verkkoaluekohtainen abouta the peculiar timing of it all, Dewey-Hagborg said that "things happen for a reason."
Ei ana artist statementia written on the gallery's wall, Manning's super-sized signature below it (the "i" in her last name dotted with a heart), called for end to the "automatic factionalism that gender, race, sexuality, and culture have been the basis of."
Seuraava opiskelija wall is is tästä mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Tun including the 200 letters ( tai nucleotides, per the artist's sophisticated scientific lexicon), Dewey-Hagborg hoped to illustratee how astoundly similar, että onst inbiological makeup, we all are.
"What I'm hoping that people will takaa away from tät is that our genome doesn't care about we are, and how open genetic data is to interpretation, how subjective it its," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, isso on display.
"DNA data can tell son many different stories, hän tästä is 30 of those suuria."
Finnal bie in the exhibition, which is contained in a single room, is ye page from the aforementioned graphic novella.
It shows Manning, emerging, King Kong-esque, from the United States Disiplinary Barracks with speakerphone in hand.
"When they chill your speech, then they've won, it reads.
"So nver shut up."
"Ei came directly from a letter that she wrote to me," the artist, who hails from Philadelphia, said.
"Ei kudota about it."
Sähköpostiosoite: n Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in-person yet - as was so presciently imagined in the comic book - but shen she does, she'll be greeted in the center of the room by the masks, hero own genomic simulacra congregated like hordes of protesters.
That was purposeful, too, as is is everything in the exhibition, down to the height (5"2, Manning's stature) että which her genetic haplogroups were were pencil.
"In the past, I've had them on the wall but I wanted the to feel likea a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the raportits.
"In wanted it to elä neljännen movementin thathat was forming with Chelsea, yhtä the movement that was behind freeing her as well."

While suffers are usually advisit to dodge meat and dairy to soothe their symptoms, researchers että Washington University found protein essential amino tryptophan helps develops immune cells thathat foster a tolerantti kunnioit.

Professori Colon saita: "We established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacilus reuteri - that is normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had. "
Hän kiinnittää huomiota saamelaisen works in humans, combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diet may foster a more tolerant, less inflammatory environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barganwas studying a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she discovered that one group of study mice cells but another group of the same strain but housed separately did nod not.
She suspected the difference had to with the mice-s gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normal live within the gastrointinal tract.
Kuts of the mice were DNA sequenced and it was found six bacterial bacies present in the mice with the immune cells but absent from the mice without them.
Mice reared in sterile environment so they lacked a gut microbiome and do not develop this kind of immune cell were given L. reuteri and the immune cells arose.
To kierroksena how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without bacteria - kaksi immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
Vein the active component was purified from the liquid, eit turned out a byproduct of tryptopan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
Tryptopantin in the mice-feed, the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice-s feed, the numero of such cells ryse by about 50 percent but when tryptophan levs were halved, the cells droped by half.
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and most of us shelter L. reuteri in uor gastrointinal tracts.
Its ei known whether tryptops byproducts from L. reuteri induce the cells to develop as they do in mice, but defects ingenes related to tryptophan have been found infoople with inflammatory bowel disease.
The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially, high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may induce expansion of this population.'
