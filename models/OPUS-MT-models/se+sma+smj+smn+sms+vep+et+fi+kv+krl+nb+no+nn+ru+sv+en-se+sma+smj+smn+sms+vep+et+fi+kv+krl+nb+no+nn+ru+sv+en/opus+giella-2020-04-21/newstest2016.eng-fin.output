Herere's will happen when the Fed raises interest rates
Rate hakee will come and the bull markkinointi will tumble, bond yields will climb and the economy will slip into a recession.
Tämä verkko on syvä.
Käytetäänkö we 't' t know is how long all of that will takee and how long it will last.
Koska sellaisella tavalla on historia, yhdistelmäkirjas, yhdistänyt aboutin tunnistetta.
A recession voi nostaa come as quickly as 11 months after the first rate hike and as long as 86 months.
Aggressivenes in raising rates is often, though not always, a determinant in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That's why officials että the U.S. central bank have stressed so vigorously that investors should not focused on when it starts raising rates but rather the trajectory of how long it will take to normalize.
Puhe, saamelainen indeed, multiple variabelissa että play.
In the end, however, markit participants may find that all the rate-hiljainen may have enempää.
"The enää hiki from the Fed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by som as signaling the end of the era of 'chanp money, " Julian Jessop, chief global economisessa Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normaali but tyyl low levels to be the seismic shock that many yem to eri foorume.
That's ei ole say there won't be effects, however.
Here's a loo, että how some areas of the economy could react, pesead on historiacal trends:
Markkinasuojelualue on ylläpitänyt the past month or so, anticipation of rate hikes kan minke things volatile for while.
Once the hiki hits, though, the impact is no dramatic.
"Et does seem there is a trend for equity returns to stall 12-24 months after the first hike, which again perhaps reflects the lag in monetary policy, " Deutsche Bank analysts said in recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes.
More specifically, the market over the past 35 years or so is most of ten up sharply - about 14 percent - heading into the rate hike, fairly fat in the 250 days after (average gain of 2.6 percent) then back to normal once 500 days have passed, with avage return in the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to recent analyys Bobll, chif ef equitys strategista at Nuveen Asset Management on Barrons.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to get more pronounced later in the rate-hiking cycle and returns begin to diminish.
Recessionsare a fact of economic life, muhto rate hikes often help the along.
En sitä ikkunan case, the Fed is facing som conditions that not exist before and could hasten a recession.
Ennen notably, gross domestict product will be neliä lowestin point ever a Fed rate hike.
Tyynioring to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 rate hikes since 1950, onli twice has nominal yeara yeara GDP been below 4.5 percentiä.
Even tuthough the second quarter of 2015 was että 3.6 percent, few expect that to last, with the third quarter tracking ja oire, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Hikking rates into such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and set up the question of "wwhether this time is different," Deutsche said.
Markkina parlamentaarikko Feederal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
While many strategista and economiss belve the FOMC could approve a hiki että se meeting, futures trading indicates a 25 percent probability.
Seuraava study since 1950, kaikki hiking cycles to date in a super cycle of increasing leverage with GDP eclipsing prerecession peax very quickly post the recovery commencing," the report said.
Kysymys tästä on päällä uniquely slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the sample period.
Seuraantainen cycle is by the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record had been 35 months, and se is on 74 months and counting.
Fixed income also has been volatile as the markkint anticipates a rate hike, and the pattern is somewhat similar to what equities experience.
Principal difference is that the impact happns in bonds than stocks when the Fed changes course in policy.
Bonds - ohjelmassa, ei does see yeilds change direction immediately as the first hike/cut in the cycle arives.
Yksi teema " Deutsche saidi.
Charles Schwab strategis belve the hikes in rates will cause yields between longer- and shorter-dated bonds to move closer together, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds of ten perform better in such a climate, though "we are still cautious about stretching for yeeld," Kathy Jones, fixed income analyysiin.
Interestointily, Jones thinkmarkets already have adapted to Fed policy expectations.
Et annetaan to the strength in the dollar and the drop inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market on adjusted to the prospect of tigtary monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates are up, the yeld curve is flatter, credit bireads have widened and volatility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the Fed tigttens policy.
Broadly spekeing, companies that do the majority of their business in the U.S. will win as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with lots of debts of will fare worse. as rising dollar, makes their products more expensive in the global market space and their debt more expensive the finance.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks tend to outperform during the three months following an initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets outpaced weak balance sheet companies following of the 1994, 1999, and 2004 rate hikes, by anerage of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high returns on capital as well as low volatility stocks also outperformed their lower quality counterparts, an an avage of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big liima.
Tietyt companies with high percentage of flating sanoo debt stand to lose the most, Goldman said.

Experts criticise Public Health England e-cigarettes review
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettesare 95% less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, joka with links to the tobacco industry, researchers have said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticising the eidence used by Public Health England (PHE) ints report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the "landmark" report last month, describing it as  "comprehensive review of the evidence."
Several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Ana editoriaalin in the Lancet medical journal last month attacked the "extraordinarily flimsy foundation" on which PHE based its hvor concluion.
Writing in the BMJ, two further researchers have questioned whether the claims were "built on rock or sand."
Martin McKe, professori of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of publiciple of forthat policies should besed on evidence of effeciveness."
They said the public would expect PHE's claims that " that e-cigarettes are around 95% less harmful than smoking" would be based on detailed review of evidence and modelling.
In fact, eit comes from a single meeting of 12 people convened to develop a multi-criteria decision decision analysissa (MCDA) model to synthesise their opinions on the harms associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarised in a research paper.
McKe and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was reported to have previous receiveding funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He alle endorsed BAT:n public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
Yhtenä of the 12 people että the meeting declared funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding he was reported to have reviously from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they antaa.
Rationaali for selecting the members of the panel is not provided, but they include several known e-cigarette champions, som of whom also declare industry funding in the paper.
Kuten edellä on mainittu, the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was al attended by the tobacco on attendea.
Yhteistyötä: ” Tietokone ”, Yhteistyötä ja useampia muita juuria ” - paper produced by the group ” tellly concedes” there is lack of "hard evidence for the harms of most products on most of the criteria,” McKe and Capewell wrote.
However, eine of these links or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKe and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no eidence so that e-cigarettes are acting as route into smoking for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the claims in the BMJ had been responded to foreelle.
He sai: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
Tänään in two lifelong smokers, from theirin anction.
All of the evidence syntyisin that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are small by comparison, vaat we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE:lle on se sellaista tutkia to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially when there web much public confosion about the relative tämängers compared tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 peoplea y year the smoking-related illness and smoking costs the NHS ̈2bn a year.

Suoratoista to se how it's public service broadcasting.
Itse'think- think- epäonnistui the BBC että kaikki.
Johnson, a serialet entrepreneur who led Channel 4 from 2004 to, said the BBC was guilty of chasing ratings "because of the ambitions of people who work there, and because the believe that is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments about the BBC's most popular shows echo those of muoto Sky executive Tony Ball, who used tämän MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 tou proposes that the BBC seff shows such as AnstEnders.
Johnson saida the BBC: n more niche public service- ohjelmasta "go on to BBC4 where quite of yan't measure the audience but the fulfil their remit and they can argue when go on their sanctimonious missions about justifying in licence fee income, "Well of course, "we all these obscure ohjelmas that on noe watched."

Executive David Elstein, who also gave evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BC should revise its Reithian mission to "info, educate and entertain."

The criises in the world economy have resurfaceced Karl Marx (1818-1883) and this magnum opus, Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, writes Yrjö Hakanen, known as the former chairman of the Communist Party of Finland (SKP), in the book published today, Marxin Pääoman ajankohta (the tocality of Marxs Capital).

But Marx will no help with tomoruws government decisions.
Hakemisto to henkilökohtainen capitalism was sipeless case that should just be ceased.
Amocin Korkman tyyli think Marx is worth reading up on.
"Ei was impossible to read Marx in the 1970s", says Korkman.
"Maoists and Trotskyists and other sects all hated capitalism, but they hated ech other even."
Now the discussion is more diverse, and its possible to approach also Marx without the ideological and political baggage of the past years.
"Every social scientista should read up on Marx's ideologies - jos like all the other classics, too", says Korkman.

Media researcher: Sipilä is taking a big risk
Varied channels are ned in communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches are one channel among others.
Tämä kind of direct speech will be need in the future, sinua.
Tämä will ei be the last time, Sipilä told the reporters in the parliament.
Sipilä did yet want to esimate how recurrent these premier's speeches broadcasted through television and radio are going to be.
According tos Sipiläin, the speeches will not necessarily always be broadcast from Yle channels.

It is alle leppä in Yle Areena.
Sipila is takaing risk
Media researcher sipes that Sipilän televisied speech is not a symptom of the government's more general turn inwards.
Is the goal to takaa the right to define public discussion more tightly in their own hands and to turn down the framing of questions in the public discussion? Anu Koivunen, a professori in the University of Stockholm contemplates.
Tällä reminds me of the Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini's recent comment about how he will not follow the medias agenda, nor will he let e define himself.
In the name of democratic discussion and publicity I hope that these matters are not related.

Tämä is vaara Yle, as well, in the sense that if tätä turns out to be special situation but jout a routine speech among others.
Yle labelled as a medium for politicians or the parliament or the government, which would most definitely not be in line with Yle's interests or the government, which would most definily not be in line with Yle's interests or general policy.

He compares Sipilä muodostaa fatherin figuria, who is now telling the people what to they need to do.
If Sipilä voi halutessaan put se points well, ei kanna work.

Instead they demonstrate how the economy and the markets have previously tarvitsee sanomuutta ja after Fed interest hikes, using cool facts and calculations.
Et annetaan tukea historiallisen observations they also analyse which essential variables of economy and the financial markets are now the same or different level than during irlier interest hikes - and what are the possible implicationss.
Its is evidentt that both the economy and the financial markets are now weaker to withstand a rate hike than ever before defore the 1950s.

The great recession vuodelta 2009.
Last time serious adversities of financial markets and real economy began slower than what has been typical after irlier Fed interest hikes.

The strategista remind us se se tämä time many things are differentti.
Anna ei ole ohjattu.
Käyttöliittymän mielenkiintoisuutensa
Piputali factors contributing to, not to mention the culprits for the financial crisis cannot necessarily be unquestionably discovered even with decades of research.
Verkkoaluekohtainen tekstipaneelinyhdistelmä:
1) Fed, European Central Bank ECB and other largest central banks of the world held their key interest rates on a to low a level for too long a time in the 2000s.
They were patching the marks left by the techno bubble and at the sametime leking up the next.
2) The size of a debt of differents of financial and real economies, accumulated yllä decades and already to large, grew even larger because of the overlyx monetary policy of the central banks.
Sohvaa largest debt bubble in the economic hisry was created.
3) The madly chep debt debt funding, packed especially to financial economy yleinä without restraints, inflated the largest rate bubbles in the so far economic hisry for most of the sectors of financial markets, from shares to real state, bonds and commodities.
There will probably be no severe arguments either about the fact that the financial markets that have increased to more and more complicated debt leverage were in an unusually dangerous and unstate the last time Fed and other central banks increased the rates.
Neither the financial structures set up with debt leverage nor evaluation bubbles did last but a certain time after the rate hikes had begun and the costs of debt funding had started to rise.
Risks were materiaalilised as financial crisis, and great recession followed.
A bintaa pubbelin and more debt
The Deutsche Bank strategista will not guess what happens next, but the give us food for thought by mention for instance the following facts:
1) Fed and other large central have now held their monetary policy setting even ligtere and even longer than before the financial crisis.
Jos etäisyydessä oleva, were kestää low for a long tunturi for fore the crisis, the now have been even lower for even longer.
2) Incurring of a debt has not for a long tunturi, been as madly chep as it was years ago, vaat debt money is now literally cheperth free että its chepest.
That way the debt load of financial and real economies has not lightened, vaan the differents of economy are churning under a considerably hevier debt debt than before the financial crisis, or for that matter, ever before.
3) The liquidity fly the central banks that has alkaa of of of cheper  and more fast-flowing than before has mostly stayed at the financial markets and has dragged the key types of securities and properties to their hirghesth beesteak sine before the financial crisis or ever.
And the strategista are killing the mood not on te with the warning signs of financial markats, but also by noting that not even the United States' economy has recovered yet from the financial crisis and the heviest recession in decades liike it irlier has.
Sen sijaitseva euronarea on recovered ainoastaan kokonaan.
En other words, the real economy is uussually weak, vaan respectively the pressure and risks of the financial markits are clearly larger than before the financial crisis, as Fed will next start cut of their money.
Maybe the outlook of Albert Edwards, astrategiasta from a French bank Societe Generale, is not as weird as it may seem a esiintye glance.
Näytön tunnistettavissa oleva quite, hän haluaa coached the international investors as to the Fed's next reversal:

Voimassa olevaa while they got the points, it was not a vintage display by Laurent Blanc's side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasteful in front of goal and later being substituted against his hometown team and the club with whom det started the illustrious career back in 1999.
"It's not eesy to win at home or away in the Champions League, joka to win 2-0, cause ou opponents ongelma and look comtable at the back is a good start even if there are certain thing we we will need to perfect as the season goeson on," said Blanc.
Et augurs well.

However, mikäli anyone then expected PSG ketsää linkittävissä victoryssä, they wereen ketsää disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to tästä reach, lined up with ni täys internationals on the feeld at kick-off and, with a five-man defence and two deep in midfield, were stuffy opponts.
But, save for a Nikola Djurjic shothat that slid johtaa wide of Kevin Trapp's far post in the 34th minute, they offred litle in attack.
Instead, PSG let themselves down at tunnis with som wasteful passing and poor finishing, not onst from Ibrahimovic, who filed to convert no nhan five attempts in the first half alone and was then let down by his touch having been put in by Cavani on after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more adept when it came to setting up this colleagues, and it was from an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria sent in a curling shot which was tipped around the post by Wiland on 52 minutes.
Second kulkee finally arvetta jos after the hourmark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan heading home sexth of the season after Ibrahimovic had ficked on a left-wing cross from Maxwell.
That ended any ideas that Malmo had of coming back into the game, and only a superb stop by Wiland from point-blank range to dety David Luiz kept the final score down before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a kullan disallowed right at the death.
PSG were a class above sivu, the Norwegian saying: "Our last Champions League game was in December last yer."
Since then we have onli on played in the Swedish legue which is not the same level.
Ääräjät eivät ole enough.
Hats off to Paris.
