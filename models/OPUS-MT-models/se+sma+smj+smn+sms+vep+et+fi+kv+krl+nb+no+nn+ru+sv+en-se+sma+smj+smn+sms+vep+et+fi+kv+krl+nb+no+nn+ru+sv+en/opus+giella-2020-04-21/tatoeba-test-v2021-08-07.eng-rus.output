Kall White pawn to f3, black pawn to e6, white pawn to g4, black queen to h4 - checkmate! Dette is joking referred to in chess circles as "fool's mate".
Rook on a1, pawn on b6, king on c8. Black: pawns on a7 and b7, king on a8, bishop on b8. White puts the opponent in zugzwang by playing the rook to a6, after which Black has only two options: take the rook on a6 or move his bishop to anther square on the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, White vances his pawn from b6 to b7 and checkmates. In the seconation, the wedit the web blakes on the black pack, twats.

"Zugzwang" is a German word which, with reference to chess, means more or less the following: "obligation toke a move and, consequently, to lose the game".
Zugzwang is a situation in which the obligation toke move a move in one's turn is a serious, ofte decisive, disadvantage.
