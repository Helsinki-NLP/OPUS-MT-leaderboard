Johnny English Strikes Again review - underpowered Rowan Atkinson spy spof
It's traditional now to luo Brexit significances in any new film with a British slant and that does seem applicable to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which startend back in 2003 with Johnny English and spluttered back to life in with Johnny English Reborn.
Will tongue-incheek self-satire on the subject of how obviously rubbish we are be the nation's new export opportunity?
Yhteistyökalut Johnny English has his licence to cock things up renewed for the second time - that name of his signalling more than käyttöhing that is a broad comic creation designed for non-English-aking cinemagoing territories.
He is of course the daft secret agent who despitee tämän biiselle pretensions to smoothie glamour has kut a litle bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of that chap contributing a single note to the Chariots of Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony.
He's also originally based on the traveller and international man of mystery Atkinson on played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leving chaos in this wake.
There kuullaan tätä latista JE outing eli two nice moments
Luvassa Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a mediavalit suit of armour and the rotor blades brefly clanging against his hi hi hiemmist.
Physical comedy is on display, but the humour feels pretty underpowered and weirdly superfluous, especially as the "serious" elokuvan brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
humourin feels if it is pitched at kids rather than adults, and me Johnny English's wacky epärend aren't as inventive and focused as Atkint-movie gags in the persona of Bean.
Is Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker on infiltrated Britain super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identites of all Britain's agents in the field, to the dismay of the agent on duty - a regrettably rool for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last yritys a prime ministeri who is a pompous and embatled figure, already suffering a complete meltdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does hery best with this quasi-Teresa-May charac but there's nothing much in the script to work with.
Tässä kohdassa on intelligence advisers information, as every single active spy has been compromised, she will have to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means bumbling Johnny English himself, now employed as schoomster in kuin posh establishment, vaan giving offf-the-record lessons in how to be an undercover operatiivi: kuten nice gags here, as English offers a School of Rock-type academy of spying.
English is whisked back to Whitehallin for an emergency brefing and reunited with tämän muotolais long-suffering sick Bough, played again Ben Miller.
Henkilökohtaiset, joka ei muodosta amerikkaa, hitched to a summarine commander, a jolly-hockey-sticks role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Secret Service are action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful feem fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime ministeri is falling sengerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims can solve Brita's computer woes: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of farcical highinks: disguised as waiters, they set fire to flash French restaurant; they create mayahem smuggling themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English triggers pure anarchy as attempts to a Virtual Reality headset tomself with the interior of Volta's house.
Alla stops are certainly pulled that last sequence, mutta as amiable and boisterous as its its, there's quite a bit of kids' TV about the whole thing.
Preedin aikakatkaisu.
And as with the other Johnny English films I couldn't help thinking: can'th the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to this talent?
