I like to dance.
It's gonna be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're a lot faster than me.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You look disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you get any sleep?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you get on the exam.
I think two languages are not enough.
Could you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at 3: 00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish is not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student, Jutsu.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is she okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I know where you work?
Can anyone explain this to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I got a promotion recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
Garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary that he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I passed out.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
My phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2: 30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is this?
Tom left his suitcase in the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name is not Kuzay.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie community.
The water's hot.
You need to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today attach more importance to folk culture than to the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you paint your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How was your vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here!
I'll warn you.
I'll try to get them for you.
Who's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom got Mary.
He's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who that is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary took a picture of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It does the same to me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like people.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas's phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The honor was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
She turned 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain has welcomed us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to bring her down with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call this?
Laurie's still in school.
My office is downtown.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We spent three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tiring.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He's fluent in French.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the receipt?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.

We were enemies.
Who's got him?
We have nowhere to go.
How many blocks can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?

I'm the coach.
Tom's gonna be working this afternoon.
Who's that?
Have dinner.
He convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked riddles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom painted the wall pink.
We're very busy.
Louder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe through your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" he cried.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're an easy-to-believe man.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
That was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and I say it again.
Turn on the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
This won't happen again.
Russia is great.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined it.
I'm sorry, I can't stay long.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I pretended to be asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow was making it difficult to see.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.
You can pick any book you want.
Where are your dresses?
Tom's not Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I haven't received an answer in my letter.
Can I borrow your hair dryer?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I read him.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is a Turk.
Can you take out the ten of six?
Don't stop!

He's smart.
When do you go on vacation?
It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.

I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I took it out in tears.
He talks like a trucker.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he's not telling the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined.
It's gonna be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and made me dinner.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
Seven is a lucky number.

They're red.
He said something.
I haven't worked since I got married.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a mare?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm kind of tired myself.
Are you sure you're not imagining things?
Don't apologize.
He walks slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take the blame.
His father's Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm drunk now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like playing the piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.

I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come out.
I wish I was born Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I wasn't part of the conversation.
Be careful: in English we make the nationalities, the days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
You wouldn't go to Australia to build a store?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril; it's nice to meet you!
She has nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sami peed and poked in Lila's bathroom.
When I grow up, I'm gonna be a pilot.

I left for London.
I love dogs.

The birds are red.
Get me a glass.
I need more money.
They all speak French.
Every time I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We were in circles for an hour trying to find the hotel.

It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?

Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given them to Tom yet.
You're still alive.

I get drunk at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.

He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.

Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everybody started running.
When's Tom reading?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it on your own.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You work hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a nice theory, the only disadvantage I think it has is probably common to all philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He's spending a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm really mad right now.
I thought you were Japanese.
It's a lot of noise here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than her.
Please repeat what I say.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of the three.
You asked them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I guess you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.

What?
Where did you get the key?
Can this not be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, call me tonight.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me what you think.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.

Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.

Where can I buy tickets?
I was very hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.

I brought you something.
I pretended to be asleep.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was impressive.
Mary's very cautious about strangers.
We'll shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Slow down.
Put the book on the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married a Canadian.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Are you texting them?

We only have three options.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.

I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
French is not difficult.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where do you swim?
His hair was brown.
He keeps repeating the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Stephen's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Are they Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
How long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay still.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before dark.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write a story.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
My father's not here.
Wait, there's something I want to tell you.
He's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa before.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who did Tom sell his car to?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first I couldn't understand it.

My girlfriend's Canadian.
If I wasn't broke, I'd buy it.
Wait for us here.
"Do you speak English?" - "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to eat shrimp?
I have a friend.
She didn't get Mary's joke.
Are you going to tell them?
She's very slippery.
Who brought you here?
We had our vacation at the lake.
Who closed the door?

Take my wife.
Hang your clothes here.

You have no manners.
Why are you smiling?
Didn't I tell you not to close the door?
Please don't touch me.
I got you a present.
You're not poor.
We're going to visit Tom.
My colleague and I are doing the same job, but they promised him a promotion very soon.
Does she like oranges?
Are you mad at me?
You have to write a letter.
Tell her I'm ready.
I'll do the dishes.
I like the snow.
Tom saw Mary today.
I was born in Boston.
They believe me.
You killed her.
They'll find her.
I don't care about modern art.
We murdered them.
You're so handsome!
Tom's famous.
Tom says he needs help.
Why did you shoot them?
It took a lot longer than I thought.
Who was right?
I want to watch TV.
I got him down.
Speak French.
She's married to a dentist.
We're still in shock.

We don't want it.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you talking about?
Someone's singing.
How many springrolls did you eat?
The flower is blue.
I like this room.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
Who is this girl?
Ignore them.
It's the hero.
I didn't eat it.
Our store is not open.
You underestimated them.
Throw her out.
Tom stole Mary's computer.
Those candles aren't white.
The man they're talking about has been dead for a long time.
Tom and Mary didn't agree on anything.
I'm diabetic.
He's kicking me!
When was the last time you smoked?
We all agreed with Tom.
Tom's house is near the beach.
We're going to build a wall.
This tea is good.
This is the last warning.
Give us three minutes.
You'll learn to speak English fluently!
Fantastic!
Say it in Hungarian!
I know his address.
I want to know when the meeting starts.
I know he's lying.
Actually, you're absolutely right.
Do you like white chocolate?
The snakes are reptiles.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
I would like to visit the ancient Athens.
This rope is too strong.
You'll be busy, Ares.
Can you give me a better explanation?
Can you see the stars tonight?
Ask him when the next plane leaves.
You're vivid.
Look around.
Tom said he knew Mary's secret.
That's the absolute truth.
He admitted it?
I paid someone to clean up my house.
I'll cook you something.
We found them.

They didn't understand the question.

They need you.
How old are your brothers?
Tom bought Mary a car.
It's almost summer.
I guessed right.
Tom studied in Boston.
I'll show you.
He wants to live in the city.
I'll never see you again.
From now on you'll have to read more.
I've never had that kind of problem.
Did we win?
I'm not very good at this.
Were you alone?
I don't blame anyone.
I missed Tom.
I have to go to bed.
Tom hasn't called yet.

I'm proud of my brother.
I can't believe what Tom says.
Are we leaving now?
You'll find out.
I want to see them again.

You're older than me.
We're doctors.
You think you could help me get the weeds out of the garden this afternoon?
Is Tom hungry?
I'm ready to go.
Who died?
Tom runs every day.
Tom couldn't understand why Mary had made that decision.
You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
Right.
We're being honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we'll be ready.
Who taught you French?
Tom had a black cat.
I'll buy one.
Tom would never have done that.
Tom lit three candles.
We're gonna get killed.
Are you texting him?
I'll show you the city.
I want to close the door.
Why did you do that?
It's gone in the woods.
How far is it from Brno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's a cop, isn't he?
What are you eating today?
Tom's Canadian.
Did you kiss?
We've been warned.
Tom's got a lot of brains.
Wait here.
In his eyes, it was perfect.
Can you find him?
He's strong, brave and, above all, kind.
They're Canadian, aren't they?
I'll teach you French.
Tom sings pretty good.
I was tired.
You were perfect.
Tell him it's important.
Why exactly did you do that?
I'm eating.
Try to stay still.
I admire you.

This is my best friend.
Let's talk about it.
Your father won't buy it.

Why don't you tell them?
Is she asleep?
Where's the school?
I'm not interested in politics.
Are you crazy?
I'm very tired.
What do you want me to do?
Do you understand them?
Tom has never used the Internet.
When did you start using contact lenses?

I'm going home today.
I have sunglasses.
We have the best food in town.

Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.

Are you sure you hit the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.

We're all Canadian here.
Here's how he snore.
Did Tom send you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is that word pronounced?
He saved me.
I got an idea.

It's almost 2: 30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.

He's in front of the door.
I think they go to Australia just to have fun.
Tom's cheeks are blushing.
I'm Richard.
What did you open it with?
Would you like a reservation on a trip to Australia?

We've prepared well.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like to put me to bed, don't you?
Is it raining?
He's very slippery.
They'll hear us.

Life is short, although the smile only lasts a second.
Now I know the truth.
