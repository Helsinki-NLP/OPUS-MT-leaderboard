The Prague Stock Exchange at the end of the trade was reduced
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the morning crash.
Transactions in shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) reached almost half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday immediately from the beginning of the Tuesday trade, when it fell almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the fall.
This is how the market reacts to the outcome of the vote of the US House of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Share fall in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday, although some of the losses were finally cancelled during the day.
The Hong Kong Hang Seng stock exchange index described almost four percent in the course of trading, but later it deleted some of the losses and reduced the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
On the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, the Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, monitoring Chinese stocks, fell 3.8 percent, and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The shares in the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses dropped to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese stock market dropped 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
"The timing of the American rescue mission is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," noted Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its financial policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should start negotiations immediately and accept the financial system's proposal for support.
Otherwise, there is a threat that other countries will feel the consequences of this.
The Bloodbath of American Shares
On Monday, the U.S. House rejected the draft financial support, which should have spent $700 billion (almost 12 trillion kroner).
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, the US shares suffered a bloodbath and the leading stock indices recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, with a similar rate of fall last year in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index started to fall free.
Congress withdrew: The U.S. government will be able to pump $700 billion into banks
The chief leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system.
This will be voted on early next week.
The US legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system in the amount of 700 billion dollars (approximately 12 trillion kroner).
But there's no victory yet.
The convention must complete some details of the agreement before they can disclose the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial support will be discussed in the House of Representatives on Monday.
That's what the Reuters news agency was briefed on Sunday by Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee on Finance.
According to Senate sources, the draft may probably be voted on on Wednesday as soon as possible.
Economists believe that there should be an announcement that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the revival of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "well-being" will then take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have resolved our different views on what the form of the package for stabilising the market should be like," said the Bloomberg agency, the Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
He said the final vote could take place on Sunday.
The legislators met Henry Paulson, the US finance minister, on Saturday night to give the government a final form.
This should buy from financial companies the unselling mortgage assets that bring financial firms into serious losses and endanger the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to a final agreement on a draft that will work and which should also be effective on the market.
The plan for correction still needs to be continued, but I think we're there," said Paulson.
Signpost to Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the legislators are therefore seeking a permanent settlement in Congress on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before trading on the Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress's decision could be the first to influence Monday's trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress are voting on the law, and neither is it possible that the trial cannot be blocked at the last minute because of any problem.
The legislators hope that the law will be approved in the following days.
However, the law is still undergoing a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the scheme shall be divided into two parts.
At the request of President George Bush, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at an additional $100 billion and later $350 billion if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function.
Bush evaluated progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this decision, the Congress may override its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme remained, which was to acquire financial assets for the acquisition of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We worked everything out.
The House should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
With the progress made in the negotiations, President Bush of the United States is pleased.
Tony Fratto, Bush's spokesperson, stated that the president was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bipartisan efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy. "
Restricting the Busy Endorsements
The chairman of the Senate Bank Committee, Christopher Dodd, who led the negotiations, said that the legislators had agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the draft funding.
The new law also limits the so-called "busy severance payments" of the directors participating in the programme and establishes a committee for monitoring the fund.
The fund should be run by the Treasury Department.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayments for the mortgages it purchases with a view to reducing the monthly repayments of debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Soul Aid
The proposed proposal is a good idea, according to David Marek, the chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"All this is because it is not possible to know what mechanism and at what price problematic assets will be bought up.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government distribute losses among themselves," said Marek to the iHNed.cz website this week.
According to Marek, it's not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is much more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of agreeing that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment," stressed Marek.
A few fights on the edge: MP3 players versus cell phones.
Helping to Choose
While almost all mobiles can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
It makes sense that it's better to just buy phones.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get a high-end record player at home to listen to the newest Maxim Turbulenc record.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl plates, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if his shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl records, he probably dreams of such a record player.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some it may be unacceptable to rent 8,000 crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan may find it difficult to accept a market headphone with 20 crowns.
There are two extremes between which everyone has enough space.
There's a wide selection.
The life of the elements also counts
Some high-end music players can do much more than simply play music, but also what most mobiles do not happen to do.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to the primary features, phone calls and text messages, you can play music and videos, record both, have a right-worst camera, and even navigate.
And if you consider the smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no fridge can barbecue and no television can take pictures.
Multiple-function cell phones have drawbacks.
The more features you use on your mobile, the more the display sends you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy eaters.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
That's why with cheap cell phones, count on them not to play for you for more than a few hours.
If you even make a phone call here and there, get a charger for your workplace just in case - this also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such problems, even worse ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one upload.
The next problem arises when the music is uploaded to a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices have a universal USB connector and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but few card readers can cope without adapters with miniature memory cards used in mobile phones.
With a few exceptions (iPod) players do not need any special software.
It's enough to fill the device from the computer with music through USB.
The majority of mobiles and players are already creating a musical library in order based on the name of the performer, the album, the genre, or for example the user's evaluation.
Some devices represent only tree structures like Windows Explorer, and know some of them both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
When selecting the specific equipment, please check the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of the treatment.
If music serves as a background for you and only listens to it for a short time a day, for example on the tram, any mobile that plays MP3 will suit you.
And any cell phone can do that now.
You don't even have to pay particular attention to the music formats that the mobile or player can use.
MP3 can handle all of them and the vast majority of the music you receive will be in this format.
MP3 is one of the most common and the vast majority of devices can also cope with WMA format music.
AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less common.
Better mobiles also allow, for example, online music shopping.
It is enough to visit the appropriate pages of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile internet and to buy the song or album.
This service can in itself be a strong argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of service providers is lousy and usually limited to one-year radio hits.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that such a way of selling music (either via GSM, Internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you feel your cell phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your speakerphones.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost all mobile players have, but only a few MP3 players.
For many, the biggest advantage of music mobiles is the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of traditional earphone output.
The best and most technically equipped phones can cost up to fifteen thousand kroner with traditional 3.5 mm diameter headphones.
However, the advantage of players is, among other things, simple handling.
The simplest - by no means necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) can really be handled by everyone.
Minimal function, the treatment similar to the previous standard cassette tape recorder or gramophone is obvious.
There is no risk of collapse in the form of an accidentally switched-on mobile internet or in the case of a huge bill for the subsequent transmission of data.
What device to choose
The cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have an opening to replace memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
Buying the right card will fit up to 2,000 kroner.
But be careful.
The basic types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive can do with up to 8 GB of memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and even want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If it belongs to more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson was the biggest player in the sector, which has the same user interface as the individual MP3 players sold.
MP3 players in the above mentioned brands can offer the same service in the same price category up to four thousand kroner, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively developed and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, we are missing something here - a virtual provider that forces classic service providers to reduce their prices substantially.
Maybe it won't be for long.
On the Mobil.cz website we have often said that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is more expensive than that of other EU countries.
Following the recent action of the European Commission, the regulation of roaming charges may result in a conflicting situation - some of the Czech mobile operators' customers' text messages from abroad will be cheaper than domestic ones.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, since we have three mobile networks and our penetration is high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has often agreed on this, who has said a few times that there is no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider with its own network is no longer likely to have too much of a chance (though it would probably be difficult to find a frequency).
But there is one other option - the virtual service provider.
Just as virtual service providers entered the mobile market, significant price reductions were made, and then classic service providers had to respond to them.
In the meantime, even before big fish like Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile were on the market in Britain, voices like ours were heard.
However, it has been proven that such providers have a place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we do not have to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the launch of the mobile virtual service provider in Poland.
This service provider managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers in less than six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
In the meantime, Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which in the Czech Republic is also owned by U:fon.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to be efficient, it needs much less customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not entail relatively high costs for building, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers generally appear in the world at low cost - offering cheap calls and text messages, which are often offset by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper text messages than its competitors.
But, as the example of Mobile in Poland shows, it is a pretty good move to bet on a target group.
This service provider focuses specifically on men.
"The real men choose the Mobilking service provider - who they like, whom they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of this virtual service provider Mobil Entertainment Company.
It is difficult to say whether the idea like that in Poland can work for us.
Miroslav Čepický, Vodafone spokesperson, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small to the segment approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied with regard to the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic, there is no chance, mobile operators claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem very hopeful.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our region," said Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta Financial Group in his telephone interview to Mobil.cz.
This indirectly demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do their best to ensure that no potential competition can be created.
For some time, the GTS Novera Group has not been hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider, which aims to take another step to make Telefonica O2 a real competitor in the field of corporate customers.
"We are very interested to be able to provide not only landline but also mobile telecommunications services to our customers.
And the sooner the better.
This option has been renegotiated with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations," says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson for the group.
Maybe now's a better time.
From informal information, it seems that the first virtual service provider will be lucky by the end of the year.
His birth, however, is now surrounded by an impenetrable silence.
"At this moment, we do not think that a full-fledged virtual service provider should have a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very special.
So far, we have not been approached by a single subject, which offers a complex and serious project in this area," he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the press department of Telefónica 02, Vlastimil Sršeň.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by the other operators.
Martina Kemrová, spokesperson for T-Mobile, adds, exceptionally in agreement with O2, that "Until now we have not recorded any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects on which to base further."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
At this moment, we should have a specific agreement on our table so that we can think in such a short term."
Vodafone prefers to pay attention to its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of sharing costs and infrastructure.
That's what we consider the most rewarding from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find partners to build networks shared with fast mobile internet."
Responsible offices - in a string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of a new operator would mean an increase in competition, leading to a fall in prices and thus to a decrease in profits.
So why make it easy for such a competition to enter?
When service providers have something important, they are able to cooperate, they also testify to the long haul around the birth of U:fon.
The highest pressure on ČTÚ was probably around the birth of the U:phone of the T-Mobile company.
This is demonstrated by publicly available information on ČTÚ's website.
But right now, U:fon is a good reason why we should not allow the virtual service provider to enter.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been eroded by the market access of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that another player's entry into the market and services would be subject to high requirements."
However, given this attitude of mobile operators, the total lack of interest of Czech regulators is absolutely astonishing.
Meanwhile, it is not just ČTÚ's attitude, which in the Czech Republic, unfortunately, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries, has no right to intervene in economic competition.
Only the Hungarian Competition Authority is entitled to do so.
But the office has a distinctive attitude to the whole problem.
"The virtual service provider's entry into the mobile market would only be possible after a contract between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider is concluded on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the supply of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers," he said in response to our question about Kristian Chlapua, the External Relations Department of the Hungarian Competition Authority.
A statement from representatives of service providers thus formulated would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office which should represent the interests of consumers and, above all, ensure that no one can abuse their market situation, this is more than odd.
Especially if Kristian Chalupa adds: "Outland, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a decrease in the price of mobile phone services."
However, the interests of the ÚOHS are probably not to put pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the price reduction.
In this case, it is indeed shocking to find a quite touching consistency from the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question is whether it's really a coincidence, it's almost self-evident.
Just as the petrol prices at the filling stations are certainly just the work of chance and tough competition.
"The Office has not discovered any evidence of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so it has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the service providers has a leading position, i.e. a correspondingly higher responsibility for their market activities.
The tools needed to open up the mobile market for virtual service providers are probably also missing the telecom regulator," said Chalupa.
The presentation of the market leader position is one of the many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTÚ on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position in such a market.
However, some legal experts offer a different approach - the virtual service provider always requires the approval of the network operator.
And the mobile operator, relatively logically speaking, has a monopoly on its own network.
So, in a particular segment, it is necessarily dominant.
But even if this argument were not accepted, it should be a minimum warning for UOHS that three mobile operators act in the same way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including the already mentioned company GTS Novera) show that they encounter very similar obstacles in the course of negotiations with all service providers.
Placing responsibility on ČTÚ is a relatively common trick in telecommunications, with which the UOHS takes its hand off the whole case.
We've seen this before in some similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the expansion of ČTÚ's powers in the field of economic competition could not be carried through telecommunications, although many experts hoped to improve the situation.
The representatives of the UOHS need to know that, but their interests are probably different.
This works when no one's watching.
In the meantime, the operation of some kind of false virtual service provider remains undetected, many of which are already operational in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own mobile phone service price lists, but they are only partially public.
They are multilevel marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company client against the service provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a top client, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-emptions.
"If there were cases that he was talking about, the terms of the contract could be an infringement that we would be dealing with and which could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with the company in question," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this problem.
But it is highly unlikely that the news of this type of activity has not reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, thousands of customers may be involved in the three companies mentioned.
In the meantime, no service provider defends itself against such a procedure.
These companies have not had negligible profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual service providers, they do not threaten them with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not in their name on their phones, so they cannot have this in full as general customers of mobile operators."
But that's what ČTÚ should be strange about.
In addition, there is another question for the UOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to similar procedures, why do they prevent the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that the UOHS has a relatively strong power to expose such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they did not suspect any such thing and that their commercial terms prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has led to a noticeable decrease in the price of services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers are established, classic service providers have tried to prevent their creation more or less.
The arguments they used were virtually the same - too small, perhaps too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in developed countries, regulatory bodies intervened at precisely these moments, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but of their customers.
Then, either through formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider that others had followed.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are handing the whole thing to each other.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that unclear competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming soon, the Czech mobile market may be back on the move.
If a service provider would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, it would be difficult for the UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And perhaps we will no longer make more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on Czech State Day presented the new recordings of the State Anthem Where Is My Country?
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra led by Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo, choir or instrumental.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka sing.
The anthem was modified by the authors of Otakar Jeremiaš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had already told Czech Radio that he deliberately selected young representative singers who were expressive and popular for singing solo variations.
"From the beginning, I have tried to ensure a clear diction, a clear understanding of the text and consistency at both and later in the orchestra," he said.
The Czech state anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where Is My Country? was first performed in the Order Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajtan's Tyl Fidlovačka, accompanied by the music of František Škroup.
It became popular, and people spontaneously viewed it as their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, it remained one of the seven state symbols.
How's the "new" anthem?
The transport company in Prague will deliver with a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday 1 October 2008 enters the history of the Transport Company in Prague as the first passenger to enter metros, trams and buses to have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line ticket.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30 days and 90 days and annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time save them to their chip cards at the Metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraži Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, coupons can be purchased via the Internet via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz website.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until the afternoon.
Those who start using Internet commerce can permanently forget about the subway stations' publishing windows, where they have had to regularly stand up long lines for the bar tickets.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card will be saved in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained servers who help interested people buy online and save their purchased coupons for their cards," said Martin Opatrný, the project spokesperson.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons can be saved for Opencard in the self-service vending machines installed in some lobbys.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, reminding me of ticket managers, and the passengers may already have noticed them at the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are currently five of them in town, but they should be 80 by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon is automatically checked instead of the driver
The operation of the machines starting tomorrow is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card and a previously paid coupon will be saved by itself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will be valid not only in the capital but also in the area.
So on the trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, with which the inhabitants of the Central Czech districts travel to the capital.
"On trains classified in Prague's integrated transport, the guides were provided with card readers to identify the area validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal from the Ropid organization, which established the timetable for public transport in Prague.
In the busses around the city, card readers are installed at the cashier's office.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place Opencard on the cashier's side.
That's how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of coupons, it is the easiest way to ask the driver to do so," he added Dráp.
Passengers who do not drive buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon expires may again go to self-service vending machines that save coupons on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
Sudetas wanted a referendum from the U.S.
In 1945, the Sudeta Germans asked for the addition of Šumava to the United States.
This comes from the letter in the collection of the Southern Czech Science Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the cartridge of the United States of America.
It was said that some groups of Sudeta Germans turned to the President of the United States in 1945 with this wish.
This can also be seen from a private archive that is preserved today in the collection of the Southern Czech Science Library.
In the letter from Česky Krumlov, the Germans asked the President of the United States not to allow the "šumava County" to be returned to the Czech Republic, which was occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"The situation has been correctly understood and we really want to be sure of the words that American troops are in no way coming to the German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," there is in the letter, signed with the words "People who care about Šumava's fate."
Since the addition to Czechoslovakia to the Sudeta Germans is supposed to give only hope of brutality, mercilessness, not understanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the US President to take over the Protectorate "now and forever" over Šumava.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, he would condemn this area to a foreign country, which would oppress and destroy the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the Allies," says the letter.
The reason why the authors couldn't sign is said to be a fear of revenge for the "Czech oppressors."
So if the President of the United States were supposed to doubt the opinion of the Germans in Šumava, it would be enough for him to make a reference in the region of Šumava whether his people would want to become part of the US and live under the US's patronage.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive with the current knowledge of postwar history, some historians say that it correctly depicts the expectations of the Sudeta Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that they were being deported from the country, only a few of them acknowledged this possibility.
Some expected the United States and the Great Britain to agree on a form of autonomy for the Sudetas.
Others hoped that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice during the war.
When, at the end of the war, the British captured them and threw them into the Holštynsko prison camp, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them Czech.
"They hoped that when they returned home, they could use the Czech language," said Chalupa.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war had calculated that they would be deported from the country on the basis of Beneš decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history for road safety.
Thus, the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday would be characterised.
The Minister's Office of Aleš řebíček hopes that this campaign will deter leaders from dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The campaign for 150 million will be on television, radio, cinema, internet, but also on leaflets.
Leaders should be dissuaded from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seat belts before they leave.
In particular, young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, not least, the conscience of professional drivers.
And what appears in the commercials?
Emotional, primarily human stories.
That's what the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan says:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" on the license plate is written in big letters.
And in the pool of blood, there's the word "pay."
This should symbolize that a man can pay with his life for a moment of carelessness.
The viewers are being "scared" by the advertising spots until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
It is hoped that the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads will be reduced.
The advertising spots were made by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, let the drivers
"The driver's system 'pull it, let it' applies.
For them, 'sustain' is when, for example, they pass the red light, saving time.
"Pull" is the danger of punishment or accident.
The driver needs to be reminded of the risk," says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, the psychologist believes.
He thinks the driver's attention is less effective than the signs calling for danger.
"If the danger warning board is fitted, it will probably merge quickly with the environment and the leaders will not deal with it," he warned Kořán.
Olmer would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Government of Israel, spoke about the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, i.e. Jordan's western coast, East Jerusalem and the Golan plateau, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said that in an interview that Jediot Achronot published daily on Monday.
"We must agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all of them, if not all the (occupied) areas, must be returned," he told the newspaper.
"We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because without them there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem, and in particular does not want tractors and bulldozers to cross his legs, as it happened to one of my best friends, must give up part of Jerusalem," noted Olmer, referring to the attack on two cities in July, in which some people were killed and a few dozen injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution to the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places" in Old Town.
"The person who wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It's not gonna work," he said.
Exodus from the Golan plateau
Olmert also gave an opinion on the Israelis' withdrawal from the Golan plateau, which he considered to be an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they have to give up to get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they must give up their regular support to the terrorism of Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," the Prime Minister explained.
Questions after an accident: Are flight attendants in buses illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you shouldn't walk in a bus
In connection with the tragic bus accident of Student Agency in Padova, Italy, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could travel in the bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the flight attendant's activities are inconsistent with the Transport Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22 - year - old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus.
Unfortunately for the girl, at that moment she was sitting next to the driver, at the least safe place on the bus, even though there were two more seats reserved for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake the moment the flight attendant serves coffee or offers a newspaper.
There is a role in whether the bus has a standing position according to the registration certificate.
If the bus is not homologised, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have standing places; this was confirmed by Radim Jančura, the company's manager, to Aktuálně.cz.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and initially passengers were not allowed to move.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have concluded that passengers can go to a toilet during the journey, if they have their own seats," he said.
The law doesn't know the flight attendant
"There is no clear legal division on the role of flight attendant - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier is not prohibited by any legislation from providing services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle attendant; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds spokesperson Hanzelka less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Operations Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers that the law is handling the problem properly.
"It depends on whether or not the bus has a standing space in its registration permit.
And that's the end of it," say.
Busses may be urban, where there are standing places and have a limited maximum speed, with standing places between cities and an authorised higher speed, as well as long-distance seats without standing places and at the maximum authorised speed with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
Jaroslav Hořín, transport safety expert at BESIP, sees no fundamental problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"There is not much danger in continuing progress, and the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
We're not even sure when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"But if the bus suddenly braked, its physical laws would, of course, apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of flight attendants must be resolved by internal rules by the carrier," he says, and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
The Student Agency offers cabin crew services as the sole bus carrier.
He employs 200 flight attendants.
The director doesn't consider their profession risky after the accident.
"But as I get the impression that the flight attendants' occupation is risky, I will eliminate it.
Coffee and newspapers are available for passengers when boarding.
It would also save costs," he says.
In its vehicles, the absence of flight attendants was justified by security interests by Alexei Litvin, Director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of flights compared to the Student Agency.
"We don't have flight attendants, we've been against this since the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some sort of fatal injury," he said to Týden.cz just a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy.
The young flight attendant from Plzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably turned out of the stopping lane without using a direction indicator and blocked the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to escape with a sudden maneuver, but the right front of the bus hit him.
Jančura refused to sell two reserved spaces for the rest of the flight attendants.
"These seats are not reserved or blocked for long-distance flights."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
By compensating the girl's family, the agency does not wait for the court's judgment, but also expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
A law amendment?
In the distant future
Clarification of the movement of flight attendants on board the bus could be reported by the amendment of the law, on which the 30-person expert group of the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year.
"However, the group did not obtain any concrete results.
The busses are not so much, but the point system deals with the maximum speed allowed on the motorway and mobile use while driving," says Hořín, an expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," spokesperson Hanzelka concludes that the control of the safety of buses falls within the competence of police and employment offices.
The hopes of Düsseldorf depend on Frankfurt
The letter from WestLB's board of directors to the staff of the bank is not lacking in big words.
The merger between the units of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Deka-Bank in Frankfurt could create "the central capital market organisation of the savings bank group," says the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a persistently profitable "competence block" into such a business.
Such a relationship could give a decisive boost to further mergers in the provincial banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove its capacity in difficult times.
After all, the unstable WestLB bank is still under enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that it is on the verge of finding a lasting solution.
For savings bank customers, however, the issue of a kind of relationship between Deka-Bank and WestLB on the basis of the investment fund has been a long time.
Franz Waas, head of Deka-Bank, informed at the end of August that the merger between the bank at Mainzer Landstraß and a provincial bank, such as Heliba or WestLB, did not make any sense.
Despite this, the Board of Directors of Deka, one half of which is represented by the provincial banks and the other half by the savings bank associations, instructed the board to negotiate joint business activities with WestLB.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts of it.
However, the negotiations, they claim, have only just begun.
With 3000 employees, the name of Deka-Bank, one of the major employers of the financial sector in Frankfurt, is not the first to come up with a consolidation of the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
Yet, this threefold covenant did not become anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessian Provincial Government spoke against the interest of Helaba.
After that, the other two banks couldn't find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka-Bank and the provincial banks has been raised over and over again.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heliba, spoke out against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, the need to approach the various banks of the public sector is recognised.
Following the regional assembly elections in Bavaria, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected for the first time.
It's not necessarily good news for Heliba.
If the pressure for further fusion increases, the potential partners may slowly run out.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger partner, although the financial crisis has so far survived significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was ruled out by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85% stake in Helaba, at the beginning of the year.
The NordLB stays better off.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, there is a question of how different business models of individual banks match.
Merl stated in June that the German Savings Bank and Fat Association had not yet answered the decisive question of what business model should be used to ensure the future of the provincial banks.
Finally, it is still possible to cut up WestLB, which they obviously do not want there.
Thus, the letter from the Board of Directors there also states that they are in any event seeking a "complete solution."
How this is compatible with the union of individual units with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's Elena's first, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is completely different, says Luca.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser-brand five-litre barrel, there is a man with a strong beard, and he insists that some 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest can draw out deep sounds from his throat.
Elena's gonna lick Luca's face first, then kiss her.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking lot near Puorta Nuova station, four buses depart at 23.45 p.m. for "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra," arrival is expected at 6:30 p.m.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were singing next to their flag, and they started celebrating the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, who wears long, artificial fur coats and wide, silvery-legged glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years, he's only organized three trips this year.
At night, at Oktoberfest during the day, at 22.30 a.m.
Accommodation would be an unnecessary expense, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, which includes welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German-language guide, cooked according to Bavarian beer purity law - Marco took a German language course in Frankfurt.
And now the buses are throwing themselves into the night on the freeway towards "Brennero."
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
It's okay, they're gonna need their strength.
They take a break in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where a number of Italian buses take a short break before Munich on highway 8.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30, according to the plan, there are nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's holding one last briefing, presenting the battle plan.
First, everyone put on the yellow hat.
On the left of this, the word "Octoberfest" is written in fractal letters, followed by Marco's travel agency's Internet address: "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second, "When the doors of the beer tent open, run," says Marco in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not in advance, because we're stuck, and let's not sit on the same benches with all the yellow hats, but spread out in the tent."
The one-litre jug costs 8.25 euros, he yells at Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you've been doing well.
As soon as you leave your post, they'll be taken!"
Third, "You'll be back tonight at 10:30 sharp." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wies.
On the way, one man ties yellow hats to trees, signs, and even the electoral posters of one of the major Bavarian people.
We must prepare to retreat.
This is Oktoberfest's second weekend, known as the Italian weekend.
There are no precise figures; there are 50,000 people who cross the Alps in the beer tents, supposedly ten percent of all visitors of the weekend arrive from Italy.
The Munich police force is strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, and Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross, whose national statistics include some 200 medical supplies, and the Italians take the first place, preventing the Austrians (about 80) and the British who are on the lowest level of the podium (about 60).
The Hofbräu beer tent is especially popular among the Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressing Peer Steinbrück Federal Finance Minister only last week.
It is fortunate that the politician used the word 'normally', and he added that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
'Cause that's what happened this weekend.
The property financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in Munich, Daxon, received a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to defend itself against market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knew the situation informed Reuters that the loan subsidies amounted to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes from partly private and partly public banks.
The losses of the Depfa subsidiary are in the background.
According to a newspaper report, the Depfa, which provides state funding, has lent money to long-term projects and has refinanced itself to a very short maturity - which is now not possible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve fell by 95 percent to EUR 2,37 million and the equity ratio declined moderately from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, revenues from credit credits and specific securities and the liquidation of the provisions of the credit business fell to EUR 5 million with a decrease of more than 70 per cent.
Only because of the higher revenue generated by the reimbursement of the ex post clearing costs of the conversion of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the levy regulation and the business made to companies belonging to the group, there was a relatively moderate revenue deficit of 16%.
After privatisation in 1990, the former state financer first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later separated from Aeral Bank.
As the classic state funding was low, Depfa made a stronger contribution to infrastructure projects and to joint projects between private investors and the state (private-public partnership, PPP) and expanded its activities internationally.
Hypo Real Estate should now provide descriptions of the value of the subsidiaries that have a "essential effect' on the group's profit and loss account, they have said quite generally.
In fact, no dividend payment was made.
The dividend was reduced to a third by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major funder of state and infrastructure since Depfa was adopted.
It is more dependent on inter-bank market refinancing than on other financial institutions, since it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the banks' lending to each other has subsided, as banks hold their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets each year to refinance part of Depfa's loan portfolio, some EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered for the foreseeable duration of the loan and the company is protected from "the influence of the international financial markets which are currently largely inoperable'.
Other sources say that, thanks to the money, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009.
On the other hand, Georg Funke, Chairman of the Board of Directors of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not use the financial markets for a foreseeable period of time.
The Federal Bank of Germany and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate group is now ensured.
This gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and incalculability of the crisis, they cannot be certain.
It is not even unthinkable that there is no need to make full use of the funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After Saturday's late-night news said the bank was on the verge of bankruptcy, the temporary rescue of the bank could not calm things down.
The share price decreased by 75 percent to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond exchange rates are quite well maintained.
While the first-ranking debt has hardly changed, the exchange rates of the subordinated bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis concerns bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, as far as is possible, maturity over 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds seemed to be a speculative investment alternative, their value should now be seen as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the sharpening of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution, taking over the Depfa, has brought the crisis to home.
As long as central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to start by paying benefits on time.
Or it will happen, which at present almost no one dares to hope to overcome the financial crisis in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports on partial nationalisation, the likelihood of certainty has now become purely legitimate.
For long-term creditors, the decision to give up their investment can lead to sleepless nights.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to provide a reserve for the taxes payable on the exchange rate gains over the coming years.
The Secrets of Sylvana and the Insulator Box
When the 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop has to introduce himself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start to giggle: The German chick is totally "kawai"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - in the new student blog she tells about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was so excited.
I was scared on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavasaki, and travel 40 minutes by train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, and fortunately I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start ringing from eight o'clock until a brief conversation with the teacher, "home room," starts at 8:40.
But before I started teaching, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type of person who likes to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have my school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my hostess, a blouse, blue knee tights, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the cathedral in this outfit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sajonara, vo se Sylvana... - My name is Sylvana, I am from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language for quite two years.
All 31 girls were whispering and giggling and waving, and I couldn't stop hearing the word "kavai."
I knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the Japanese girls' basic vocabulary, and it means "cute, sweet."
Then I took my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me smiled wide, and felt honored to be seated next to the exchange student.
The rest of the watch was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran right in.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions they drilled a hole in my stomach - even though it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
After the break, everyone unpacked their insides.
My host has also prepared such a lunch for me - this is completely different from the boring German brunch sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, cucumber and algae salad, fruit, and a kind of tofu-wrapped meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks weird, and it tastes brand-new.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, maybe except for the salt plums, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, the inside is not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl gives a boy a self - made bento, especially artistically compiled, in the hope of getting to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
"Why Japan?" asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm simply fascinated."
After all, I've wanted to read mangas for years.
And to better understand the comic books and the culture they describe, at some point I started learning Japanese.
It was clear to me, then, that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're very precious here.
Japan, on the one hand, is a country of latest techniques and trends - and on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen."
Rats have feelings, too.
A rat or a moth is on the run.
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals also have emotions.
But how can we examine whether they feel the same way when they act like us?
For years, famous scientists have been publishing their articles in the "Edge" Internet magazine.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in one of its series is looking at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without proving it?"
I believe that animals have emotions and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as we examine other species and dissect questions of perception or consciousness in general, we come to difficult terrain, because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals, pretending to be dead, fleeing or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, suggesting that some researchers have comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our own subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation/management functions).
This broad area is more advanced in humans than in other primates, and it seems that other organisms are completely absent.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, for example, the consciousness of who we are, or in the case of planning and decision-making ability, it is reasonable to assume that man is different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often claimed that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, the animals may be excluded.
However, even if the language was not dependent on the language, the language would certainly affect it, so the animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what consciousness might be in the case of other animals.
If the mind cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware, it cannot be analyzed based on our own experience, then its research will cause us serious problems.
Most of my discussions relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness, which is probably more accessible to science.
The animal's conscious processes could be examined regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the case of experiments on the short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
However, in this assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural contexts of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both can be the same, whether or not.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also highlights the importance of prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualization.
What follows from this emotion?
I point out that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in a brain that is aware of its own activities.
What we call "fear" is, therefore, the mental state in which we are when the activity of the defence system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) occupies a work memory.
Thus, emotions are closely linked to those areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
In addition to language, perception is divided into subtle degrees, because with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorize states so that we can describe them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the areas of the brain cortex and brain stem body perception, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed very much in human evolution, it can easily play a role in species-wide emotions.
In theory, I can't deny that, but I find it unproveable.
Pankseep believes that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to feel in both cases: How can it be checked whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave alike?
A cockroach flees in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet proof of the same experience.
Although neural comparison further helps: rats and humans have similar brain stem, cockroaches do not have brains.
But the brain stem is responsible for the emotions?
And even if it could be proved for humans, how can we prove that for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but even cockroaches (who knows) have feelings.
However, I do not know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are suspected to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is promising on the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
As with rats, I don't research language and consciousness, I don't research emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem like a shortsighted attitude to others, but I prefer to move forward rather than constantly bump into a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister of Ukraine Ivan Vasjunik said that the preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees confidence in Ukraine in the decision of UEFA Bordeaux and the belief that Ukraine can organise the European Championship together with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"But this does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and much remains to be done in both countries."
Both host countries are lagging behind in the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
The number of EB stadiums may be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We have to work at peak speed now," said Grigory Surkis, President of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they were destined to take even more radical action.
Following numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish Association of PZPN, which was replaced by independent Inspector Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission met on the initiative of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki Minister for Sport.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN cannot operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have assured Michel Platini, President of UEFA, that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
In the last season alone, several first league teams had to be classified as lower class because of manipulation and eventually the ligastar had to be postponed.
Infuriated Dennis Quaid strikes back
The actress wanted to promote a new movie, she talked about her personal life in the interview, and now she's got a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan's Hollywood star has declared her ex-husband Dennis Quaid an adulterer.
♪ Who's got a temper ♪ ♪ and he's got a fightback ♪
The war of late roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-husband: The two Hollywood actors are fighting ugly battles seven years after their divorce - in public.
Meg Ryan, in an interview with the American magazine InStyle, said for the first time last week about the causes of the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
And then after the divorce, he found out how many women Dennis cheated on him with.
The psychic striptease was due to Ryan's new cheese work on "The Women," which tells the story of adultery.
Dennis Quaid responded decisively to his declaration of unfaithful husband: "Horseful," said the 54-year-old actor to the newspaper "New York Daily News," "that Meg repeats and spends the history of our relationship boringly."
In addition, it is "sad" that 16-year-old common boys, Jack, are repeatedly "publicly reminded of the many pain and the change that divorce causes a child."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid got married again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following cut: "In any case, my life continues.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is all right."
Prices of flights and hotel rooms are falling
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodations were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a recent study, flights in Germany have become less than 50 percent cheaper.
The prices of flights and hotel rooms have become more favourable again, so the results of a study by American Express travel and financial service provider can be summarized.
The company analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and found a significant price drop in the second quarter after the first quarter price increase.
After prices on the hotel market increased for years, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March, prices increased on average by 6.9 percent in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed compared to 2007.
However, in the period from April to June prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than a year ago.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the dollar as a low exchange rate, which led to the "soft travel mood" of American tourists.
The reduction in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London more than industrial cities such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, the 26.3% increase in hotel prices is a European record.
There was also an increasing change in the prices of flights in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist department had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007 and long-term flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, the average price of tourist-class flights decreased by 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but the prices in business and first class showed a much more moderate change.
Prices in Germany have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March, prices increased by 11.9 percent, and in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
According to the study, the prices of domestic flights in Germany have decreased by half.
On the one hand, the reason for the fall in prices lies in decreasing economic growth, the company claims.
Demand has weakened in many segments of the flight market.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement, which liberalises air travel between the US and Europe, strengthens the pressure of competition.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines cancel their loss-making flights and many airlines reported bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV was the leader of the table.
At Borussia, Luhukay still has no way of finding a working team.
Kristoffer Klein magnification Deep flying for the national team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player only got into the game late, and his raise bounced back from the gate.
His exact message left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," hissed Hermann Rieger in the hallway to the hamburger arena cabins.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physical therapist at HSV for nearly three decades, more prestige than some former players.
So his request was answered at the appropriate place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and agreed to show his thumb.
Cornelius is the chief coach of Hamburg, brother of Martin Jol.
His command must have said the same thing, "Give me the second goal."
The order has not been executed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight," admitted Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, thought of it as a looser picture.
The 1:0 (1: 0) goal result is due to the headmaster Mladen Petric of Hamburg (11); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachans could not cause pain to the weak people of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," added Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV will be 121 this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the audience celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, which showed their team as the top of the league.
It's gonna be a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the intermediate certificate of the tabella indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team is slowly finding itself, thanks to its late engagements - the Brazilian Names and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric and Jansen from FC Bayern - but not yet brilliant.
"We need more sense and deception," said Jol.
After the vote
Wall Street is full of fear.
In the first news of the failure of the rescue package, Dow Jones temporarily dropped 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in his history within a day.
Later, Dow grew somewhat stronger.
At 20:30, the world's most important stock market barometer was down by 5 percent and stood at 10.579 points.
The technology dealer Nasdaq fell to 1548 points with a seven percent minus.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America by 12%.
Not a single piece of paper has been strengthened.
The shares at Goldman Sachs Bank have dropped nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, he bought a stake in the bank with Warren Buffett as an investor.
In the context of the rescue operation, funds are planned to be made available for the acquisition of so-called dubious mortgage paper.
However, the amount is not intended to be paid at the same time, but gradually.
In return, the State would receive stock options from financial institutions, which would be viable if exchange rates were to be properly developed, reducing the burden on the state register.
European and American and share prices are downhill
Billionaire aid to European and US banks does not dissipate investors' doubts.
Hypo Real Estate's stock price is falling and taking Dax.
The US Dow Jones indicator is declining despite the state-planned rescue of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pushed the German share index (Dax) deep into the negative.
The value of Munich's real-estate financing shares has fallen to a quarter despite the federal government's and private banks' rescue operations, and Commercebank has weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax has sunk below the psychologically important 6,000-point limit and recorded 5839 points by 3.7 percent minus.
The stock markets around the world are on their knees.
Wall Street opened up in New York with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. it sank 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The American House of Representatives wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote could take place on 1 October.
The other European stock markets knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed 3.2 percent weakening, and the CAC 40 lost 2.9 percent in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index sank to 11,743,61 points by 1,26 percent after initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped back 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator failed 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor's shares weakened after the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank registered 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also stated that Thomas Cook shares would not be sold.
Dark matter affects space probe flight
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers, and dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully valid.
The Ulysses space probe flew into outer space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the soon-to-be-freeze fuel lines, there's a threat of frost death.
For years, scientists have caused confusion by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by means the gravitational swing of space probes, in which they gain additional momentum in the gravitational space of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This way, probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens, like the Ulysses solar probe, used this physical trick.
However, what has amazed researchers for many years: Flying objects do not behave fully as would be expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, abnormalities occur in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was called a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which perceives the mass attraction of matter as the warp of space.
American physicist Stephen Adler, an Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, continues to believe that Einstein was right and is trying to explain the swing-by anomaly with the so-called dark matter discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be responsible for the dark matter, which may be found even close to the Earth," writes Adler.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for ten years.
Obviously, it exerts a gravitational force that can be observed in its effect on other heavenly bodies.
However, the substance itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reattach any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists calculate that a good fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
Freed Tourists Abducted in Egypt
After ten days in the captivity of their abductors, the tourists who were taken away in Egypt are once again free, the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed.
The kidnappers in Sudan claimed millions of euros of ransom.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostage takers were reportedly killed.
Five German citizens have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already under way.
Over and over again, Germans become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports on the most important cases.
European tourists who have been taken away in Sahara are free.
This was also reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab TV and Italian media.
According to reports from the Italian TV station Sky TG 24, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our countrymen and other hostages were freed.
We are currently examining their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian citizen, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound, reported Egyptian state television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are reportedly on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting prior to the release of the hostages remain obscure: An Egyptian security officer said that the hostage takers had already shown willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprisingly killed their six.
"The problem is solved.
The ransom was accepted," the official said.
"The trial was just about taking the hostages," when the sudden "surprise" occurred.
On Sunday, six kidnappers were shot and two arrested in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The hostage takers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "Al-Masri al-Jom" newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers were concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers release female hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men are being held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"Suicide" by Stepfather Violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
The 57-year-old Michael Trerise, who lives in the Stithians village of Cornwall County, spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted sexual assault.
The Truro Criminal Court found out that he regularly tied up his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle between the ages of five and seven.
In one of Trerise's statements, he wrote, "I feel responsible for his death."
At the hearing, Randle committed suicide at the age of 34, in his home in the town of Plymouth in Mutley on April 1, 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise bound and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s, and once again chose Cornwall as his residence.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust Monument Protection Organization, was persecuted by images of violence repeated twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously been passionate about surfing and cycling, said she was "emotional dead" and "resigned from life."
In April 2007, his father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr Randle confronted the stepfather of his daughter, who concluded his statement in a letter: "I have always bound and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and I'm sure it was terrible for your victim, especially if you were only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
Even more thoughtful, however, is the fact that if you had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice."
The judge added: "I draw attention to the effect that Stephanie's parents have had on your daughter over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman."
The official who lost important data was indicted.
According to the BBC, a government official who left top-secret documents on a train in June is charged with breach of official secrecy.
The man was on a mission from the Ministry of Defense when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were forwarded to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
That's the slightest accusation of breaking the law, and there's no suspicion of a deliberate crime.
Frank Gardner, a reporter from the BBC Department of Defense, said that the move surprised many people at Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat this as an internal matter," he said.
The employee, who cannot be named, has been charged under Section 8.1 of the Act. This paragraph concerns the preservation of information.
The State's Attorney's Office has suggested that the prosecution of the official be represented by the Metropolitan Police for the man's work on the Unified Intelligence Committee, of a rather sensitive nature.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
On Monday, he was informed of the decision and moved from his home to an unknown place.
Housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
Britain's housing cooperatives can expect an account of over £80 million after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent £14 billion protecting the deposits placed at Bradford &amp; Bingley by 2.6 million account holders.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of deposit holders, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, president of the Association of Housing Cooperatives (BSA), it is "annoying" that companies and their members have to pay.
The loan of 14 billion pounds will eventually be repaid after the repayment of Bradford &amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, interest accumulated in the meantime is charged annually to the 700 financial companies that use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is annoying that institutions that have been acting carefully have now to pay the bills of institutions that have been far less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that each company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit it holds, and that companies share 18% of the costs among themselves.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the loan amounts to GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to save £81 million for the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the housing companies union, told the BBC that he considered the measure unfair.
"It is outrageous that institutions that have to pay the bills of far less cautious institutions that have acted with caution during the boom of the housing market."
According to BSA, no company has failed since they started operating in 1945.
"We need to look at this matter in every respect over the next few weeks in order to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of bill," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 shall cover 7 months from the end of September this year until the end of March.
In 2010, a full annual interest rate will have to be paid, which could be twice the current one.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organisations without shareholders, eventually members will have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates received after their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by another fivepence per litre from Monday.
This year, this is the second price increase since the two-penny increase in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
The resellers decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Prior to the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk last changed in 2002.
The request of Bangladesh's former Member of Parliament to defend himself on parole was rejected.
The Bangladeshi court rejected the application for immunity of former Member of Parliament Sheikh Hasina, which means that he could be arrested when he returned to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend him on parole on the charge of blackmailing a businessman with 50 million takas ($729,700) during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's former political opponent Khaleda Zia was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina must return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, Awami League, demands that the country's army-supported temporary government give her full freedom first.
According to reports, although he was paroled to go abroad for treatment, the conditions for his release are not clear as to whether he can maintain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say he's going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the appeal court's decision.
"The appeal court refused Sheikh Hasina's request for bail by saying that it is not necessary, since she has been temporarily released and is taking part in treatment abroad," we learned from lawyer Huq in Rafique.
"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal."
His lawyers argued that he needed the freedom to return to the country and prepare for the elections in December.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party said on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
Last year, he was detained after the temporary government supported by the army took over, but in June he was released from prison to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns about the vaccination programme against polio in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been excluded from the recently organised polio vaccination programme due to violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they were unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south.
According to a UN spokesperson, all of this happened despite the promise made by the Taliban: they will not attack or interfere with the work of thousands of inoculation personnel.
BSkyB's appeal to ITV has been rejected
BskyB's appeal against the Competition Committee's decision to reduce its interest in rival TV, ITV, was rejected.
The Competition Appeal Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its participation in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
In the past, the Committee concluded that BSkyB's share would hinder competition and would give the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its share in 2006 and effectively prevented NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from purchasing ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that BSkyB's stake in ITV was a threat to the independence of ITV, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
Virgin's director, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom surveillance all opposed buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV participation is pointless and disproportionate compensation, in particular with regard to the fact that BSkyB stated that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into the U.S. Attorneys' case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed special prosecutors to investigate the 2006 discharge of nine U.S. Attorneys.
The step followed by criticism of the decisions of government officials in the report on the case by the superintendent of the judicial portfolio.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators, and former US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state's attorneys had been released for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officials who have been heard during the investigation have tried to obstruct justice by lying.
"The serious allegations of possible crime have not yet been investigated or clarified," said Superintendent Glenn Fine.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who had the power to require witnesses to testify.
The series began with nine U.S. Attorneys being removed from the US judicial portfolio in December 2006.
At the time, they said the state's attorneys were dismissed because of their poor performance.
However, it turned out later that the discharge of state's attorneys received nothing worse than many of their other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that there was political consideration behind the dismissals.
Some state's attorneys were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressional members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of election fraud charges against Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are investigating and prosecuting the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but they cannot be removed from their position for political reasons.
At that time, the head of the court's wallet, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, became the target of assaults due to the discharges and eventually resigned.
Several other officials in the judicial portfolio have also resigned.
Gonzales's role in the case was greatly criticised in the Chief Inspector's report.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant to Bush Sr., are criticised for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf's Epic Recognizes
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honoured at the Q Awards Awards gala for the epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer, who will receive his special gold award at the London ceremony next week, said that he would be honored.
The nine minutes, fifty-five seconds long song was the titled song of Meat Loaf's 1977 album, the audience skiker.
Coldplay received the highest number of nominations for this year's prizes, they were placed in four categories on the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and "Bat Out Of Hell" such."
Jim Steinman's song required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an instrumental phase of almost two minutes.
It appeared as a single in 1979, and reached the 15th place on the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the charts for almost nine years, and after that more than 40 million copies have been sold.
Meat Loaf, actually known as Marvin Lee Aday, has recently had health problems, including having had surgery after he collapsed on stage in 2003, due to a heart rhythm disorder.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to acute laryngitis.
Later it turned out to be a cyst on his vocal cord.
An Unknown Metropolitan Street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of avenues, tours and other side roads, some of which are famous and others are merely practical.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-lived local residents find it difficult to tell where Extra Place is, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and it's more like a dusty alley than a main road.
There are no street signs.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, the Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to reconstruct the Extra Place and make sure that the shops and boutiques of the new buildings can be found in a cleaner way.
Street admirers include neighbors who have long lived here, who were caught in the truncated street by the fact that this was the only remnant of the neighborhood's past before renovations.
However, it is not in the interest of the owner of the street, the building maintenance and development department of the city, to insist on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district municipality's regional management committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer that the street remain in the city's management and requested the submission of a new plan next month, reported Susan Stetzer, district director of Municipal Council No. 3.
"There are very few areas in the city, and we want the Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," he said.
"There may be proposals for the renewal and treatment of Avalon, but we would also like to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to re-cover the small street and provide seating. Some of these would be used by a café, for which the builder is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first released at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, it does not insist on having it.
"The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to renovate this ruined alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city suggested buying it.
Seth Donlin, spokesperson for the Building Preservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office's task was to develop buildings and not to manage them.
Compared to his more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place doesn't have much historical significance.
Some say that in 1802, Philip Minthorne's great estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow plain.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, CBGB's back exit opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most famous of all that was taken on the cover of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia."
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clothing shreds, barrels and posters, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they took possession of the middle class East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the hands of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rarity, a fragment of the city that has remained virtually unchanged and should be left alone.
The blog writer Jeremiah Moss, entitled "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York," posted on his blog part of the story about Extra Place published in the "City Rumor" section of the weekly newspaper "The New Yorker" in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is dark even during the day, bordered by rusty, iron-made storage doors and sparet windows, and where the wind carries a week-long newspaper in the sewers."
The street, with a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street, near the back door that used to lead to CBGB, and now belongs to a higher priced clothing store.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty, 0.75-litre beer bottle lying next to a fresh pile of newspaper.
Some passersby told me that they rarely remember the Extra Place, but they think it could use the renovation.
Fields said that he thought that some people underestimated the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this section of the Education Monitor Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the views of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an experienced researcher in California studies at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research, and a co-author of the book "Not As Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
This includes Barack Obama's proposals on education.
According to Obama's campaign, "Afro-American and Spanish-speaking students are significantly less likely to get a degree than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports, inter alia, "transitional bilingual education" for English students.
At the same time, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on non-English education, overcomes his interest in overcoming high performance differences.
Take Sixth Street Prep, for example, as a standard school contract in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most of the school's students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than one third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, learn English.
Nevertheless, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results at the 2008 state mathematics exam.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of the fourth graders were excellent at the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means that Obama preferred.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous assessment of skills and rejection of objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should consider, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is "full immersion" of English students into the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of the English language in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said: "We have had an overwhelming success that if someone walked into a classroom, they would not notice who was the student who arrived from Mexico 12 months ago."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set as an example other schools with significant numbers of Spanish-speaking and English-educated students, such as Sixth Street Prep, as an example to follow?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer clear, but we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction because of the education policy of his own party (the National Educational Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since he himself consistently stands up for bilingual education.
Although he agrees that immigrants must learn English, Obama recently said that he was underestimating when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "only English" nature of the legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between results, he should study seriously the models that work instead of looking down at them and ignoring them.
Oil prices have fallen steeply due to renewed economic concerns
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
The securities on crude oil dropped seven percent to $99.80 this morning at the New York Trade Stock Exchange.
Prices have dropped by over $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, stock exchanges have been shaken by the Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached $145.29 per barrel in July, at the beginning of this month they fell back to almost $90 per barrel before they were again affected by the immeasurable uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, the concern reattached the investors even after the convention leaders announced that they had reached an agreement on the economic rescue mission, which is the largest in history.
The news has been shadowed by concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As the latest event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy up Wachovia Corporation's banking business, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital analysts, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, "the rescue operation seems to have failed to boost the trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for goods, such as oil, is also expected to decrease.
"The future of the market for ordinary shares, interest rates and currency exchange rates has become uncertain worldwide," said Deutsche Bank, an analyst for investors.
"We believe that the commodity market will not be avoided by the "plague."
The biggest question for the commodity exchange is the extent to which the U.S. 's disease' infects the world, especially China.
As oil consumption decreased due to economic growth, banks' analysts cut their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices for 2009.
With the feat of the second quarter, the team has set a record
After spending more time in the Jets jersey than anyone else in the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, who played in the defensive end position, thought he had seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the play of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranues Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, a perfect forerunner for an afternoon in which their unfolding cooperation evolved significantly.
Favre gave Coles two touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell in a row 10 seconds before the end of the half.
"I didn't regret the trouble," Favre said of all the passes he gave Coles.
"Hell's a good player.
We've always been able to communicate well, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, a cornerback player, caught a bad pitch and threw back 32 yards of touchdown.
Eric Smith, safety player reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn of events could have been the most amazing event in the match.
However, when Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal setting the 34:0 result.
That was the best result the Jets have ever achieved in a quarter.
When they asked Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-blowing nature of the game, he said, "The second quarter or the third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets getting one - Mangini said: "I must say, I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
We scored a lot of points in a short time. "
Relaxed Gebrselassie breaks her own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider him the best middle and long-distance runner ever, when he broke his own world record in Berlin on Sunday, making him the first to run 42.2 kilometers in two hours and four minutes.
With a victory on a comfortable plane track in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie improved her previous 2:04:26 result in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set a world record of 26 in so many areas that he won a world championship or a world record in almost every way from 1500 metres to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing, which, in retrospect, may have proved to be excessive caution, that air pollution would further aggravate her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect conditions - at sunny time, initially at 9 °C and at the end at 13 °C - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, at an incredible speed of 2 minutes and 56 seconds per kilometer.
Since the marathon had not previously been run by runners, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Tergat of Kenya turned to longer distances, the marathon record has decreased by more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won 2:06:05 in 1998 in Berlin.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago she had a cramp in her two calves and couldn't train for two weeks.
Clearly, during the emergency rest, he was refreshed and not rusty.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to reporters.
"Everything worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but everything was fine."
He received some criticisms, especially from Kenya, Ethiopia's rival in East Africa, that he uses too many aids during his races, usually avoids many world-famous marathon runners, rely on his stranglers as if he were running on a track and placed world records before the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's greatness in long-distance running.
Gebrselassie reached the midpoint on Sunday at 1:02:04 with four Kenyan runners.
Two top runners in Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave Gebrselassie the rhythm after the runaways got tired.
Shortly more than 4.8 kilometers before the finish, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, who reached the finish second 2:05:36, 5 minutes to improve his individual best.
Interesti reached the third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's competition, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The world record is held by British Paula Radcliffe at 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko won the London marathon with 2:24:14 results.
Because of the alleged back injury at the Beijing Olympics, he could not take part, but quickly recovered and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his individual peak by five minutes, the third marathon run he took part in.
He won the race with a clever calculation: first he allowed a group of Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then after about 30 km of running away he followed them.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa finished second with 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya came third with 2:25:01.
A Separate City, The Pride and Trials of Blacks
In the adventure park in Greater Orlando - a few miles away from everything that sparkles, loud and powerful - a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience were born.
Eatonville, the first purely black city to be integrated into the country, which was the childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is now not as simple as she described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet courts, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, a lot of guavas and two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage place now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, and Ruby Dee have been to the annual Zora Festival. The event in Eatonville is held in honor of Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
Yet, in many ways, the city he described and made a tourist attraction, which is also included in the Florida guidebook of the Federal Writers of the Crisis Project, is separate.
Just as independent, dignified and shut-in as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that Florida city blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages an open exchange of views on the race issue, many here are distrustful of the looks of outsiders.
"We are very careful how our story is told," said 59 - year - old Hortense Jones, who lived here his whole life and is a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say it correctly."
Eatonville has long been characterized by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historic model of black standing, but it is a community of almost 2,400 people, where poverty indicators reach double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of a sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture that flourishes in the shadows of oak trees.
It is not surprising, then, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
And the picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora, (everyone here calls Hurston that).
He presented his hometown to the world in sincere, strong dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and " Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17, which leads from the long forgotten center of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human dramas.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature as well as drumroll, introduced his readers to the business of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road, we find the modern public school with a brown background with white trims, carefully maintained courtyards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller tends, although he can barely read and write."
She mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and she wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and whatever you might need in temporary quarters."
So in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
Indeed, this description was not liked by everyone.
"Zora said things the way they were," said the 90 - year - old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the slippery songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the lively eccentric who often came home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77 - year - old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a roaring Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and wearing trousers in a city where people still pride themselves on their dignified dress.
Most people were charmed, Franklin said, but a lot of people did.
"People were always happy to see Zora," Franklin said.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books weren't published again.
Eatonville, along with most of the world, seemed to have forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
In Eatonville, there were no significant commemorations or major public readings.
"I don't think they understand how much he's enriched the world or what he's left us," said Valerie Boyd, author of the Hurston biography published in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
Orange County officials wanted to build a five-track road through the city instead of the two-track main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the community's life.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorways connecting states on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was recovering after a difficult period in history.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, fighting racial mix-ups tasted hatred with the community.
"A group of white boys came over at the time and threw oranges and other things at the side of the road," Franklin said.
"There was a lady who died of it.
They threw a watermelon out of a car."
In a letter to "The Orlando Sentinel" in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to impose violent integration, saying that "Brown v. Board of Education" was "more a violation than a respect for my race."
Today, residents say that although the dissegregation of schools was positive in some respects, it weakened the unity of the Eatonvilleers and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to being hugged - that's what I remember - by hugging their teacher morning and evening," N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, managing director of the nonprofit organization "Keep Eatonville Community."
"This lasted as long as the students and teachers came from a common place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher - I mean, there were cultural differences between us," said Nathiri.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston to rise - black writers, actors, and artists who have overcome prejudices, as she has done, with optimism and confidence, as follows: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the enjoyment of my company!
It's incomprehensible to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker went to Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, on the shelves of the bookstores, a renowned Hurston biography, written by Robert E. Hemenway, was placed on the shelves of America.
The road construction project would have started just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again at the center of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
The community started organizing a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what it would do to ruin the county's highway.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and many have since returned to the celebration every January.
Several years later, the county abandoned its road construction proposal.
"Due to the five lanes of the main road, the community is revived, turned to full speed, which means real civil pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd put it simple: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city's image of itself.
More and more people outside the city appeared, such as Lawyer Rachelle Munson, who started coming to church in 1993 and the locals began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-storey library (of course named Hurston) was opened, recovered and decorated on Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville remained Florida's cuckoo egg: it is not quite ten kilometers from the centre of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like it's a suburban side street during summer rain; it's as small as when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today 90% of the residents are black.)
They still take caution to the outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story, what he has to say.
Most interviews require prior permission, and some things, such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, which a white man painted and depicts black people working in the fields, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to bright red, fear that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston Festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown grew.
Especially young people see Eatonville more and more as Hurston saw his own race: wonderful, with problems and everything, no better, no worse, no as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is a genuine civic attachment from the words of Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return after graduation to take up work at the local government or the police, which he believes are in need of help.
And it seems that the younger ones have also learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just pass through here think this town is nothing compared to the others," said Alondra Kenon recently on Sunday after the service.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to get to know his history, it's a very nice city."
We all speak the language of finance here in New York
Nothing's changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstands and the huge television screens on Times Square, they wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with the glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture capital managers who have held New York in their power have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers are still rolling their metal tea trucks through the sidewalks, carrying cupcakes filled with muffin for morning meetings.
Men with Spanish lips are still squirming between the blocks, carrying as human mule fifty ironed shirts hanging from a yoke-like noose on their shoulders.
Office workers are still lining up for their breakfast sweet pastries at the food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi on weekdays between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m.
I didn't feel there was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite all the ominous news, I decided to open a new bank account.
Though I purposely planned to take care of it during the afternoon's rest in the local account of my JP Morgan Chase bank, there were about 20 people standing in front of me.
Not at the window of the bank teller, where you can withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter, where older customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many of them, I learned later from Starr, the banker who had been assigned to me, had the same intention as I did.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their home, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was taken from the so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings banks that operate only in one state and are supposed to treat their clients as family members.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have been silently destroyed.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with a capital of $327 billion, went bankrupt, and when the New Yorkers left for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank saver with $440 billion in savings.
The office and shop workers in front of me, fear of another collapse, moved their money to a bank that seemed like a safe haven, the bank that buys most capital injections on Wall Street.
In the last few weeks, the ordinary people of New York have become experts in finance.
A woman at the local Chinese department store on her phone talked about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and his huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if he were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the janitor in uniform on the block of my apartment, in his 50s, changed the subject, and we weren't talking about Brad and Angelina or my grocery delivery like we used to.
He spoke to me after I went to the bank: "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim tombs were slandered while Austria tilted to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a protest in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, at which the organization "Cities Against Islamic Circulation" presented itself.
They marched up with signs of traffic signs that represented mosques drawn across a red line.
According to police, extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when far-right parties significantly advanced in national parliamentary elections.
Over 90 graves were seriously damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators used spray paint to draw Jewish symbols, such as David's star, on some graves, but according to the investigators, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is somehow linked to the elections.
A spokesperson from the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shaken" at the sound of the sepulchre, which took place shortly before the Muslim religious month, the end of Ramadan.
In the meantime, Austria will conduct a conscience inquiry following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the political balance was tilted to the right.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which gained almost 30% of the votes, campaigned for the future of Austria, for a highly anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were branded as xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who has gained more than 18% of the votes, expressed his disapproval of the campaign against headbands and burkas, as well as the allegedly associated food with Islam.
At the party's final Viennese assembly, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamicisation of Austria and Europe.
According to the polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that led to the extreme better victory, the change was due to the largely young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from travelling abroad.
Garry Glitter, a well-known rock star convicted of rape of children, was banned from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after informing the control authorities of their intention to travel through France to Spain.
The Kent police obtained the ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence to the court of convictions against children against Glitter.
Glitter, actually known as Paul Gadd, did not attend the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
One court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kentian police applied to the Ashford Magistrates Court for the prevention of Paul Gadd's travel to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter has notified the authorities of its intention to travel abroad because it is bound by the law on those involved in the register of sex offenders.
You must notify the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also obliged to notify the police at least seven days before the planned departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years imprisonment.
The Kentian police said they didn't want to talk about specific cases and possible whereabouts in Glitter County.
We learned from the Kentian police spokesperson: "The Kentian police are doing everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad.
"We believe that it is easier to control someone if they do not leave the United Kingdom, because we have a comprehensive system here to manage potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the police in Kent is to protect the population of Kent, and through close cooperation we are constantly monitoring the behaviour of persons in the register of sex offenders and those in the county, in order to minimise possible risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a prison in Vietnam for the rape of a 10-year-old and an 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to board a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt unwell and refused to fly to London.
The regional authorities refused to pass the passport test, so he finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials from the regional police and immigration authorities insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, he arrived at Terminal 3 of Heathrow Airport on 22 August and stayed until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the court in West London, Uxbridge, because, according to Scotland Yard's request, he was entered in the register of sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for possession of photographs of child rape.
According to a source at the Ministry of Interior, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for Home Affairs, welcomed Glitter's refusal to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I'd like to introduce the artist from a personal point of view"
No sets, no ruffles, no dancing shoes.
The masterpieces of flamenco from close to the body, without the excitement of the performance: to get to know the everyday face of the dancers.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, ordinary people.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate, distant moments from the audience, when we can look at a personal movement, grab the depth of an eye caught, or marvel at the inaction of the artist who is about to perform on stage.
In the German photo series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, he combines the theatricality of singers, dancers and guitarist with this less-known everyday side of the masters.
Through the photos, the special iconography of flamenco is presented from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco's Month of Photography, "represents the growing international significance of flamenco from day to day," says the creator, adding that Flamenco-people "can be a character for anyone, since, in view of the images, the observer realizes that these images do not represent artists in a typical way.
These people on the street are artists who are capable of bringing passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and captivating the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for grabbing their personality.
Their personality and character are in the deepest part of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco with the help of the camera."
The Cante de las Minas festival gave a kick-start start to Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarist and dancer with a record camera.
These portraits quote classical photography thanks to the camera and the theme selection.
However, the use of various stylistic tools breaks with traditional visual representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "This is a music with traditional roots, which, however, changes day by day and is always fascinating."
Not dancing, not singing or music in itself, but rather the artist's personality and character charm the audience.
In the days, the main motif of the works that can be seen in the El Fotomata gallery is the search for the essentials, the encounter with the artistic wharf, which becomes visible through the way of perception, existence and visualization.
The known figures of flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, represent this photo collection of nearly 60 artists.
The project also became a flamenco anthology, about which an album covering the portraits presented at the exhibition will soon be released.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraits prompted him to repeat the idea with the series "Portraits of Veteran Athletes" ("SportART Project").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I really like to photograph people, get to know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre in photography is portrait.
People you meet, people you meet, people you don't even know sometimes, people that just take a few minutes to shoot.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled Flamenco-people, can be seen in the El Fotomata Gallery, which is parallel to Alameda de Hércules, until October 16.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he's working on is "ready recklessness."
The scene and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is still working on writing his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo for 20 years and has been to Amazonia.
Last night at the Hay Festival Segovia, a writer also won the Nobel Prize for Literature admitted that his current work was "ready reckless" and "all signs of no need to write" the novel.
"If I were smarter, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it, and I hope I can end it at some point" - with these words he concluded his presentation at the festival of ideas, thought and opinion exchanges, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of visitors in the city of Aqueduct for four days.
The author of "City and Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants of the Literature Festival, and he fulfilled his expectations.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' novel "Our Common Friend."
After Felix Romeo's toast, a dedicated audience welcomed him. For the public, the hour soon ran away, during which the Peruvian writer told him with a wonderful memory and a great amount of humor how his writing profession developed from the unique adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live; how he overcomes the lack of inspiration with disciplined writing methods, diligent documentation, many repairs and rewriting; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas had an impact on his writing profession, and on what memory images his stories were based on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether books changed our lives, but added: "I do not think that literature is mere entertainment or an experience of teenage flowers" because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked writers not to give in to the temptation of lightness and to bear responsibility for their vocation.
Step-time weather makes the farewell at Pozoblanco shorter, and horse bullfights are cancelled
The horse bullfight, traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco festivals, was canceled yesterday morning after the future horse bullfighters found the arena's terrain unfit for the tournament.
As a result, the committee decided to cancel the bullfight with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández.
The weather hardships have greatly damaged the series of celebrations, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain left the second bullfight behind.
The future protagonists, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista would have fought with Castilblanco bulls.
So they didn't have a bullfight until Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, he brought home three ears as a trophy, and after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, he was brought around with his shoulders raised.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante received a number of awards and trophies, but this was due to the audience rather than to its own performance.
It was then that El Juli, who had made little contribution to improving the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
With the second bull, after a comfortable march, the majority of the audience was out of control.
In his dream, a van carrying two tons of hashish tried to escape a road inspection
It's 4:50 in the morning.
The Basque Territorial Police carry out traffic checks in the administrative area of Armiño (Alva).
The authorities are stopping a van in which two are travelling, and the passengers are trying to escape the action.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not noticeable at the same time.
The detectives chased the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A.A.J., reported the Basque Government Department of Home Affairs.
The captured man is charged with drug trafficking and forgery.
The case occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the employees of the Állavai Traffic Control carried out traffic checks on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the checkpoint.
Detectives chased him, then the vehicle stopped a few miles away on the landing lane, and his passengers fled the highway to a forested area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily van, they seized its shipment of 2178 kilograms of hashish.
Hashbals filling the rear of the vehicle were transported by the police to be subjected to a more thorough investigation and to the measurement of the drug.
In addition, the verification has shown that the vehicle's false registration plate does not match the data contained in the van's papers and that the arrestee is therefore also prosecuted for counterfeiting of the authentic instrument.
The Basque Regional Police continue to investigate the arrest of the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, fled the highway and the identification of the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A.J., was sent to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations, and court proceedings were initiated within a few hours.
They arrested the actress Heather Locklear for driving under the influence of drugs.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend by the police in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of medicine.
According to one eyewitness, he tried to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange maneuvers - said People magazine, a spokesperson for California traffic control.
According to the witness, Locklear "put the gas to the floor, cried the engine, tried to leave the parking lot both forward and backwards, and went through his sunglasses several times in reverse."
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police 'cause he was worried about Locklear's life.
When the police arrived, the actress was in her car, which partially crippled the traffic on the highway.
"He seemed upset," so patrols took him to a specialised center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was ruled out almost immediately, and the spokesperson also said that according to the officers' first impression, they believed that Locklear was under the influence of medication.
Locklear was arrested and charged with driving under the influence of an unidentified substance.
Locklear came out of a nursing home in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) andalus Federation to take action in the Silva case
Gaspar Llamazares, Secretary General of the IU and United Left, today stated that the regional Federation of the Corps will decide on the case of the former Youth and Sport Councillor of the Seville Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after being accused of misusing his position and abusing his family members.
"I am a far-reaching federalist in these matters, and this matter is indeed within the jurisdiction of the Andalusian organization," Llamazares pointed out the procedure that the party must apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that, when detecting any irregularities that Silva might have committed, it should be borne in mind that "transparency' should be considered: "At IU has always advocated maximum transparency in such cases'.
He added that the training included "the strict code of ethics for civil servants."
May blood, the epic work of Garci
Benito Pérez's National Episodes, inspired José Luis Garci, who commemorates the famous anti-French uprising of the Spaniards in May's blood, which, with a budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest work of his filmography.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate the flow of people and social analysis he had always admired in the work of the well-known novelist. All of this was presented today in the film presentation with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarria to the audience of actors.
The more than two-and-a-half-hour May Blood is presented in the cinemas on Friday, and later the Telemadrid will screen it as a miniseries in over four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós's literature, achieved his childhood dream with this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirrre, who commissioned him three years ago from Madrid Province to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of Madrid's events on 2 May. Garci accepted the invitation on the condition that the National Episodes could provide the basis for the story.
The budget of 15 million was entirely financed by the Autonomous Province of Madrid, and it was a special opportunity for Garci to present with a contemporary set and costume "the confused Spaniards who, by mistake, sided with a bad leader, because the struggle for independence pushed the country to a great disadvantage with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director regretted that he could not count on the budget of the phantoms of Alatriste or Goya, who had more than double-kicked May's blood, and therefore he was forced to miss some scenes from the script, which, as many other times, is recorded with Horacio Valcárcell.
So he used the usual method of working for the director of the Restart, recording the scenes with the actors he started rehearsals with before shooting. Casting wasn't because Garci considered it "humiliating," and because, as he said, "the director's profession is part of the theatre and the cinema to find out what's going on in the industry we work in."
Several actors of the May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not come before his camera for the first time.
Garci, who boasts four Oscar nominations and an Oscar prize, believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, namely the May Blood, the Seven French Billiards table and the finally selected Blind Sunflowers, represent the young generation of Spanish cinema, "should be presented dead," he said.
Garci with this movie doesn't expect any awards.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that it's all about getting well and finally you're happy to have another movie done," Garci says with a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer in Seville remembers a dancer in Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana district and moved to London with his parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dancing and an expert in Oriental dances.
During his busy life, he pioneered women's equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought against wearing corsets that hinder women's freedom of movement.
He started a dance and aesthetic revolution in war in Europe, his life dazzled Isabel Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, she recommended Tortola to my attention, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to grasp her soul.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
For example, the dance of the butterfly to the Guaji or the tango to the "snake dance."
"He danced emotionally, and according to others, that's what my style is," he says.
The light of the performance is highlighted by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda, after the Open Door, now sings again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who in this case exceptionally wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to the invitation, and I'm very honored to have you perform in my play."
In addition, the production includes music directors and guitarist Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, musicians Miguel Ortega, singers el Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussionist El Pájo, Viola Viola Viola, and the actor Juanfra Juárez, who "plays the true diva with his love all the time."
The piece also presents a large part of the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and reaches even remote landscapes, including India, the United States, or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but these days he is no longer known and much less appreciated by his work," says Bayón.
The performance will begin tonight at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, "The Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also appears.
The first illustrated edition of the diary of a newly married poet will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation is part of a series of programs entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organized by the Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Nobel Prize for Literary and the anniversary of their two deaths.
In this way, the closing record of the Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-release of this work, the International Congress in New York, the restoration of the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial house and the travelling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That Shiny Poplar Tree." The exhibition opened in May this year, visited several Andalusian provinces and was scheduled to visit New York during the International Congress.
The Cultural Committee of the Andalusian Regional Government has acquired eight hundred copies from the diary of a newly married poet named Perdo Tabernero, illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Enciso, to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Not so attractive America without Paul Newman.
"God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that."
The quote comes from the actress Sally Field who worked with Newman in the film The Victims of the Sense, and reflects the shock and helplessness caused by Newman's death in American cinema and throughout America.
How hard it was for him to get the Oscar.
He retired in 2007,
And he was known to be ill,
But even so, everyone was shocked by his death.
"Sometimes it's impossible to put our feelings into words, and I've lost a good friend," said Robert Redford in tears, "his existence has made my life and this country better."
No one was afraid that it might become ridiculous or overdoing it.
One of the heroes of the cinema and home went away in a particularly dark time, shielded by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-esteem and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many lose their virtues easily and there are very few people left to look up to, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, it was a platonic idea of beauty and justice.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and defender of lost and won cases, starting with the birthplace of his first-born son, who died of drug overdose, to the creation of a home-made organic food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was having difficulty moving past its food culture of suicide.
The overwhelming wave of admiration has spread all over Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, said it wasn't a man, it was an era that died with him.
Another Englishman, the Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the culmination of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, who is perhaps one of the few who try to follow Paul Newman's lifestyle today: they require honesty and a serious and remote privacy from cameras.
This is not always easy, if at all possible, in the middle of today's media jungle.
Still, some people try, and Paul Newman is his role model.
Once divorced, but after 50 years of faithful marriage to Joanne Woodward, she certainly would have had many opportunities to be unfaithful.
"Why should I eat hamburgers somewhere else if there's meat at home?" he joked.
In heaven, you can be proud that you are also a fan of your daughters on earth, which is not very common in America.
"Of all his performances, he was not as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather, and the devoted philanthropist role," they say.
The Rough Way of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of an Olympics in Madrid, and after 2012 failed, it may become 2016.
But, I ask you, are we really ready for this?
'Cause if we're starting from yesterday's race, I don't think we are.
They called it a perfect race, but from what I can tell, it was the worst of all the things I've ever been to.
It was marked by a multitude of incompetences, and if I had to be evaluated once and I was the examiner, the result would be clearly a failure.
But first things first, let's start at the beginning.
The meaningless things started with taking over the serial number, which meant they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go faster, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in a later line).
That's not what happened.
At first, they gave only the serial number (first nonsense, only to go there sooner) and (after the usual line), what a surprise, it was only a T-shirt (second nonsense, because my size is XL)!
What kind of world do we live in?
Or did the crisis decide to save money and buy cheaper, small T-shirts?
Anyway, these things are still dwarf compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to going there awfully early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes after arrival, and even the backpack had to be delivered.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a running race with more than 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't turned in the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain made the more pleasant the more than 40 minutes of waiting, which was covered by popular uprising and stand-attack experiments.
I think we'll have about 500 sure pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, won't be getting our place with our actual time, because I assume my chip has got it wrong.
If you asked me about the perfect running race, I wouldn't happen to think of that, of course.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Looking for Microsoft (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of - not too intelligent - artificial intelligence, however, capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle on the company's territory) on the basis of information heard from the conversation.
This "receptionist" can recognize the number of people in the room with a camera and a form and facial recognition system, who they are - and even notes what kind of clothes they wear - and hear and understand the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, he can group the people present on the basis of conversations.
In the presentation video, the receptionist lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she is neither a member of the company nor an employee of the company.
He asks if he has come to see someone and assures me that he will soon come to his aid.
All without the blue big screen.
Fascinating.
But this is, of course, the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
This week, a lot of people said that Microsoft was changing strategy.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were to run only the necessary programs instead of all the commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
They invented Spanish wax, since Microsoft has added additional features and extras to Windows in every new version so far.
Change of course will pay off.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is becoming increasingly out of the way, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google had taken the first step to compete with Windows.
Many correctly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, as it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
She plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system should be considered, not in absolute terms, but in relative terms.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this idea.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and more and more to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time to browse than we spend in the world of windows.
What is most of the applications associated with the system then for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
It's less difficult, less burdened, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services online rather than as an alternative to Google.
They really need all this, and I'll give you an example of why.
I took this photo at the beginning of the month in a lounge for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, a poster is called upon to use the company's browser. - "Your browser, our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced to slip.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the mobile phone functions more and more as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, it's definitely gonna ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in the bloody diamond of Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick, and Al Pacino in the godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, as well as one of the basic costumes of the build-up gay customer.
And while we're on the list of specialties, we might as well recall the peace figure of the travelling circus's carry-on-the-loose-loose-in-the-box.
But what are we talking about?
I mean, "tank," as the Angolans call it, but no rival of le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of its elegant name - although only known as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to sport, according to the legend, Marcel Cerdan was named after the boxer, the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex cut, special logo and small (unidentifiable) Belgian flag make it obvious to its competitors. The latter is carried by the most typical models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports tops, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool trousers, sailor's shirts, baby dresses, miniseries - and so on - are all part of the company's products.
And they all belong to the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is unfortunate that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is"
He is very much like his brother, but he was able to achieve himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters want to play a bigger role in the fashion world.
To Monica, modeling means more than just some pretty and pretty girls putting their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris, as well as the most prestigious fashion prizes sponsored by the Spanish company.
The warmth and mildness that comes from it is intriguing.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We're presenting the new fall-winter collection of Mango, planned with my brother Penélope, and we're also attending the second Mango Fashion Awards competition and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino.
Quite a busy day, yes, but very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango.
We both love the movies of the '50s and '60s; we've taken a lot of things from there.
Besides, I often just walk around the city and watch women dress up, change and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You work as a dancer, actress and fashion designer.
That's what I think, but in the end, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
I was interested in clothes when I was a kid, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and go through my aunt's wardrobe.
Well, that was you on the kanaan, almost up to an amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for lessons and rehearsals to have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in acting, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
See, it's all connected with everything, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than I've ever been, I like the 30s.
I think that's when women are really worth it, they've had enough experience and made fewer mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't bother me.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been doing what I feel like doing, and it makes me very happy inside.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I certainly don't want to miss this.
As for the future father, it doesn't matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's say a few words about the movie, you made more movies last year that weren't even shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started in the theatre, am very impatient and restless, want everything immediately, but of course I know that's impossible.
I look forward to the presentation of the final hour and the search for the grave of Christ.
I wonder what you'll say to them...
I understand you debuted on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
Naomi Campbell has been known for a long time, and she simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own Women for a Better World. I chose two of my own Mango collections. The clothes presented were auctioned and the money received was offered to Naomi's NGO.
People don't know how good-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much talk about him, I know him, and I can assure you, it's not half true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his activities.
He asked me to do the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I would have done it.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I don't know the impossible.
Retrospective drunk drivers will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
After three drunk driving violations, the Ministry of Interior would require the motorist to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from starting if the driver was in a drunk state or if it wasn't blown.
The proposal was presented in June and is now being dealt with by the State's Attorney's Office, according to which the pilot project will last a year.
As the aim of the project is to restore it to the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Public Prosecutor's Office for Transport Safety, DG Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Auto Safety Technology (FITSA) participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of motorists arrested for drunk driving are back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, since the system connected to the vehicle determines the alcohol level of the air sprayed into it. If it is higher than permitted or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than 1000 euros would be a violation of the rules.
A study carried out in the 2007 US showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure focuses on offences for two reasons: it is easier to prevent them from turning into criminal offences,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce because the legal reform is being implemented in the usual way, while the necessary reform of criminal matters requires a fundamental amendment.
The instrument is not yet available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party to encourage the installation of the system in school buses, on a French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
With English accuracy, the Spanish Air Force Asturias Princely Party's plane landed at the Presidential Hangar of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City at 5:40 p.m. on the date announced in the program.
The sun was setting, but it was still so high that we could only see the royal party leaving the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs were the Spanish ambassador and other prominent personalities.
A few hours before, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew the Spanish Prince Couple were coming to town for an official visit.
Okay, well, there's not gonna be an airport transfer for a long time... she's from around here or something.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, well...
But the Mexican press, they know all about the Asturias Prince Couple and the significance of their visit.
Many are waiting at the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon of 27 sailors who protect the dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, wearing a sea blue dress, and then the Princess, in her long hair, caught by the wind, in her restrained clothing, but not in her usual shoes flashing her toes - perhaps a warning that Mexico City was being threatened by a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile for the cameras, then enter the room, where the official reception will follow.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, one of the mouthpieces of Mexican television is waiting for them.
The Most Valuable Fashion Prize
A fashion award is undoubtedly the most suitable place in the world for Paris, and the most sophisticated and cool of all fashion designers living today is definitely Valentino.
Mango has recently announced the second El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards competition, which aims to promote young talent in fashion.
The prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first competition, saw her own designer clothes in the window of Mango, under 54 in Paris, and she was almost in tears.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European business and has recently opened at 1335 sq m.
The largest store is located in London.
In the midst of many events and thanks to Valentino for chairing the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxurious dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagals, Mango's table of presidents of the gala dinner was even more spectacular.
Nati, who had come with a heavy heart and sadness because of his brother's recent death, wore a piece of the Company and some of the breathtaking ornaments of the ELAH.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests, and they were so chivalrous that they ended up without a suit, since they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in her own pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At the night's opera visit, Gaya Toledo was so envious in the ballet room that, recalling old times, she went to one of the bars and improvised a grand plie kind of thing.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but before that, he showed me some photos of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy Oliver Martinez - he was two meters tall and motorized - and John Travolta also arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he told us in advance that he did not want any scent in the room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress relief number
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000 and there's one way to turn off chaotic and messy everyday life.
In other good news, we can find them all in a single book that arrives in the bookstores on 30 September to bring peace with us.
The clock ringing at 7:00 a.m. is almost tortured, but it's even worse to think about how fast the world is making me live every day.
The name of the office is tension, and the computer has back pain.
Stress is a population disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and work problems.
No, this number is exactly equal to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of options in her book so that everyone can find a solution that suits her most and adapts to her free minutes.
The stress-solving work is called the 1001 relaxation method and the calm that flows from it comes to the bookstores from Pearson Alhambra y DK.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be removed from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake you down in your faith.
In addition, it also offers other ideas that all help relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make 100% natural food.
If you're too low to refresh your adrenaline and you've become a central problem in your stress life, it's time to sit back in your chair, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but those who talk in their sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually quite harmless.
This benign sleep disorder is called somniloquismus.
It is quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have been told that you spoke at night.
Regarding its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, it only occurs once in a high fever disease) or more systematic (every day, once a week or monthly) and usually the child does not remember anything the next day.
Its appearance cannot be traced back to a single underlying cause.
Often accompanied by other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night alarms, bed-wetting (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal either.
As has already been mentioned, it can be accompanied by a high fever or stress or heightened excitement.
In any case, they've been little studied so far.
The intensity of speech also varies greatly.
It may be quiet, calm, out of incoherent words, murmuring, but in contrast, it may also occur in the form of shouting, crying, or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and contact a specialist. The study may reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety and thus offers a solution.
As mentioned above, this is a benign phenomenon, and therefore there is no cure unless it is associated with other manageable forms of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress).
However, there are a few things we can do, and here is a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure that the child remains calm before going to bed.
Choose comforting games and avoid children watching fear - inspiring or more aggressive TV shows or shows.
Children who tend to get nervous or have difficulty relaxing are taught some relaxation methods to help them find inner peace.
This will help the child to sleep better.
If you do start talking while you're sleeping, let's try to stay calm.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and the next day, they won't remember anything.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be pointless, because the child is unconscious, but he'd be out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps longer and rests.
Remember, if you have frequent episodes of severe anxiety, it is advisable to contact a specialist or explore what triggers extreme anxiety in the child.
If you speak clearly (this is the rarest case), don't start asking questions to find out anything from him.
It would be unnecessary, since he is not conscious enough to collect his thoughts during sleep.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you can't see the dream images associated with it, so be careful of the interpretation of what you hear and any conclusions.
Never tell the kid they can question him at night about his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
This causes a great deal of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
Illhaezern at last in a straight line
After a long deep flight, the Illhaezern team finally gained a new momentum and won the victory again in the home field.
Although it wasn't a raging match, the yellow-blacks were in a number of situations, one of which they could eventually win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first shot was attempted by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the distant ball just touched the upper corner of the gate. Then the Illhaezern came to the top, and the shots followed one another: Fonderflick tried a remote shot, and Hirn's shot went over the gate. Roman spic and Diebold also tried to waver Dannemarie's defense with a distant attempt.
On the other side, the players joined in a block to defend themselves on the midfield, and only the ever moving Riahi was in a shooting position.
The start of the second half was a crucial one: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on Dannemarie's side. Immediately after that, the first goal was born: after Diebold's first shot, the Marais of Illhaeusern scored the ball with an excellent position and then put it in the gate (53 min).
However, the scorer of Illhausern did not enjoy the glory for long: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to continue fighting at a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, on the other hand, could not take advantage of it: they did not cause much trouble for the home team, who had just pulled back a little to strengthen their defense. The last seconds alone saved some excitement when, after a great rush, the ball got very close to the gate.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before you fly to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen crippled the traffic of several Breton and Norman ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with the representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to welcome the president in a "constructive spirit" and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with "specific proposals."
The President's visit coincides with the meeting of the 'crisis committee', which was set up by Breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against an increase in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average price of the record of EUR 1,14 per litre.
David Martinon, spokesperson for the President of the Republic, said that the President would "negotiate with fishermen on ways to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers."
Fishermen are determined to await Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, traffic-slowing demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados counties, causing congestion of nearly 10 km long.
They also disabled the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle-île were not blocked.
Roadblocks were placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination, and at that time at dawn, tires and pallets were set on fire in front of the fuel depots of the Brest ports, while protests took place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. For example, in the Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, fishermen did not board ships, while in Le Havre some twenty ships blocked the traffic of commercial ships.
At night, fishermen from La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in the County of Loire-Atlantique, have abolished the huge Total oil refinery blockade in Donges.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting in the Ministry on Wednesday by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the crisis committee must decide on Tuesday on its next move and participation at the meeting planned at the Paris Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the heads of the National Fisheries Commission, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues," said Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil are currently paying around 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the operation of a ship would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The Amazing Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" in Connecticut's home at 83 years of age, suffered from cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid their respects to Paul Newman, an actor dedicated to the legend and vocation of the cinema that died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its delivery plans for 2008
Despite the global economic crisis, the Brazilian aircraft company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
Embraer, the world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, can keep the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, president of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is counting heavily on the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120 seats aircraft.
Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, set up by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that had been paid to it, reports the Financial Times' Dominican edition.
In addition to his international life insurance and US pension insurance activities, AIG would be able to part with most of its other branches, the newspaper explained, citing funds close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sale.
AIG has not confirmed this information.
The assets that AIG intends to sell include the company's aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance undertaking, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the paper, there is no final decision on sales.
AIG must quickly obtain liquid assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan approved by the US Government, taking the risk that it will have to withdraw from 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders accordingly.
Paris Historique's study of Morning Meeting's historic Morning Meeting meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected Paulson's bank rescue plan. The Dow Jones index dropped by 6.98% (which means a decrease of almost 800 points, never seen before), and Nasdaq by 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average Index (DJIA) was down by 777.68 points, thus closing at 10 365.45 points.
The biggest decline in the index so far (684.81 points) was registered on 17 September 2001, when trading resumed following the terrorist attack on 11 September.
With a fall of 199.61 points based mainly on technological papers, Nasdaq closed at 1,983,73 points, while the expanded index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 decreased by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was already indisposed at the time of the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly refused a bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it began a deep-fly.
Members refused to provide the funds requested by Minister for Finance Henry Paulson by 228 'no' votes against 205 'yes'.
Nearly two thirds of the Republicans voted against the plan.
"The market has filtered out the wrong signals, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, analyst of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market expected this plan," he added, and then expressed his concern that if such a plan were to be adopted a few days later, it would be "too late."
"If the plan is really doomed (...), then it will be up to Fed (American central bank - ed.) and the other central banks to deal with the crisis and the lending conditions will continue to tighten," warns Brian Bethune, Chief economist at Global Insight.
To further enhance the sense of urgency, Piegza adds that "a new financial institution is going bankrupt every day" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities ensured that Wachovia's banking business would be bought by its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated suddenly, requiring emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that the market has "not only developed an American but also a global crisis," adds FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has risen considerably.
The 10-year government bond yield decreased from 3,827% to 3,632% on Friday night and the 30-year-old dropped from 4,357% on the previous day to 4,161%.
Obama won the first TV duel
The first debate of the two U.S. presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the duel.
Unsurprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign leaders claimed victory in the television duel followed by one third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's performance was honorable, it did not prove impressive enough to stop his popularity: this is demonstrated by five weeks before the presidential elections.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democratic candidate stands better in the fight: according to the polls published on Saturday, Obama has five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most calculated, still indeterminate voters, 39% of respondents say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a survey conducted by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partner, Joseph Biden, who promises to be great Thursday. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned this weekend: "It would be wrong to underestimate Palin.
He's got a good feeling."
McCain, in his 70s, never misses his own, undisputedly enormous foreign policy experience. Nevertheless, he emphasizes his opponent's "nave" in these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that," said the attack several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for his presidential position," said McCain.
This is the main attack site that has been exploited by Republican TV ads since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represented the future.
He did not allow himself to be embarrassed: he expressed himself in a focused and precise manner.
He stressed his ability to make good decisions and restore the world's image of the United States.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama does," the Democratic ad, broadcast this weekend, points to the Republican leader's eye that he still hasn't assessed the impact of the crisis on the American street people.
"In the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the electoral meeting.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "workers" on his lips. The confusion in the financial world undoubtedly favors Obama, who the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy on the brink of collapse.
"Next week may prove to be a turning point," said Charles Schumer, the influential Democratic Senator yesterday.
Democratic MEP Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton government, says that Obama has "the best instincts in the economy" like Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the "final judgment over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain."
The Illinois senator reconfirmed that, despite the stock exchange fluctuations, he would be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans, adding that his primary objective is to achieve the country's potential energy independence through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided issues concerning the $700 billion bank rescue plan (€470 billion): the extremely unpopular plan was adopted last night by Congress.
Minsk: "Did you notice that there was an election here?"
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday evening at the Main Square of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, after the closing of the polling stations, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square to protest against the forgery of election results.
Although results have not yet been published, a number of young people protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the words: "Dictator, resign."
Some admit that they didn't even go to vote: "Why would I go? They'll do whatever they want with my vote anyway," says a young man.
The demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which tried to make itself look good for foreign observers to build relations with the European Union, is ready for a democratic regime change.
If the elections were judged clean by observers, they could lift the sanctions imposed on the country, in which they refused to grant a visa to 40 Belarusian leaders and frozen some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were kept away from the electoral committees, and our observers could not take part in the count of votes," lamented Yuri Potemkin, spokesperson of the coalition of the United Democratic Forces.
"The changes were only nominal," said Alexander Milinkievich, opposition candidate for the Presidential elections in 2006 and leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who counts the votes and, in this case, that is the executive power.
If the opposition delegates get into Parliament, it means they've been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament will allow them to sit on television, meet in the regions of the country and submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore step up in political life because "the dialogue with the European Union must be initiated."
Because if our heavily indebted economy against Russia is in crisis and we are unable to regenerate, we risk falling under Russia's jurisdiction.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate appears to be too high and that the broad organisation of the preliminary vote (26% of the voters in Minsk) has given rise to any manipulation.
"Did you notice that there was an election here?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, who was released from prison as the last of his own in August this year, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polls.
Up to five opposition representatives will be included in Parliament, namely those who are most suited to the leadership.
October Square is back to the silence of the night.
On television, President Lukashenko and the members of the central electoral committee rejoice to succeed.
Blood Safe Again
Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its founding yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary had good reason to celebrate, because Héma-Quebec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood donor companies in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain people's trust, which was seriously shaken by the scandal about infected blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserve administered by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, in February 1994, the government of Canada, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched a formal investigation to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid similar future cases.
While Judge Krever has submitted a delayed report, some provinces have set up their own committee to design a new blood management system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gelineau Committee fulfilled this task.
Following the Gelineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one is Hema-Québec serving Quebec, and the other is all the other provinces and the Canadian Blood Supply Corporation responsible for two territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in Quebec's blood supply system," recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the following years, however, we have regained people's trust as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in the field." Décary proudly states that nearly 94% of the population in Quebec considered Héma-Québec reliable at the beginning of 2008.
However, Dr Décary does not forget that "trust is extremely fragile."
Since the foundation of Héma-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the principle of caution.
During this period, a number of cases of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been discovered in Europe, says the doctor, who has been managing the company since its founding in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we relied on one of the most important recommendations in the Krever and Gelineau reports. According to this, if we are uncertain about this and are at risk of developing a serious disease, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, we were talking about Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which causes the brain to change, thus inevitably leading to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was established beyond any doubt that the disease was transmitted by blood.
This case convinced us that it made sense to apply the principle of caution."
In 1999, a technique appeared on the market that allows the HIV virus to be more susceptible to diagnosis. It is a nuclear acid test (NAT) that can directly detect the virus in the blood of blood donors rather than antibodies against the virus on which the tests used previously were built.
The NAT test allowed us to shorten the window period, which is afraid of infection until we can detect the virus in the blood using our technical tools, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
Thus, they significantly reduced the risk that blood donors would unknowingly infect blood and that this could not be detected.
These developments have greatly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of receiving HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
"In other words, this means we should distribute 12 million blood products while someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes 400 to 500 000 blood products each year, it would take more than 24 years for such a case to occur and for someone to become infected with HIV through a blood product.
I think that today anyone can accept or prescribe blood transfusions to restore health, says the number one leader of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen is going into the system.
It was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, gets into the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must be on guard at all times," said Dr. Décary, then stressing that apart from emergency reserves, Héma-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"Aging the population also increases demand.
Since anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need replacement of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the population of blood donors, as the number of people in the network who are willing to donate blood accounts for only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, all healthy individuals aged at least 18 years who meet the eligibility criteria may donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria is devastating are not entitled to donate blood for a year.
"With this 3 percent, we have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare to run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood donors to the extent that existing ones are getting older, because they can no longer give blood after a while.
However, it is very difficult to convince people to donate blood, but it is even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In today's rushing world, a man has barely an hour to go and give blood," Francine Décary regrets.
Héma-Québec, which holds an annual budget of USD 297 million, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned individuals.
These tissues are analyzed, converted and frozen and then placed at Hema-Quebec, which also manages a single public stem cell bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, once treated as medical waste, can produce blood that is rich in stem cells, thus allowing the treatment of severe diseases (such as leukaemia).
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the entry into our bank of the thousandth cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them to transplants," said Dr. Décary, who said that the umbilical cord blood collection program is very popular today.
"Many mothers are sad because they do not have the opportunity to do so" - it is true, because Héma-Québec cannot make this complex and costly program available in all of Quebec's hospitals.
Soccer - the Impact in the semifinal
The Montreal Impact team beat Seattle Sounders at the USL-1 qualifier by 3:1 yesterday and reached the semifinal with the combined 4:3 result. This was the second and decisive match of the quarter-finals at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was scored by the midfielder Antonio Ribeiro in 90 minutes of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, two midfielders of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, found themselves in the opponent's net.
Roger Levesque was the only one on Sounders who managed to play Matt Jordan's goalie.
Remember that in his first match on Friday, Impact lost 2:1 from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, the outskirts of Seattle.
Impact plays the semifinal with Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder's team lost 3:1 from Whitecaps in the first match won 4:3, but in the semifinal, Whitecaps reached 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
Nutshell - Kovalev's Winning Goal
The Canadians' favorite triad is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally Canadians won against Florida Panthers in 3:2 punitive shots last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec finished the match with two goals, and Kovalev finished the match with one goal, which was the fourth of the team's six preparation matches.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the split.
"I'm not ready yet," warns the Russian player.
"I need another game to really feel like I'm in shape."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first trimester," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the game's outcome.
He's got a huge ovation."
Charest's northern aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will begin this year
Just after the Liberal Party's meeting ended, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left) is going to win in the interim election to be held today.
"Repressing our last great northern border": this ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at yesterday's meeting of the Liberal Party of Quebec in Levis. The speech was also enriched with visual elements, while the president tried to focus on the point.
During his performance, behind his back, images like "Moulin à images" were shown.
On the three giant screens, impressive footage followed: dams of hydroelectric power plants, mining, Quebec on Google Maps, maps...
Such spectacular tools are used in election periods.
By the way, at the press conference, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth pillar of the "vision" of the Prime Minister regarding the future of Quebec, which is embodied in a "new economic area," which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several conventions designed with Ontario.
In recent times, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern area beginning at 49 degrees latitude) was often included in the Prime Minister's speeches, but he has never given a lecture on this subject.
However, the head of state was limited to explaining why he considered the North to be "a treasure mine full of great opportunities," but he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
It has highlighted only a few opportunities for development: primarily hydroelectric power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which is further stimulated by the growth of countries that are catching up and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north, "with nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," Charest said.
This area, which is "twice the size of France," is "our territory, Quebec.
Not only is it within us, but it is within us," the head of state reiterated, stressing that it is intended to create a national founding myth.
He emphasized that Quebec's development was largely defined by the relationship with the North: the golden fever in Abitibi, the design work in Quebec, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future!" he added, after taking a theatrical break to illustrate the huge map behind his back.
The North, located on 70% of Quebec's territory, also includes a part of Labrador, which Quebec has always demanded for himself, the Prime Minister said at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the Government," he said.
On the other hand, "in the light of climate change, we need to rethink our view of the North," the Prime Minister said, speaking of the northwest passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of Arctic ice.
According to the Prime Minister, occupying the territory in this new geopolitical environment is an important task.
What about the natives of the territory, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister said that the government of Quebec is paying particular attention to them and that the plan will benefit them, especially young people.
The two ministers of various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (later from Parti Québécoisungava) have already started negotiations with about 30 local communities.
The inter-ministerial committee led by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Ministry of Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role, has also begun its operation.
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of a large-scale meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they create a common vision.
The development of the North would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, system-based and environmentally friendly," the Prime Minister promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Just like the former liberals, we think differently: our aim is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the recurring topics of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election as party president on Friday.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard-Godbout dam.
"Our politicians, including Godbout, founder of Hydro-Québécet, Lesage, who implemented the silent revolution and the national expansion of hydroelectric power plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he also quoted another piece - true, conservative - namely the programme "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister between 1957 and 1963.
Regarding the plan for the dam of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric power plant, President Charest pointed out that the installation would be planned for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I plan to be there," he told his followers, and his statement was received by a loud applause.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which is also allowed by the law.
He emphasized, however, that his calendar was already full, as he took on tasks at the meeting of the Federal Council in China and at the Quebec-New York Summit.
The party meeting held at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the liberal president to express nationalist decisions, which were approved almost without thinking. This is mainly about the "constitutional aspirations": the liberal party particularly demands recognition of the "specific nature of Quebec" in the Constitution.
They also want Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian radio and telecommunications council, and these members have veto rights to make decisions in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, was sceptical about the main points of the Northern Plan.
Parti Québécois's leader, Paulina Marois, re-introduced the development policy in Northern Quebec, which was introduced by the Landry government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that came to power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they hadn't, we'd be much ahead of you today,' said Mrs Marois, in agreement with Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for the vote today in Jean-Talon.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"But we want this to be more than just a play," said Party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who had returned from his freedom today.
Leaves - A Disgraced Country
Last summer Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet, took the liberty of calling Louise Arbourt "Shame" of Canada.
In this way, to reproach a woman who has fought constantly for the truth and deserves all our admiration - it says a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is, therefore, our government, who, in some of the Western countries concerned alone, did not deliver his own citizen from the Guantánamo concentration camp.
This is the government that absolutely ignores the fact that Omar Khadr was a teenager at the time of the crimes he was charged with.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signature of the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and lets a child soldier suffer in inhumane conditions.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet theater while investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian lawyers' association demand Omar Khadr's return so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
And our government overlooks the torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed spiritually, and years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not aware of this right now, at present there is a sneaky destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy. "Democracy: Harper keeps saying this word, which from his mouth sounds merely like an empty voice.
So the time has come when morals no longer exist: they can arbitraryly beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen at the pleasure of a government leader who has so far been in a minority (and what else can come after 14 October...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found with a party that glorifys the Order, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is crushing the values of which our country owes its good name and dignity.
Dear Mr Toews, shame is this - don't look elsewhere.
Review - Barrick Gold Orwell's Speech
In the September 17th issue of Le Devoir, a letter was published from Patrick J. Garver, deputy president and CEO of the barrick gold mine in Canada.
Following Orwelli's discussion, Garver states that the world's largest gold producer has filed a six million dollar libel lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing company to initiate a so-called "public debate."
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in defamation lawsuits, is not based on the truth, but on the law.
It is not surprising that Garver was deeply silent about this fundamental difference.
Would it really be the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the book Noir Canada have to spend considerable money on defence and combat in an uneven fight where on the other hand there is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible resources from the mining industry.
Otherwise, in such an unequal struggle, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and to conclude a friendly agreement that not only silences the opposite, but also intimidates those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views in public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done differently, in Canada the debaters do not usually beat each other with sticks, but tell their thoughts.
Therefore, the mine should have opened its books and files and prepared for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying for independent research groups that could have shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public, and with one move, it's sweeping aside the applications and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate if he ignores the opinion of this public at the same time?
In the vice-president's mind, this word probably means only lawyers who have been paid handsomely, not the total population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowed down.
In a democratic state, even those who detract from others deserve freedom of speech.
But what Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that Noir Canada's authors and publishers are mostly supported by the public because it condemns the harsh procedure of the mine.
The public is ready to listen to Barrick and to make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilised arguments rather than through a lawsuit to silence for many. (In the context of the term "public debate," Barrick Gold recently called in writing the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal discussions, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are the building blocks of all democratic societies.
As a whole, the procedure denies the right to summon credible sources, something to debate the facts and their interpretation, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss matters that do not please the rich companies of today's world, who will take the liberty of doing so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, it could do so according to the scientific standards applied by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have been able to handle debates, disagreements and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's indiscretion shows that, contrary to his claim, he did not want to engage in a debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures that limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street Rescue - The Democrats and Republicans agreed
The leaders of the Bush government and Congress Republican and Democratic leaders finally reached an agreement yesterday on the economic rescue operation, which has been the largest plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The $700 billion American plan to contain the financial crisis that has been raging Wall Street for months still needs to be approved by the two Houses of Congress.
Key points of the plan: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public funds envisaged; new provisions to keep the number of houses booked for non-payments; access to the salaries of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
Henry Paulson, U.S. finance minister Nancy Pelosi, president of the U.S. House and Judd Gregg, the Republican congressman in the trial, announced the good news yesterday, just a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial ended.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush government.
"We have done everything we can to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," the Democrat MEP explained.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, there will be great shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans," said Republican MEP Judd Gregg.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, afraid that another failure would harm the mood of investors.
They gave you a deadline for the agreement until the stock market opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations too late were willing to agree, but they expressed that they were not happy that the situation had escalated to the end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama attributed himself to the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of house ownership or the payment of the heads of companies assisted by the state.
"When we ask taxpayers to take extraordinary steps because of the irresponsible nature of other people, it is not very welcome.
However, these steps are necessary," he observed on an American television programme.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another channel whether he would vote in favour of the proposed plan, he replied: "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I have read in broad lines is already apparent from the fact that it is something that we all have to digest and by which we can move on.
The possibility of doing nothing is simply unacceptable," he said.
According to the 700 billion-dollar plan, taxpayers' money would buy the questionable demands of American financial institutions, something at risk, unsellable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis initiated by the collapse of the real estate lounge, which led first to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgages) and then spread to other debt (trade) securities and finally to the freezing of liquid resources and the upheaval of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was failed by a group of Republican MPs last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain "poisoning" assets of companies in difficulty would rather be provided by the government than bought.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which provides that if the government has to bear losses under the programme for five years, it may levy new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a tranche of $250 billion would first be paid; this could be followed by an additional $100 billion if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of the remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by another vote.
In exchange for assistance, Washington will acquire a share in the subsidised companies, which will give him dividends on profits and which he can sell after the crisis has come to an end.
The Federal Government will be able to delay the seizure of real estate to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan and to set the maximum value of wages and severance payments to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The planrs would like the plan to be voted on by the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, the plan may still not be approved.
Yesterday, statements against the plan were repeated both among Republicans and Democrats.
"It is absolutely clear that Washington will not hear your voice," said the Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the financial committee of the House.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that would benefit taxpayers."
Brad Sherman, a Democrat who leads a small congressional group called the "sceptical faction," presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economic experts, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to ask Congress: do not hurry and examine carefully which way she chooses," said Sherman yesterday.
At the same moment in Europe, it was once again understood that this was a global crisis.
Following a crisis conference, the three Benelux states announced that they would nationalise part of the Fortis banking group in the amount of EUR 11.2 billion (US dollars 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its competitors on the brink of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (US dollars 2.9 billion) as a result of the crisis in secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With 85 000 employees, Fortis is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"It's not wasted money," said Dutch finance minister Wouter Bos yesterday.
"We gain the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is precisely something that depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be about to nationalise another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all of Bradford and Bringley's ongoing loans, of which real estate loans amount to £41 billion (US$75.5 billion).
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that they would buy up the British bank's subsidiaries and customers.
Bradford and Bringley, after Northern Rock, would be the second bank to be nationalised by the British government since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the acting idol
His beautiful azure eyes, some say, were his main trump card, others said he had a major weakness.
Did the charming American actor ever get rid of his daffodil mirror?
Yes and no.
His shyness, sensitivity, and innate talent also distanced him from the harsh style that is the real element of the great monsters of the art world.
But what a great career he has entered!
Paul Newman died of lung cancer on Friday at the Connecticut estate at the age of 83, one of the last icons of the American cinema.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he looked like, and who for a long time was a rival on the film screen. He was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable in his roles, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mixture of blood often results from extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of the American dream.
He didn't think much of himself, which only increased his merit.
In the early 1950s, he studied the drama of Yale University, and then at the Actor's Studios in New York, before the theater, television, and soon after the cinema exploded.
In addition to being a champion of civil rights, he won second place in 1979 as a racing driver in the 24-hour race in Le Mans. He was also considered a sex symbol, although he had been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we will never know what the downsides of the life of this mysterious, private, dedicated actor who hated the glamour of show-business are.
He was an honest man in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the movie fans: in his great roles we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
His life's work is reviewed by the seventh American art, and the cinema has been constantly changing for more than fifty years.
The charming cowboy of "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) are mixed in our memory, where we saw him in the processing of Tennessee Williams, entitled "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
From recent times (1990), we can remember him in the form of a sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is confronted with his old age by the fact that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
Paul Newman also had many other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Upstairs," the tempestuous criminal boxer Rocky Graziano gave an unforgettable performance. This role originally intended for James Dean - and taken over after his death - started Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Great Thing," which won the Oscar for the best film in 1973.
In Robert Rossen's brilliant film "The Swindler" (1961), he played a bitter, vindictive billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money."
Changing times, but always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like that.
The period of his career was marked by a change of ages.
Younger ones are mainly known for George Roy Hill's cult film " Ice Breakers" (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, a hockey team coach who works in unconventional ways.
His fans saw him in the "The Big Jump" recorded by the Coen brothers in 1994.
The line was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' film "The Way of Destiny," which was the last thing to appear in the role of an Irish mob boss.
Contrary to many cinema legends who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its glamour, glamour, and hypocrisy.
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier did not view it as a "live rebuttal of the underplay" without any sense of humor: according to him, his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newman, whose long time the film roles fell into his lap.
Yet, he played less often young and successful characters: rather, he formed figures living on the edge of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malicious, or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to restore with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less-known face: in his soul, he was truly coy and sensitive.
In 1968, she starred with her wife, Joanne Woodward, in the film "Rachel, Rachel," an adaptation of the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence.
In 1984 he commemorates Scott, his son, who died of drug overdose, with a quiet and sad film entitled "Harry and Son."
Yesterday, many of Newman's admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old comrade Robert Redford (with whom they played in "The Great Thing" and "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid") said with grief: "His presence made my life and the world better.
Generousness and joy of being: that was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor, whom we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent filmmaking and his criticisms of Hollywood's debauchery are obscured.
We've seen his face a lot of times, smiling on the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods, and he did it with a bad taste in his mouth, though he thought it was funny at the beginning.
However, the proceeds from such sales have always been transferred to the Foundation for Children with Disease.
Newman has never sat on his laurels; he has always remained committed to the profession.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote the following sentences: "Your father was always and unimaginably grateful for his lucky star.
It was a privilege for me to be here."
It is also our privilege to accompany such a brilliant and generous American artist in his career.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced at Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the prosecution of János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In particular, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud and other crimes, including counterfeiting, which cause material harm, which continue to be committed in a criminal organisation.
According to the prosecutor's office, the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the tasks were often confirmed by untrue invoices.
The state and municipal funds - approximately HUF 65 million - migrated in part into the cash register of the Young Left and in part into the pockets of some individuals.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the received tender money was taken on the basis of cost accounts that were not actually carried out and that the associations had never complied with the undertaking.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
For these, they purchased the bills in the yoga town market, and the circular stamps were manufactured on Kiskunhalas.
And the name of which companies to make the invoice, among other things, was the Balaton-Uplands Boulevard to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look at boarding houses and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, which was followed by invoices to be submitted for applications by the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour portfolio and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these were noted by István Lados with his partner, András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports needed to obtain the aid.
One of Lados' "study trips" was a brewery.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlags, in 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for the 90-person group of the Commissioner Pont Association.
However, according to the CEO, so many of them would not have been able to fit into the catering space at the same time.
Similarly, the bill issued to the Foundation for the Better Future - later together for the Third Millennium - in the summer of 2002 was filled with formal and substantive errors.
A bed and breakfast in Badacsonytomaj was only three bedrooms, more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, yet the bill was about one hundred thirty guests.
But the imaginative forms were exaggerated even when they marked Pigal Kft., which also serves hospitality, which, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not include documents relating to the Better Future and the name of Hoppá.
The head of the company, Győző Farkas told hvg.hu that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and showed him bills, he immediately knew that there were false documents.
"The stamp had the wrong name of our business and our tax number."
He added that besides the formal reasons, it was not correct that a hundred people were accommodated according to the bill, since they had a total of eleven rooms, which do not have so many seats.
Plus, the bill was for catering, and their restaurant hasn't been working for a long time.
The zealous account makers also did not follow up on the fact that the travel agency they looked up in Budapest only organizes foreign trips, so they botically designated travel in Hungary as a service in the cash account, which also did not match the company's accounting practices.
In addition, as it was found during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, even though travel activities to countries outside the European Union were VAT-free.
Among other things, the rate of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Better Future, as the service of the company is not charged by the specified 25 percent, but by the 15 percent VAT, and the employees of the hotel only issued a machine invoice, but the invoice was made by hand.
In addition, the "exhibitors' failed to account for the fact that a company was designated to carry out a road transport activity, as revealed by the prosecution's procedure, which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on investment advice.
In addition, it failed because of formal differences - inappropriate account format, not a real stamp - that the accounts of the Joint Foundation for the Third Millennium, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner's Point are false.
Just like Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehértó, whose representatives denied that the invoices had been issued by them.
For example, the counterfeiters did not pay attention to the fact that HIB Kft. in Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group of the Young City Association ate there, which is why, as we know, the company's liquidation commissioner denied that he had issued the paper.
Consciously Exposed
The other group of account issuers are those who were aware of the need to issue a fictitious invoice.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Foundation for Chance Budapest has issued an invoice for the Third Millennium Foundation for approximately four million forints.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab Ltd. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue a fictitious invoice.
He also worked with the Zuschlags, which is currently in liquidation, Biogate Kft., which in 2003 provided the Foundation for the Better Future, the Atlas Association and the Red Pine Association with invoices issued for roughly HUF 5 million, behind which there was no real economic activity.
Neither is there any cash flow, because the completed accounts were then turned down, but the organizations have forgotten to include it in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the invoice belongs to the defendants.
Thus, the delivery agent of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft. was Iván Kubatov, based in Budapest, dealing with fuel and vehicle trafficking.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer devices, worth approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the data of the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas Cash Investment Kft., which has been wound up since 14 September 2005.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that in the course of the investigation, Cubatov has admitted that he has issued an invoice in the name of Kft to Atlas, Hoppa and the Foundation for the Third Millennium Together, and that he has received their compensation.
At the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Fapari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies actually worked, which the defendant claimed was due to lack of work.
However, the companies benefited from it because, at the request of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who made the documents of the company's formations, he issued invoices on behalf of the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and the Y-Generation.
Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave the organisations 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The D.A.'s office believed that 10 percent of the amounts in the accounts and the VAT were the ones that hit Cubatov.
The man even used Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, these were manufactured for the Commissioner Pont's application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary submitted a tender to the public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, the Táncsics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not spent for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order to ensure that this is not known, five fictitious accounts received from Works Team Ltd. were submitted to TMA.
These bills were also found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei's office at the educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, like they did at the D.A.'s office, are likely to report on the process of making accounts.
It may be interesting most if the prime defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to blow the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak comprehensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in the interest of the socialists, or whether it is in the interest of the majority of the damage, for the reimbursement of HUF 50 million, and Zusi will take the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended today, since his requests to relieve the circumstances of his detention, that is to say, to put him under house arrest, were constantly found deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of far more damaging and non-refundable economic crimes can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the proceedings against them, he has no opportunity to do so.
The psychology of over-bidding: why are we giving out more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overestimate goods.
The neurological-economic foundations of this known and seemingly irrational behavior have been revealed by researchers at the New York University of Neurologists and economists.
According to their study published in Science magazine, people do not want to fall behind in a race such as eBay's auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research was trying to map this neurological pattern of play using experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other took part in a playful auction, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method was used to examine the active brain areas of the test subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which the over-bidding of the other party is an essential element - the striatum under-cortex complex was activated intensively when the game was lost.
In addition to several other functions, this brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise in the price can be explained by avoiding the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the economist of the research group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this, three groups bid against one partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was and they placed their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they came out of the game winning, they would be rewarded with another $15 worth of money.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 just before the auction, but the members of the group lost this money in the event of a losing auction.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that they emphasized the win for one of them and the loss for the other.
However, by proving the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team who played against "loss" were willing to bets higher than the control and "winner" groups.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
To date, they only explained the events at the auction with the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only neurological imaging methods have helped to resolve the contradiction between these two theories by giving us a third explanation now," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
There are hundreds of thousands of people infected with hepatitis at home, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because patients are often unaware that they are infected.
Hepatitis is a generic name for infectious liver diseases caused by different viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, characteristic of hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused are different.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (dondo, vaginal secretion, saliva).
In any case, travelers should be vaccinated against A and B viruses, and there is no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, accompanied by generally feeling unwell, weakness, abdominal discomfort, nausea.
After this, jaundice occurs on the skin and whites of the eyes, stools are clear, urine becomes dark, healing may take two to three weeks.
A million people worldwide die of the more serious disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected patients will receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can also lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected do not even know about the disease, because the pathogen insidiously kills the liver's cells, in many cases the first symptoms occur in 20-30 years.
Thus, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
In three groups, this disease is much more than average: between people who had had had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
The number of people infected with chronic hepatitis C in the world is currently estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease may already be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is worth contacting the general physician if any symptoms of unknown origin are detected.
Recognizing the disease in time can be cured, the virus can be eradicated from the body, thus eliminating infectiveness and preventing cancer.
30 September is the World Day for Hepatitis, which was held for the first time in 2004 by organisations representing patients around the world.
It aims to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, its causes and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent study, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller, which could have made the death of Catholic martyrs easier.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects people's sense of pain, reported British Telegraph.
In the framework of the rather bizarre study, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were electroshocked, while they all studied a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out much of the pain.
Thanks to the technique that scans the human brain, it was also revealed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for controlling pain.
The study is the first in a series of research that involves scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university, in addition to academics.
The investigation was carried out precisely by attaching a sparkly device to the left hand of the test subject, which provided electroshock.
Researchers asked the participants to take a strong look at two paintings, the picture of the Virgin Mary and Leonardo da Vinci, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century, with hermeline painted in the 15th century.
The investigators hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would create a religious state among believers, while the da Vinci picture was chosen because it was not too different from the other and thought it to be soothing.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during which time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive episodes while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
The Catholics reported that when they saw the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe" like they were "careful" and "relaxed, filled with peace."
While looking at the religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo's work was seen before you.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any powerful image, including atheists, only the right photo should be found.
"We should find a picture that they feel very positive about, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality," added Wright.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a similar-caliber painter showed a picture of a madonna to the believers, how would that affect their pain control?
Would the sight of the quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
Google can say on its tenth birthday: it is found in people's pockets as much as it is above their heads in the sky; it knows where they vacation, what specialties they go to and what they care about.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's top guys.
On the other hand, as far as skeptics parallel to Orwell's horror are concerned, they do not see the essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that the main goal of Google is to collect more personal data from their users, which is necessary in order to be able to adhere to the original goal of Google founders, which sounded "get all the world's information into the system."
According to the Google leader, the company is still at the very beginning of managing all the information after ten years of world subversive work.
The question of what will be in five years' time, Schmidt replied: would you like Google to be able to answer questions such as "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of work would really suit me?" - however, until then, software cannot answer such simple-looking questions because they do not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware of the exact location of searchwords during Internet searches, the IP address they were looking for and the site they left after the search.
With the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their own surfing background history, look back at what they were looking for, what they clicked on, and thus generate much more personalized hits in the long run - Recommendations will be based on the same logic that the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they look at what I do? - Users ask if they're worried about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the potential power represented by the company can be scary rather than guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or rebellion against power in Internet users.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the requested terms are not only recorded, but can be transferred to third parties if justified, and in such legal cases, the privacy of Internet users is protected by nothing.
The loudest example of this was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information about paedophiles on the social site Orkut, which it maintained, to enable identification.
However, Internet users concerned about personal rights could still sigh in May, when the company, in cooperation with the EFF electronic legal protection organisation, successfully proved its point in court against the FBI: Google could not be forced to provide any information requested by the FBI in secret at any point in the Constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully fought out about 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search terms, which were obtained by reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act adopted years earlier, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and to obtain a complete list of websites and keywords covering two months.)
Google's view is therefore quite contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the provision of their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and privacy are being undermined by the fact that they are starting to use Google's services and act against them with a rebellion that has spread to multi-company companies in conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American Geek culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users in many countries see in them the next generation of large companies, "cool breeding," as opposed to its rival Microsoft, who is world conqueror because of Windows, no matter how much they both struggle for the same goal.
This may happen because Google does not ask its users for an identification code other than Microsoft, does not ask for money for its applications, the open, free, constantly kept source code and program package is much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software giant exercise.
However, it may also occur that the Geeks have a clear understanding of the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which was followed by the web 2.0, one of the most frequently said key words in recent years.
The web 2.0 is about collaboration, about deliberately leaving clues and taking advantage of the communication channels available to us, and while the scale of these changes varies from individual to individual, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average youth can create a profile from Facebook to Xanga on several social media sites, linking them to other services such as Twitter or last.fm listing his musical habits, and then connect them to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also create a blog that automatically features the latest photo galleries that are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about a number of exemplary cases from which we can see: the girlfriend can easily discover the morning photos of the common circle, seeing who her cheating friend spent the evening with or who she could fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion about senior management in her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has now been completely revalued.
If you live an online life, it's what you show yourself, and it's how you use it to define the basic principle behind the behavior of young people today.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least avoid the Google Monopoly, can do it (starting with Scroogle, for example, using Google's search system, but not deliberately leaving a trace).
For example, the number of people who do not intend to register on social media to be unable to find them can be replaced by alternative versions of Google's online apps from the text editor to the image manager and newsreader, which are not connected to giant server parks and which do not form the best profile that has ever existed.
Public opinion isn't so secretly waiting for Google to show its teeth.
With the current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten advertising agencies' revenues, and services introduced at an accelerated pace cause serious headaches not only for Microsoft but also for many other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the counterpoints that are disturbing: for example, the senior management completely rejected the opposition of employees, after doubling the company's kindergarten fee, the management found that the daily meals of employees were too expensive, but all of them dwarfed by the fact that Google had bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and that they agreed that the company would filter out any hits that would violate good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that they do not announce a new service in advance, only when it can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some people believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archive project is taking on such an extent that the company will soon face the Supreme Court of America, others will be terrified of the Health system, in which we can build a full health profile of ourselves with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can also provide good material for the next generation of science fiction writers, the popular Cory Doctorow novel, Scroogled dot Orwelli overtones describing the future in which a person can only approach an alarmingly well from Google's data.
Two juveniles helped the Ozdian double killer with the cover-up.
Two juveniles were questioned by the police on the Ozd double murder case, who, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to cover the tracks of the crime, said the spokesperson of the Borsod County Police Department on Tuesday.
Young people have acknowledged their burden and are currently accused of abetting them.
The two minors - according to MTI information, two girls - are on the loose.
Prosecution can be punishable by imprisonment of up to five years.
The suspect in the Ozd dual murder - a 23 - year - old local man - was placed under pre-trial arrest on Sunday.
He's suspected of premeditated, profit-seeking, multiple manslaughter.
The investigation revealed that the 23 - year - old young man owed a larger amount to a 53 - year - old man.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so he lured his creditor to an Ozd location last Wednesday, where he killed him, and then the man's nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, which is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun hidden at the scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - some five billion Czech kroner - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to buy a 100% share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer that the Poles made despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange had previously been excluded from the new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in public hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of the paper in a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 knows that the Polish offer is the highest amount that so far has been offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, so far the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted bids.
Petr Koblic, chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out that this could lead to the liquidation of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner by market experts.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a 25% share, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of the European newspaper
The European papers leading in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the ever-increasing international financial crisis already refer to "11 September."
We owe the global financial disaster to the US President - the Roman President La Repubblica accuses us - the president was not even able to line up his own party behind the bill, which was put together in a hurry to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the media in Madrid see the scapegoat in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The threat of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan wasn't perfect, but after the Congressional vote, Washington is in danger of offering no political means of dealing with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, says Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states can now still provide rescue belts to supporting financial institutions and save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like domino cubes, neither funds nor other improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to overcome their national selfishness and to centralise the control of fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was allocated to the failing financial institutions - recalls Der Standard in Vienna, which says that the concerns that European taxpayers, like Americans, have to put their hands deep in their pockets in order to remedy the crisis are becoming increasingly realistic.
The EU has not yet seriously addressed the crisis, which is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
"Saviors" do not need to start waving hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good to record: in which case it is reasonable to use taxpayers' money to prevent more damage.
The flight of the bumblebee is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision if not to mimic obstacles in the natural world?
Bees, for example.
In the surprising project presented at CATEC in Japan, the bee has given Nissan engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In cooperation with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C bio-implanted car robot control system, a robotic minicar that has been provided with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate aim of facilitating the development of a system that eliminates all collisions.
During flight, every bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety shield, explained Kazuhiro Doi, technological PR and R &amp; D brand director at the exhibition.
Its role is important for the complex eye of the uterus, which can see in all directions at more than 300 degrees of vision.
To copy the complex eye function, the engineers reached out to the idea of a laser telemeter.
This identifies obstacles within a 2 m range of 180 degrees before BR23C, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an action to avoid collision.
Within a fraction of the second, the obstacle is detected, and then the car robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid collision.
In any way other than the current system, this avoidance maneuver takes place in a completely instinctive manner.
"If that were not the case, the car robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Andoh Toshiyuki, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology is the most vulnerable and inner layer of the safety shield, a layer within which the collision is currently considered unavoidable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in the blink of an eye.
However, in a way other than bees, the deviation should not be directed upwards, downward or diagonally, only two-dimensional and only towards the rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibility for bees to avoid other bees, they used only rotating motion and acceleration and slowing down as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means that they have a longer life span than lithium ion.
According to Andoh, an intuitive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, even less to store it.
This device will only have to process and react to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory continuously.
There's no need for gigabyte or megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate avoidance technology, which, according to Nissan's estimation, could enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
The assembly of the unit with the GPS-satellite navigation system may provide additional application to guide the driver to the specified destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
There's a name for the expensive kid.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law for the purchase of banks' bad loans in several instalments has been completed.
In the first round, half of the money is spent.
During the further talks that took place after midnight on Saturday, Eastern Coast Time, congressional leaders came to an agreement in the day - long debate around a total of $700 billion rescue package, reports Reuters.
"We have made great progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who said that all that remains is to be written.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson stated that the programme will work and be effective, but there is also a need for further work. Pelosi said that this is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the cycle of the economy around.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday evening (i.e. Monday morning at two o'clock in Central European Time), but did not cause a spectacular rise in the skins.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft of the Act on the programme, which is called the Economic Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, and then it will be the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesperson of the White House.
Otherwise, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush Administration, which would have meant that the $700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of low-quality debt securities.
Now, for the first time, up to half of the 700 billion will be spent using 250 billion immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, from which the Ministry of Finance buys low-grade securities with credit background, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the president's decision.
The program will be monitored by a separate body, which will be attended by the president of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on another decision of Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use combined tactics: it can buy bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time and other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase can take place in the framework of auctions and directly - the Ministry's authorities have stated.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme, where the financial portfolio guarantees the means of concern for which companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means to meet the urgent needs of the US financial system of up to $700 billion, whether it is about the widespread purchase of bad assets, whether it is about their insurance or the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, heads of banks in distress and awaiting state aid can expect the government to limit their exit money, which the overseas slang simply calls a golden parachute.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on the way the Ministry of Finance provides assistance.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys an auction, an extra tax is levied on the golden parachute, unless the senior bank leader is retired.
When buying bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not excessive.
The picture includes that existing gold parachute contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first time in American history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs - commented the President of the House's Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank of the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State acquires the right to acquire, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win the transaction once the economy and the rescued bank recovers.
The draft law states that, over the next five years, the President will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were some who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, i.e. not protect taxpayers' dollars, said the Republican representative Darrell Issa of California.
His Democratic colleague in Ohio, Mary Kaptur, believed that the actions were being promoted by the same people responsible for Wall Street's collapse.
Industrial prices continued to rise
The domestic sales prices of industry increased by 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared to the previous month by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007, reports KSH.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1 per cent higher than in July 2008, with a decrease of 3.9 per cent compared to one year earlier.
As a result of domestic and export price changes, industrial producer prices were 0.7 per cent higher than the previous month and 3.2 per cent higher than the previous year.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only minimally by 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing sectors also increased slightly by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The highest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8 percent), mainly due to the 4,6 percent increase in the production of bags, straps and a 2.5 percent monthly increase in footwear production.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical and product manufacturing sector (1.6 percent).
Price reductions occurred in the oil processing (1.4 percent), electrical machinery, instrument production (0.9 percent) and wood processing (0.1 percent) sectors, to a minimum.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In other manufacturing sectors, we measured price increases of between 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In August prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, which represents a significant weight in domestic sales of industry, increased by 0.3 percent, mainly due to the prolonged impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In 12 months' comparison, prices in the oil processing sector increased to the highest extent (32.4 percent) in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing sectors.
In the fabricated products sector, there was an 11 percent increase in food, drink and tobacco production, representing a significant weight, of 13.2 percent.
Price reductions occurred in the textiles, textile products (2.5 percent) and electric machinery and instruments (0.3 percent) sectors.
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of increase was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.
Prices have increased by 10.2 percent over the last year in the manufacturing industry as a whole.
The prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector exceeded 18.7 percent a year earlier.
Domestic sales showed the highest monthly price increase in the capital goods manufacturing sectors (0.7 percent) in August, among the sectors for which they are intended.
In consumer goods manufacturing sectors, prices have increased by 0.3 percent and prices in energy and downstream sectors have not changed compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, the highest price increase compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in energy and downstream sectors (18.6 percent).
In the consumer goods manufacturing sectors, we measured an increase in prices of 6.8 per cent and a decrease in prices of 1.4 per cent for capital goods.
The export sales prices of the industry in HUF increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3.9 percent in 12 months comparison.
In one month, our currency in Hungary weakened by 1.7 percent compared to the euro and 7.1 percent compared to the dollar, compared to August 2007, by 7.5 percent compared to the euro and 15.9 percent compared to the dollar.
Next year, you don't need a visa for the United States?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January - the Foreign Minister spoke about this in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "it is now almost all about whether the electronic entry and control system is being built overseas in time."
At the same time, he pointed out that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but that tourists would have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will negotiate in Washington from today.
He meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary will award the Star and hold talks with foreign policy advisors of the Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
The bank rescue package includes Barack Obama and McCain.
Both Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidate of the two major American parties, supported the government's $700 billion bank rescue package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the Minister of Finance's resignation.
After days of marathon negotiations, congress and administration representatives announced at dawn on Sunday, an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to thaw the frozen credit market have become central to the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain both claim to be more competitive than their rival in leading the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest polls, Obama once again took advantage of economic issues, which he gained after the Republican convention, with Sarah Palin's nomination as vice president.
At a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that the law on the 700 billion-dollar package would quickly be passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included the consumer protection sections that he supported.
"We must act now, we must take responsibility... for your job, your savings, industries as a whole, the stability of the entire economy is at risk," he said in front of the 35,000-dollar crowd.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic ideas outdated.
McCain explained in his interview to ABC that "we will all find this difficult to swallow (...) but doing nothing simply cannot be done."
The Republican senator said that the proposal included the setting-up of a committee to supervise the finance minister and the limitation of the termination of the top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives would hopefully vote on the bill by Monday.
The German language section
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp the voters became more self-conscious - thus Der Spiegel analyses the weak role of CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent the Red and Black Coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the German news magazine on the left, Franz Walter, the revolution of Bavaria, is eating up his parents in his article on the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a known polythologist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over.
For decades, Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria - and these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of era is also the problem of the entire Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising to CSU, but on Sunday a process ended, which was likely almost exactly ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of a state party ceased.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s, below the 50 percent level.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was mentioned in the Stoiber era.
This is due to the constant modernisation carried out by CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but at the same time they were wrong. However, there were no consequences for the CSU's loyalty to secularization, educational achievements, the resettlement of the East and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can be seen.
The right-wing camp is untouched, only within the camp the electorate became more self-conscious, critical, more stubborn.
It is also striking that in the last few weeks, the classic civic groups were most distant from CSU; they were free-lancers, industrialists, graduates and graduates.
Here, CSU's support has been reduced to less than 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Viennese newspaper's article entitled "Who, Who? Party Presidents on Modest Coalition Issues" deals with the confused domestic political situation that emerged after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not yet want to agree on the coalition.
The election took place, and now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, party leaders hardly allowed access to their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann has confirmed that he intends to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer - with the current ÖVP president as Vice Chancellor - was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted out anyway.
Repetition of this direction is not an option.
Molterer responded carefully to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in the ÖVP internal affairs.
The fact that his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is still completely open to the party, the issues must be discussed within the ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has repeatedly shown himself open in all directions.
"In order to prevent the Red-Black Coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: Breaking the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
The European Equal Opportunities Summit in Paris started today, hosted by France, representing the Presidency of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesz representative of the European People's Party, in her message to the plenum as one of the main speakers of the professional conference, drew attention to educational segregation, because this is one of the most serious violations affecting Roma children and, moreover, this is the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The high-level conference, on behalf of the French Presidency, was opened by Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most important European rights defenders and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities were invited to the meeting.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz EP Group, warned that, in addition to the discrimination in recruitment, the Roma mainly need to leave the labour market because of their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education, and only a small proportion of them can obtain higher education as a result of low quality primary education."
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the broadest possible way, including between Roma and non-Roma.
The sooner the Roma student starts school, the more opportunities she has to become a productive member of the labour market; they contribute to the national budget through taxes on income and consumption.
"Romas should be guaranteed the right to quality education and the elimination of their low quality and separate education in the right of EU citizenship," said Lívia Járóka.
According to the Member, the aim and action-oriented cooperation of the European Union is necessary to speed up the dissegregation processes in schools immediately, and it is essential to ensure that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly enforced.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities of democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," said Járóka.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held annually since last Berlin, aims to provide a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo will be decided.
Despite the nasty election failure, heads have not yet fallen, and at the peaks of the Bavarian CSU the discussion of personal issues has been postponed.
Party President Erwin Huber and Provincial Prime Minister Günther Beckstein may remain in place, questioning how long the pardon will last.
The fate of the 17 percent catastrophic tandem will be decided by an extraordinary party convention on the last weekend of October.
In any case, the members of the highly criticized couple felt that they did not stick to their seats with all their strength.
They tried to calm down the angry members of the faction and the base, who, one day after the "bajor tsunami," demanded personal consistency over the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, with Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career, the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they only had 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU has been a "single ruler" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
Although conservatives remain high in the southern region of the Hungarian economy, they will definitely be forced to coalition in the future.
As one of the first signs of reorganization within the Party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister of Agriculture, who is the potential successor of Huber, will also be included in the narrow reconnaissance team that will start soft negotiations on a possible government coalition in Munich with liberal FDP and Free Elections on Right-wing Values.
Fate's odds are that the Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was exploited by Huber-Beckstein as a coup and then brutally dealt with by the ambitious municipal politician, is included in the Liberty Elections list.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, Stoiber, the former head of state and former CSU President, who had been behind the strings, called the 28th of September the bitterst day of his political career, will also be actively involved.
On Monday, Huber made some epic remarks to the CDU, and he said that they deserved much more support from the brothers and sisters.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
Following the election of Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel cannot be a chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in the national success in 2005, is somehow not put back on its feet together.
According to Merkel, the failure of the fiasco to disguise him, the loss of the CSU's soil will not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
Of course, this is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the social democrats' crisis will continue.
SPD has achieved 18,6 percent of its weakest result since 1946 in Bavaria.
Lukashenka's enemy: 110-0
None of the opposition representatives made it to the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the prosperity and stability of the country led by Aleksandr Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the lawlessness committed at the time of the count.
The OSCE sending 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although 10 million people's legislation has been lacking the opposition for many decades, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, called the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ), sincerely hoped that, following the amendment of the Constitution, Lukashenko, who renewed the mandate of President for the fourth time in the 2006 debates of purity elections, would allow some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament.
The ODSZ has thus also stopped the boycott that had been weighed in advance.
In view of opposition expectations, Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia, has taken credit for reducing the ever-expanding Russian gas imports and has also contributed to the Russian handing in of Beltransgaz gas pipelines across the country, sought to improve its relationship with the EU, where, due to the political arrangement in Belarus, which has been declared anti-democratic, Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians are not allowed to enter.
It referred to a preliminary relief that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, focused more on positive movements than on shortcomings, such as banning a third of opposition candidates from departure.
However, the OSCE's quick report on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which opposition candidates were essentially not allowed to appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the count of votes.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is still a noticeable improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to confront Moscow in a smaller way, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkázia who are separated from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus has been forming a federal state on paper, has considered the two areas independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step backwards, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Alexander Milinevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the Presidential elections in 2006, it is desirable that this be maintained, despite the fact that "power was afraid of allowing even one opposition into a weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan protest actions in view of the results, but rather seeks to deliver a message on the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
"We have a lot of problems with this, of course," said Milinevich, referring to the fact that the regime of Lukashenko, which regards the establishment of social security as its main achievement, does not seem to be suitable even for the most officially supported pensioners.
"The country's debt, due to the increase in the trade deficit, is a matter of time before the breakdown of social security "invoking the silence of the graveyard," said Milinevich.
As opposed to the opposition politician, Russian observers declared the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Community of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency in Ria Novoszty that "people don't believe words, they believe actions," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Morning only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, rotating doors were installed for the entry and entry of workers.
From this day forward, this new measure will be put in place against the craftsmen, to filter out those who block, and then go out for a coffee at work.
The anti-theft novelty was presented today by Minister of Public Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The turntables," said Brunetta, "are intended for better and more efficient work, reducing gaps and increasing services."
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform," said Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace completes all the facilities of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "the installation of rotary gates is also symbolically important."
There was no resistance from employees, the secretary-general said: "The workers approved the measure, everyone cooperated."
So breakfast is over on the clock, no more coffee and no more brioche.
Brunetta, smiling, advises: "A good cappuccino at 7:00 in the morning, capable of miracles."
At the Roman Administrative College
At the meeting, the Minister explained: "in three months, the absences of public sector workers due to illness decreased by 50 percent, which means 60 000 more workers in one year."
At the same time, he added that the Italian administration should be made more efficient
"which, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector in the last 8-10 years and well above the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of civil servants have gathered to join the submission supported by the Italian Association for the Environment and Consumer Protection to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Administration boasts data to support the reduction of the absences due to the disease, the army of 'fearless lurkers' continues to grow," says the consumer association.
All over Italy, thousands of honest and hardworking administrative staff have gathered to declare war on the illegal provisions of the regulation."
The regional administrative court shall, inter alia, challenge the abolition of supplementary sickness benefits for reasons of service, the extension of the residence period of workers on sick leave, which shall mean the period within which the patient may appear and other aspects of the new provisions imposed by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is more important than anything else
Every day in Italy there are 2,500 accidents at work, out of which 3 end in death and 27 end in permanent disability.
According to the accident insurance company at work, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and it takes almost twice as many victims as manslaughter.
Today, Anmil organises for the 58th time in all counties of Italy, the day of victims of accidents at work traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, to draw the attention of institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data reported by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of the last few days, confirm that prevention in accidents at work has an extremely important role to play," stated President Giorgio Napolitano in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, president of the National Association of Accidents at Work.
The head of state warmly praised the "consistent commitment of the association to workplace prevention, the protection of the interests of workers affected by accidents, the support of family members of the victims and the inclusion of public opinion."
"Surely, and honestly shared by everyone, these kinds of tragedies, which, due to their size, arouse the interest of the media and the public, are causing an outrage, but in reality we face dramatic, repeated and repeated cases every day."
Napolitano openly admits: "We are undoubtedly struggling with a lack of resources, financing education and information is crucial.
Within-school initiatives aimed at direct information for young people on the threshold of entry into the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to allow attention to be lost in terms of the social importance of the issue, and to have more effective legislation that must be enforced.
The President of the House of Commons, Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed "how serious accidents at work that result in death are of social importance to all our consciences and require the institutions to put an end to this as soon as possible."
"The data on accidents at work show slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still incredibly high," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of Anmil.
"However, we do not want this downward trend to be combined with decreasing attention, because the greatest tragedies occur when attention is fading."
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be achieved through a complex action programme.
We believe that more stringent supervision and control would be needed - stressed Mercandelli - as well as more robust intervention in the field of labour training, starting with school education."
"Further efforts are also needed to inform the public and make it more sensitive," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employers' environment against a phenomenon that is a social problem."
After that, Mercandelli criticised "the gradual deterioration of the safety net for victims of accidents at work" and the "aid trend towards which the system has been drifting in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to give back to workers the safety of insurance, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on the lawmakers' arbitrary and sometimes handing out measures."
MP3 players can cause hearing damage
Longer and high volume listening to portable players such as MP3 devices can cause permanent hearing loss
published in Brussels on the basis of the opinion published today by the European Commission, the new and newly identified Scientific Committee on Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The opinion shows that 5-10 percent of those who listen to their portable music player for more than one hour per day for five years can suffer permanent hearing loss," says the explanation.
"It is worrying that young people who mass and often use high volume portable music players and mobile phones are unaware that they can irreversibly damage their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific surveys indicate an indisputable risk that we urgently need to respond to," the EU Commissioner added.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this.
In the light of this opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can work properly and keep pace with the latest technologies."
Brussels invited the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise.
"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine possible measures for the protection of children and minors exposed to noise from portable players and similar devices," he concluded.
The current European Safety Regulation sets maximum noise levels for portable music players at 100 dB, but there is an increasing concern about hearing loss resulting from excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution that can significantly reduce these hearing losses.
The scientific opinion of the EU Scientific Committee states that for users of portable reproducing apparatus who listen to music at high volume (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise pollution exceeds the maximum currently in place for noise at work.
If you listen to music for a longer time in similar circumstances, after five years there is a risk of permanent hearing loss.
This affects about 5-10 percent of people who use portable devices, which could represent 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno sets up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, ends in March, results are expected in June.
This is the agenda set by the Metropolitan Municipality for the operation of the Committee on the Future of the Capital of Rome, which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Committee members will draw up guidelines for Rome.
Following the end of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the general meeting and in the municipal committee in order to present in June the capital strategy plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"This is a completely independent committee in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented, and Alemanno emphasizes, and its task is to draw up proposals for Rome's development ideas on which policy makers, such as the Assembly and the Municipal Committee, can rely.
There is no conflict of jurisdiction, we just wanted a platform where great plans could be made for the benefit of Rome.
In March, after he has completed his work, the committee will be dissolved because he has a fixed term of office.
In June we will present a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of the Capital of Rome, the Mayor said.
To those who consider the Commission to be redundant on the grounds that the opinion it has set up is not binding, Alemanno answers: "It all depends on what work the Commission will do and on the quality of proposals it puts on the table.
If the quality proves to be adequate, as will the Attali Committee in France, which I take for granted in Rome, its contribution will have an important role to play.
The power of politics is often fragmented in the handling of daily affairs and in the handling of urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we look further, taking into account the perspective, and plan for a longer term and are committed to working towards the development and future of Rome."
The Mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be regarded as a useless "waterhead" because it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome any euro, but it will serve as an incentive to think and aim to involve the finest minds in the capital."
According to Alemanno, "there is a need for an open-ended and flexible strategic framework plan that allows our city to jump to the standard that it so desperately needs, thinking in a united spirit about its future."
The future on which the mayor of Rome stresses that "it will not only be limited to the current municipal framework but also look much further away" is not only the future metropolis and capital status, but also "the role that it can and must fulfil as the capital of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean."
The first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well - known American politician, who claims to be independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, destroyed the American economy and had close relations (as he does today as a private person) with enemy Islam."
As the election time approaches, the attacks on Obama are increasing.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: "This man is full of ambition.
Obama, in a brazen way, believes that he can gain the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far had two governors and five senators in black!"
These attacks are actually meaningless; of course, they are racist, but they do not answer the voters' question of whether they will be a good president, and then there are polls: they indicate that Obama will win, with a significant presence.
In this case, there's someone who listens to his emotions, not his brain.
Inside the South States, a newspaper in Mississippi wrote in its editorial: We know well who the true American patriot is voting for in the polling room.
There appears a side of American thinking that remained hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where to put the ics on Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this reasoning, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked about the mistakes that were made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation has lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam and has been kicked in the butt by flying home.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
Yet, the majority believe that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
There's a huge task for George W. to take over.
The United States: the economic collapse is felt by journalists, and the time has come for restrictions in editorial offices. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW research institute asked 500 American journalists how they felt about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost every journalist is a pessimist about his future.
However, they did not clearly claim that their concern for credibility had diminished.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
The problem of American journalists is money.
They believe that the 2008 crisis is a failure of a weak economic model.
Another serious problem is the restrictions on the newsroom, or newspaper-making editorials.
If we do not want traditional journalism to shrink to a minimum in the sense that the general public means, this problem must be solved, says the journalists interviewed.
Today, American journalism is characterised by a clearly visible and complex pessimism.
Sixty percent of journalists and top executives working in print press are convinced that national law enforcement is on the wrong track.
At local level, 65% of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
It's no problem for the press to see where the web is going.
The biggest publishers are making their way to the Internet, which many people consider to be the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists surveyed admitted that they voted alongside technology in the hope that it might benefit the public sector.
Today, in American press, there is a gap between editorial leaders, i.e. directors, and correspondents working for them.
At national level, 56 percent of the leaders are confident that their correspondents share information with others, while at local level this ratio is only 23 percent.
Some people link this to the safe place of work.
At national level, 47 percent of the leaders are afraid of losing their jobs in three years.
For journalists, this rate is 30 percent.
In America, the question of "secure work" is on the agenda at team level (in the case of our editors, ed.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a nation as large as the United States with 300 million inhabitants, with thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet service providers, employers usually offer as much as they want, so it works on a "need or don't have to."
Directors usually receive high salaries, and editors can earn $10,000 a month, in addition to the salary for pensions and health insurance.
Freedom, on the other hand, operates on a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, in the third year, too, until after a certain period of time it reaches the maximum 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own admission, often get "sick" during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
UNIPOL: ROME COURT: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Penalty Division of the Roman Court, rejected Danilo Coppola's application for a residence in the real estate sector, who wanted to visit a Roman residence from Grottaferrata.
Coppola is being investigated for economic bankruptcy in the context of an investigation into an agreement on the exchange of shares with Unipol - BNL.
Last week, in the course of the proceedings against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to an exit ban on Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate specialist be allowed to visit his apartment in Budapest from the small rural town.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor has proposed rejecting them) would allow the company's affairs to be affected and access to the evidence against it.
Elite in Danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House did not vote in favour of the $700 billion rescue package presented by the White House: most Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that the current crisis has led to a break in the Republican Party, which is showing an increasing division between the traditional, restrained Eastern coastal attitude to support federal institutions and business circles and the new anti- Washington and financial direction that is growing in the Central and Southern states.
This line was expressed critically in the House vote mentioned in the introduction.
However, this event is just one of the major changes that the economic restructuring that is still taking place allows us to anticipate or see, not only in the United States, but in the whole Western world, and perhaps even outside.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, is only accelerating the long-standing phenomena that have been solidified in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is re-activation, bringing the dual category of state sovereignty back to the public in relation to a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking and financial institutions which, while having a close relationship with the rest of the world, are primarily and fairly widespread, bringing with them people and families living in one country, one state.
This, in turn, is a direct political problem for those on the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also voters.
Thus, the crisis seems to be global in economic terms, but in political terms it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of line: the European Union is an eloquent proof of this, which cannot establish a uniform political direction between different interests and different national strategies.
Thus, everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but especially the opening up of funds: because, in a difficult situation, only the individual states have economic resources, a financial stock that may be able to make things right.
They have both the means and the power to use them: they have two invaluable resources, which no other market and no international organisation will possibly have at any time to such an extent.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on nation state is fully in line with the fact that recent economic growth attaches increasing importance to a factor that is closely linked to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly had to realize that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were, in the least, abstract, such as water, crops and oil.
From things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, they are wholly linked to a confined location, an area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more cards than the one who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil, and no water.
I'd like to move on to the second novelty, which suggests a kind of fault line.
Who says territory, state, government, necessarily says politics, in other words leadership.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two interrelated phenomena:
On the one hand, the objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is someone who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially economic leaders, has brought about a total loss of credit, who have proved completely inadequate and demonstrated that many areas are still blurry.
Together, the two are even more important and, in a sense, more disturbing: a sense of lack of credit, intolerance, inadequacy and separation, which affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that the belief in the wider population is that the social elite's time until now is over. It has expired before they have made their actions, their experiences, their way of life, their culture, their own in the complex sense of the word. This makes the social elite increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, in a covert form, feeds a wide-ranging but strong delegation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This is reflected in the unexpected "insurrections" of voters, or in the sudden changes in the public mood in recent times. For example, the rise of conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Union in Britain, or the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps also the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, together with its parties, programs, and even its customs, press and prestigious intellectuals, are becoming less and less aware of what has been happening for some time in the deeper layers of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is growing, spreading, and is potentially capable of causing ever-increasing anger.
Nevertheless, talking about "the imminent rebellion of the masses" would, frankly, be exaggeration.
But keeping an open mind is not bad at all.
We can wear super-strong glue on the wall.
With a super-strong glue to beat gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This is the goal that has been set by several US research centres, and a group of four institutions is close to a solution.
With a piece of glue of only 2.5 square centimeters, researchers managed to glue and hold a 100-pound body to a vertical wall.
THE American journal Science published the findings of some researchers at Dayton University, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology, and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the group of scientists was born from the further development of already existing, special, new, carbon nanotube-structured materials.
"The principle of glue must be imagined as a pipe system similar to a packet of spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers drew the idea from the gecko's microscopic folds, which gives the animal perfect grip.
Tests with various materials such as glass, teflon and sandpaper have confirmed that the new glue is ten times more effective than the soles of the said reptiles, but is "lightly detached from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher at Dayton University's engineering department.
"This material can be useful as a temporary adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe so, but the researchers are thinking more of a less impressive use, like connecting electronic devices, because the carbon nanotubes drive heat and electricity well.
You can find additional applications in space exploration.
Superheroes can wait.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - the University of Berkeley, California, is experimenting with a new adhesive.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society magazine, scientists in California have presented a hairy microfiber adhesive that undergoes self-cleaning during movement on the surface, thus ensuring perfect grip.
No juice!
Care should be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These high-vitamin-containing, mainly popular in the summer, thirsting drinks, if they are added together with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption by increasing or reducing their effect, as the case may be. This may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario of London, pointed out the risks of the combination of canned or fresh fruit juices and certain medicinal products. The professor announced at 236 national meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice was already on the defendant's bench when it was found that it was able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, pacemakers, and neuromedicines to levels that could be considered toxic.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Pharmaceutical Institute itself published the news in its official bulletin and warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with such co-administration and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or methadone.
GRAPEFRUIT IS NOT the only one - According to researchers, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances whose absorption is hindered by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be listed.
Michele Carruba, professor of pharmaceuticals at the University of Milan, draws attention to this: "Such discoveries are usually immediately signalled to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutions, who, if necessary, will ensure that they change the information contained in the product.
That is why you should always read the information about the medicine you are about to take, and if something is not understood, let us not influence ourselves, but ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly," said Ansa Institute's specialist.
Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics
American Paul Krugman was awarded the Nobel Prize for Economics for analysing the territorial context of commercial models and economic activity.
55-year-old neokeynean Krugman, teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the strongest critics of the Bush government's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman in his editorial published in the New York Times predicted that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the twin towers.
This forecast has caused quite a few debates, and has repeatedly been thrown into the eyes of the economist, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I'm surprised, and I'm a little shocked at how quickly the public interest overstepped the scandalous collapse of Enron or Worldcom," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "roppant valuable economist" and, at the same time, "promoting his criticisms of the excessive liberalism of the Bush government in a rather aggressive style."
Open Office, third edition was also worth the anti-Microsoft package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0's open-label application package, which targets more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from liberal professions to public administration, will be released.
After almost a year of work by SUN Microsystem-supervised and volunteer developers, the new Open Office presents a number of novelties to the public: besides the welcome screen and the redesigned, less Spartan user interface, it offers several important novelties, such as compatibility with Apple Mac OS X and supports the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format according to ISO standard.
Special attention has been paid to compatibility with Office 2007 so that Open Office can also open new Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting is also the specific function of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint displays. This may be useful for sending files by email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphics module by keeping the page layout.
On the same interface, you can create "hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editing elements.
Sharing within applications has also undergone a number of improvements: the spreadsheet supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents the overwriting of each other's work. Each employee's comment is marked in a different color, which helps to facilitate identification during the verification phase.
Some companies are already working to make some of the features of OpenOffice available from the Internet (on the cloud, on the cloud), so the final version is likely to be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version, which has been on the Mirror sites since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html
In addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems, the program package is also available for Linux.
On request, we can take over the installation CD at our home or at our workplace.
Freeness is probably the biggest attraction for the expansion of the application at home, but the Open Office program package is now trying to kick the ball in the business sector, as it can count on a number of administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of ideal education, counselling and service services for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business horizons.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, text editor corresponding to Word; Calc, spreadsheet manager to replace Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentation; Dbase is the best-known, Access database manager; and finally Draw is the graphical module.
The 2008 goal is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, if you consider that the new version is up to 3,600,000, this number will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, it's the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of the Tour de France, one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, who competed in the colours of the Gerolsteiner team, won the best T-shirt in addition to the bronze medal.
The news came out on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, the Italian Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepol, and the German Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who produced positive results on the Cera test of the third generation version of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample was tested in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry, as has been done in recent weeks.
If the control tests confirm the positive Cera result, the Austrian will lose its third place and will be banned from racing for two years according to the regulations.
The report on the positive results of Kohl's third generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and reported to the Associated Press news agency that he had reported positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian managed to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans on the podium, as well as to win the top of the top mountain t-shirt.
NEW YORK TIMES ASK THE QUESTION, ITALY RASSIST?
Italy has only recently changed from a country of emigrants to one of the preferred destinations of reluctantly accepted immigrants.
This is why the "Belpaese" is transformed into a racist nation? The New York Times is asking this question, which, based on the case of young Burkina Faso Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan last month because he stole a box of biscuits, devotes a long article to the debate on racism in Italy.
The case characterizes what the New York Times calls "the paradox of the north": in the northern regions, "the strongest integration and the highest employment" is also the strongest in the country "the antiimmigrant and the support of the Northern League. "
In support of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, NYT also quotes cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would tighten the reins on immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants, were set up as an example of a change of mood in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano met Benedict XVI at Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church cooperate to combat racism."
Students suffer from expensive rents, it can cost up to 900 euros a room
The housing market for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by the Sunia, Homeowners' Union, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached such amazing proportions that, due to the enormous total costs for families, closes a wide range of students from the possibility of learning," explains Laura Mariani, Head of Sunia's Study Office. "In these cities, high demand from students has distorted the market to such an extent that a general increase process has also been launched against local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts with no rent restrictions, with associated rentals.
According to Sunia, exceptional measures would be needed to allow price capping through a review of the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, in the area of Brianza, 450 euros are charged for a bed; the price of a single room ranges from 650 euros (near Bande Nere) to 800 euros (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can reach 900 euros (near Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room costs about 700.
In Bologna, where most of the students live in a neighborhood close to the university, one bed costs EUR 250/280 if it is double and EUR 370-500 if it is a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are charged for a single and 450 beds in a double room.
Prices are somewhat cheaper (€550 in a single room) in the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburbs you can save some money: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are charged for one bed, from 400 to 600 euros for one room. The price range is highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, you have to pay 250/350 for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent a greater weight within the city budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where non-EU students often seek accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the time of the old movie halls in the cities is over.
Traditional movies close in favor of the Multiplexes.
"A city where there are no movies, a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by director Giuseppe Tornatore are an effective demonstration of what is happening in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the appearance of large, multi-room cinemas in the suburbs, and as a result the demise of single-room cinemas in city centres - seems inevitable and irreversible, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
When historical and memory-filled places disappear, "it's like a friend leaving, a friend with whom we shared our journey and many experiences," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which, twenty years ago, represented an Oscar Award and the Grand Prix of the Cannes Festival to Tornatore, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema, the yearning, after a movie experience that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, Anec's data, is clear: 316 traditional cinemas have closed in the last five years. The biggest losses were recorded by cinemas in large cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Among the most affected regions, Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-room cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that the rise in the number of multiplexes is the only proof of their disappearance, since Italy has the highest number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms has increased by 195 in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says the president of Anec Paolo Protti. "It is okay to build new facilities, but it should also ensure the survival of existing ones, because when a city cinema closes, not all visitors are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention uncharged financial funds intended to support operators: the state's overdue debt is estimated at about EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
To maintain the market, 16-18 million euros a year would be needed."
This is the first Italian city that has decided, in its concern over the closures, to remedy the problem in order to protect and boost single-room cinemas in the suburbs and downtown, through an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include tax incentives to operators and benefits to the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive into restricted zones and park in certain parking lots with reduced rates.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna's example, even by introducing other measures.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to combat multiplex control, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is more demanding.
Protecting traditional cinema has always been an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria, where I spent my childhood and youth, gave me the spark that ultimately made me do Cinema Paradiso, although I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the via Nazionale in front of the closed Rialto or Quirinale in order not to see the black posters of dust, I turn my head. I've had so many experiences here."
Between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious accusations were made against the judges of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria, mayor and deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning on charges of external involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
Handcuffs were placed in the hands of Gioacchino Piromalli, a senior mediator between the clan and the administration, as well as a nephew of a lawyer of the same name as the boss, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mob-like criminal organization and was compensated for EUR 10 million.
"The disregard of all legal and moral rules, what's more, good taste," states the state's attorneys. The two local authorities have declared their intention to pay a consultant's fee to lawyer Piromalli.
"So the clan would have had official access to the city hall, which would have given us an additional opportunity to control and manage the administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the General Assembly of the Calabria Region, does not hide that there are "many collusions between local institutions and organised underworlds" in the region: There are areas where the spread of the Mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean'.
The arrests this morning are a continuation of the events of July, when the police announced that they had succeeded in decapitating the Piromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to manage the local government. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was dissolved once in 1991, still due to the alleged mergers between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, the Christian Democratic mayor, who was reborn at the time of the dissolution, took the lead in the second round of the centre-right coalition in 2006.
He cried a scandal when the County Hall ordered the municipal committee to be dissolved.
He brought the former Deputy Minister of the Interior to justice, Marco Minnini, and accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but the court, in the order of arrest signed this morning, explained that the Piromalli clan had ventured to demand a change in the A3 project.
The wiretap against Dal Torrione shows, says the state's attorneys, that "it was inclined to meet the demands of an extensive entrepreneur known to be close to the Piromalli family, subjecting the decisions of the municipality to the clan interests."
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come.
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70 percent of the planet's surface and which is just being discovered by large international energy companies
Waves, ocean currents, tides, all renewable energy sources that have been eyeballed by giants like Chevron who are now trying to get their hands on it.
They've been searching for a hundred years for the possibility of getting energy from the sea's movements, and in the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
Around 1980, when the price of oil fell, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but today the demand for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices give the sector a new impetus.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimates in 2007 that 15 percent of the world's electricity needs could be covered by offshore wave facilities.
This is twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be currents and tides.
The giants are on the move.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and in 2005 signed an agreement on a power plant to be established in northern Portugal.
It seemed like a revolutionary step when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed, and more and more companies are voting for marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to supporting traditional energy.
"Chevron studies technologies that harness the energy of the oceans and considers the possibility of cooperation with us," said a spokesperson for an associated US oil giant, the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of a permit from the US Energy Commission to launch a offshore energy project in Alaska.
The issue is not small, especially considering that the US is currently in Alaska, and President Bush has also recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, New York Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey Ocean Power are also on their way out of the sea.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, we are still talking about primitive technology, even because energy from the sea does not dissipate doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, similar to those of Portugal or Scotland, are all small and therefore do not cause too much problems with the ecosystem.
However, in order to generate energy on a larger scale, it is necessary to have installations with a higher environmental impact.
There are several options: Ocean Power, for example, uses a interconnected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving up and down the buoys are converted into hydraulic pressure by the pistons and cylinders placed in them.
The pressure is turning a turbine that feeds a generator.
The electricity goes to the mainland on cables under the sea.
For now, there are four similar facilities in the planning phase that are just waiting for the federal permit, and some of the energy generated would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started power generation for a shopping mall and a parking lot with the help of six submarine turbines in the East River Strait of New York.
At tides, the movement of water turns the blades of the turbines, and this rotation feeds the generator.
Verdant stated that it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for permission to use energy.
The tides after the waves.
At present, the opportunities that can be exploited through tides deserve special attention.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, and therefore can be considered as a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy provided by the tide, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
