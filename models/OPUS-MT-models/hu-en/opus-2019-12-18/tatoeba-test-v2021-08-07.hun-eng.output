I should have stayed out of it.
I should have tried something else.
I shouldn't have left you alone.
I should have expected this.
I should have followed your advice.

I just want to know what's going on.

How about Monday?
Do you understand me?
I clicked on a picture.
I snuck into the house.
I snuck into the house.
I sneezed.
Is that okay with you?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't that stomach-stricken?
I sold it this afternoon.
Sometimes I'm sad.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.
Is it far to Paris?

A secret?
Is that right?
Is that intentional?
Is that fly in the picture or is it photographed?

I still can't tell you why.
That was seven or eight years ago, where exactly were you?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have plenty of time for fun.
There's still one or two things left to put in the suitcase.
I have to get some breakfast.
I still think it's the best choice.

I took his side.
I stopped by your place today, but you weren't home.
I stopped to talk.
I study about two hours a day.
I'm a hard learner at school.
I suggest you talk to Mary.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're already packed and ready to go.
I must have heard that voice somewhere.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until it's over.
I'll take your place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
He came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It comes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The price is two euros.
Could be a problem.
Must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work wasted.
He obviously freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
It didn't stop snowing.
It didn't stop snowing.
I don't care if you come.
Don't mention it.
It doesn't matter who started it and why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
I soon realized that I misunderstood him.
It snowed the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
This happened at the beginning of the previous week.
This happened on the day we were married, honey.
There must have been a reason.
It happened all of a sudden.
This happened when he was outside.
It happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
He's got his own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should diet.
I think everybody's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think he'll be fine with his neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think I've lost some film cubes.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I'd be able to kill.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I've got the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better this way.
I think it's fair.
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do that on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think that's true.
I think it was Tom who helped Mary.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think he'll be fine with his neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about this.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there.
I think Tom is a turn-on.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tom wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tom wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we're in the wrong direction.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all stingy now.
I think you have the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I guess you'd like it.
I think you misunderstood.
I think you should go in there in person.
I think you're the prettiest girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you have a very good job.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was obvious what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat, but it wasn't.
I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still at home.
I thought it was you or him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
You're hurting me!
You're hurting me.
I'm under the influence.
I was very impressed.
It's dangerous!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts that it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We need to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm can't be turned off.
That's not the best way.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, the weather's really bad today.
It's so expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
Time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
It's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important to wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be ready by the time you need it.
It'll be ready when it's necessary.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work if I replace the polarities.
Consequently, it appears to be larger.
Looks good.
Looks like you don't need me here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
Looks like you've thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
That could be a long time.
It could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it.
I might be late.
It's gotta be washed.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It's gotta be fixed.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to him even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tom.
I have a question for you, too.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I took care of it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took my shoes off.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
It rained yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I work out two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've traveled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything I could to keep him alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to keep my head down.
I'm trying to get my thoughts together.
That's a nice flag.
Big fur cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
It's a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
It's a good plan, on paper, anyway.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a watchdog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's totally dark outside.
It's all mine.
It's all right now, it's over.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
It's already in progress.
It's 10:00 in the evening.
One of my dreams has always been that I live by a creek.
It's always the same thing.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
That's too bad.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tom is leaving.
That's a pretty big club.
It's a rumor.
It's freezing.
It's as much art as it is science.
It's all in the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It's been an amazing journey.
It's a tiring day.
It's a tough day.
It's happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since she left me.
That's better.
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's burning.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
It's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I have goose bumps.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you put on a sweater?
It's common knowledge that a bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
It's okay now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
This is delicious!
It's done!
It's easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from afar.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't love Mary.
It seemed like forever to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Looks like nothing's changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
He seems to be lying.
Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to work out for me.
You seem honest to me.
Looks to me like you're wrong.
Looks like we're gonna have a special guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It's only fair that they get the same salary for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's a long way from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
He's starting to fall over.
It's getting serious.
It's gonna be a rough winter.
It won't be easy.
It's good luck seeing a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for learning.
It's great you could make it.
That's great, you're gonna laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to fall asleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to express in words.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
It's spooky.
He's got an unremarkably large head.
Tall.
Kids should be in bed.
Stop throwing money around.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
It's important.
It is important for parents to be on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important that we help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to comply with your terms.
We don't know what tomorrow will bring.
It's unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just a little further away.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's pretty heavy.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
It's laundry day.
It's like an underwater field, and turtles, rays and sharks above it, like flying creatures.
It's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
Not a bad idea.
It's not a bank.
It's not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not Gonna be his job to change Egypt.
It's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It can't be negated.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not about what you do, it's about how you do it.
It's not worth moaning about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't repent.
There's no point in moaning about the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
Definitely impossible.
It's obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
It's been three months, and Tom already says he's fluent in French.
It's only three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
It's bulging like I'm pouring out of a tub.
He's spread his wings.
It's pretty amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is reflected in the disparaging of the working class, absolving imperialism of the responsibility of the bloody wars that it arouses, and the idea that infinite wars are the cause of man's congenital aggressive tendencies.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
Few large gardens are found in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say the Czech girls are pretty.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston now.
It's so good to be home.
He's still moving.
It's suicide.
That's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
We still have to answer that.
It's time to pick up our tent.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to fix the problem.
I should get my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about this.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mary's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's expensive for me.
It's too hot for that now.
It's too late.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn weather.
Colds suck.
It's ugly, shrill yellow, and it's not harmonised with anything, but at least they don't run me over in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
It's unlikely anything serious will happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very confusing.
It's very entertaining.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
That's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed on.
It's your only option.
A thorough learning of a language takes about 10,000 hours of learning.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
Everyone was caught off guard.
It took just an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but we finally managed to find him.
I turned into a small alley.
I turned the page.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It's been a tough time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a pitch black night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
This was a tragic accident.
It was a really great meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully weird.
It's been a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost pitch black.
This was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy keeping my promise.
That was a low blow.
It didn't matter.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
I didn't mean to.
It wasn't our fault.
That wasn't so bad.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only learned his true purpose when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
He was really sad.
It was a success.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
It was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
It was Tom's turn.
They kept it completely secret.
She was uncertain if she was going to marry him.
That was urgent.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
It'll all be over in a few days.
It'll all be over in a few days.
It takes five or ten years to complete the technology.
This is gonna grow back.
That's what's gonna happen.
It's gonna rain for a week if it doesn't stop tomorrow.
This will threaten the well-being of the city.
We don't have to come back tomorrow.
There's no need to do that anymore.
It doesn't take much time.
It worked beautifully.
It works perfectly with your iPhone.
That would be dangerous.
That would be different.
It would be hard for me to get out of here.
It would be pointless.
This would have been better if it had been done already.
That wouldn't be bravery. That would be stupid.
It would have been better if we hadn't done that.
I underestimated Tom.
