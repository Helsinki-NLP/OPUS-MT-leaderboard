The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The initial preliminary results show that the early elections in Austria brought about a marked weakening of the two parties of the Great Coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the current President Wilhelm Molterer's position has seriously weakened, has suffered particularly heavy losses.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the provincial magistrate of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing to return to national politics.
Based on preliminary results, the country's strongest party remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it lost 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was the ÖVP, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25,6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in Austria's post-war history, and especially in the People's Party that has led to the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when leaving the ÖVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage in front of SPÖ, according to polls.
However, the voters apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
Even in the first reactions to the results, speculations were expressed about the possible resignation of Party President Wilhelm Molterer and the current Vice Chancellor.
The observers believe that this could take place at the extraordinary meeting of the party presidency on Monday.
This development is likely to facilitate the ever more likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP Grand Coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) gained 18 percent of the votes in advance and the BZÖ gained 11 percent of the votes - however, the Social Democrats expressed their fear of the repeat of 1999 when the People's Party agreed on common governance with the populists (the FPÖ was still united in the past, was removed from BZÖ in 2005), which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and I assume that he can return to Vienna for national policy, is obviously expecting this solution.
The Green Party has reached Parliament, but it has lost some of its popularity and has fallen from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the limit of four percent and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indian relations can get cold
If the problem of Czech scientists for the illegal collection of bugs could not be solved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that relations between the Czech Republic and India could result in a certain estrangement.
The Minister published this in New York after his meeting with Pranáb Mukherji, his Indian partner, today.
"If this were not resolved, yes, a certain estrangement would occur," he stated after the meeting, which took place as a Czech incentive.
After the trial, Mukherji said that it was difficult for the executive authority to intervene in court cases.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, acquitted and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local administration of Darjeeling, which is governed by the law.
"His problem could be solved," the Minister said.
However, according to Mukherji, Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison would prefer to appeal to a higher court.
Then you could apply for bail and wait for the verdict freely, explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, it would be possible to acquit him," said the chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech party can intervene in the whole case is to provide "competent legal support" to the sentenced party, the Indian Minister mentioned.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party had already provided them with such assistance.
"Our main interest with India is to maintain the best relations with many years of tradition.
This is acknowledged by the Indians," said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as you told ČTK, you stressed to your partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really find it a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The question of whether the Indian party had promised to deal with the matter was eluded by the minister.
"I've already received relatively many promises," he noted.
Czech judges in the battle for the seabed
It goes to the wall electronic map showing Australia and adjacent marine areas.
But he doesn't care about the continent, he does care about a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is the size of the continent itself," says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30-member working group in the United Nations Ocean and Marine Law.
His boss, Czech lawyer Mikulka Václav, director of the division, follows the explanation, which is sometimes supplemented.
Work swings and enthusiasm prevail here.
The seabed is a world rich in natural resources, and so far hardly known.
Oil, ore and other minerals can be found here, but so far they are also unknown living organisms, which can be the key to the development of anticancer medicines for example.
Seafloor larger than land
The coastal states are now intensely applying for new subsea areas.
Under the UN Convention, their rights were enforced, agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often stretches up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of the country.
Such a country has the exclusive right under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply simplified, we hold that part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental shelf, which is the natural continuation of the subsea continent.
At the borders of the coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles extend beyond the border of the so-called economic zone alone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the country to the Committee on the External Borders of the Continental Pedestrian Fund should be complemented by a number of extensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the committee.
So far, the Committee has discussed five applications: Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success recently echoed in the world, which was the first to significantly expand its underwater country.
But New Zealand has also won - the area of the sea bed awarded to it by the committee is about 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e. six times greater than the territory of the country.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits from future use of the seabed are expected to be invaluable.
Other countries are also continuing to submit their applications.
They can do so within 10 years of the moment of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean bottom declared by the Convention as the common heritage of humanity begins.
No country has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"However, the seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "some areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contracted. "
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares this with other countries of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint "Interoceanmetal" organisation.
Under the Convention, this organisation was granted the status of a pioneer investor in 1991, like investors in some other countries.
It is entitled to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area examined by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
It's a kind of underwater copy of the Tatras.
"A total of 75,000 square kilometres can be produced.
The area is a rich site of polymetal ores containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," mentions another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, of the Macedonian division, sets the example of another concretion.
It reminds me of the parchment with a potato or a little fantasy, the magic words that bring the Golem to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to solve the hostage crisis - and professionals came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
The release of the eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt will reveal more and more details.
According to data from the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior, German special forces participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
In addition to experts from the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Bureau of Criminal Affairs, as well as the German Technical Service's logistics experts, were also at the scene of the rescue.
According to the ministry spokespersons' Monday evening information, German forces were not needed, however, as the hostage takers allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized signs of violent hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as an on-site support force.
"Luckily it didn't happen," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers abducted the group of tourists of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on 19 September.
Following the kidnapping in the South Egypt desert area, the hostages were carried back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained unclear, as have the details of the rescue of the hostages or any ransom payments.
In the meantime, the escaped arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the hostages that were released were protected by the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, they have not yet provided any information as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five tourists and the special forces arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Force Aerobus.
The U.S. Assembly rejects the rescue package.
The lower house of the U.S. Congress, with a small majority, failed the proposed $700 billion rescue package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
The U.S. Assembly rejected the government's rescue package for financial markets by 227 votes to 206.
Despite calls from US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the programme did not receive a majority, which sought to curb the chaos prevailing in the financial markets.
The supporters desperately tried to convince the critics, in a dramatic action, of the need for a $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called on Members to support him, even if the plan is unpopular.
"It is difficult to obtain political support to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
Even during the vote, Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent and 600 points.
The investors were concerned that the public rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote so that it would fall again after failure was made public.
Experts are expecting further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the Assembly and the Senate.
The directors register more and more bookings.
It's a good winter for the German tour operators.
According to one study, the turnover of the road bookings for the coming months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans' travel mood has not diminished according to the study.
In winter season bookings, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the previous year, the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of bookings for autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was around 11 percent higher than in October 2007, DRV announced.
These results are based on GfK data, which evaluates the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and then extrapolates it to the entire market.
The Institute took account of the journeys booked by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar exchange rate, travels to the US are particularly sought, DRV said.
Here the rate of bookings increased by around one third.
The Germans are also particularly popular destinations in Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as in domestic landscapes.
The most sought-after roads were organized, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
Due to rising energy and food costs, the costs for organised roads are "better calculated for passengers than for individually organised journeys."
Passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, Laepple added.
The booking rate of summer months was also very good, so it will be possible to book a new increase in traffic compared to the previous year - although according to another study, fewer German tourists have undertaken trips compared to the previous year.
My first Oktober Painting
Without breaks repeated ballerman hits, liters of beers and designer dirndit celebrities.
Debut on Wiesn.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really look much alike.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she wears a custom-made dirndi.
My hair's dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress at the tavern.
But one thing connects us: We've only been on Wiesn for three minutes, photographers are rushing us and filling their memory cards - it's very flattering, and it's all on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how we make friends.
Looks like the cheap dirndli's doing its job.
As a Wiesn tourist north of the white sausage equator, my comfort is still limited by costumes.
But when you arrive at Theresienwies, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndli or leather pants; no one looks at me in a grudge or awkward way - everything is absolutely fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand are only reaped by my Dirndli apron.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I made the apron wrong: "You're free on the left, you're a virgin in the middle, you're sold to the right, widow in the back."
I secretly switched the bow from behind to left.
"That's good," he says and laughs.
Others make less fuss about fine flirting techniques, and wear simple Filck hats with "I'm too drunk to get dressed" and unsolicitedly show off their naked butts.
The young man with exhibitionistic features is called Bob, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic, stretching the "aaaaa" for a long time.
He tells me all this after getting rid of the contents of his earlier drink.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants everyone sees as a trash can.
So Bob is one of the infamous "no pissing people."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, the paramedics will patrol the scene and take care of the poor creatures.
Nurses always appear in teams - four at once carrying a covered gurney from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure full of stuff.
Who's lying in the alcohol coffin under the tarp doesn't show.
"These are the ones who are completely ready," one of the medics yells out to me at my question and then at the turn.
Police have named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
With the resident of Brentwood, Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, there was an accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
He was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 51 - year - old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released on bail ever since.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish hinterland.
On the eastern side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, there is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-renaissance style.
At least that's what the guidebooks say.
The building embraces the end of the platforms, each with a tower on each front corner, and looks like a German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's going a little crazy.
However, looking at the interior of the vaulted ticket office, it is evident that this was the most western doorway of a large enterprise.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future" of conquests, sought to achieve its ambitions to occupy the Middle East by means of this railway from Damascus to Baghdad to today's Saudi Arabia.
German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railroads were attacked by Lawrence and his Arab partisans in Arabia.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army left Egypt and forced the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station didn't do any better.
In 1917 an ammo train exploded and destroyed the building's beautifully designed roof.
According to Turkish sources, there's been a sabotage operation.
Since then, it has slowly fallen apart, and history has gone far beyond it.
At the same time, today, as the gateway to the railway to Anatolia and the entire eastern region, it serves as, at least symbolically, an expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Justice and Development Party on the Government - the AKP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is noteworthy that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq, Iran and, of course, the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I took the night train to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of tumbling, which gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary "The Night Mail" about the old world, I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is intended to symbolize the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP with known Islamic roots represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
This caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the headquarters of the AKP, an ultra-modern, stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose, which is located in a developing suburban district between half-finished shopping centers and cafés. In the latter, the mid-leaders in suits - both men and women - meet to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have fit in with a right-to-middle politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, a tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy goal is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
"The Cold War has upset order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its hinterland.
He had to head east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open both ways.
"But is it possible that sooner or later you will be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to go to a crossroads."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here was saying almost mechanically: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea are of the same benefit to Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
It is as if they are trying to convey the message that, metaphorically speaking, with Turkey, all of Europe can reach Asia and the Middle East on those east-bound railway lines.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, after another night spent most of the night awake, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched this fancy structure recover 100 years ago.
How they would have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I waited for the ferry at the port to take me back through Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was then called "the sick man of Europe."
At least at that time, there was no question which continent would claim this exciting country.
Memorable Ways of Life: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as the musical director of Guildford, Vernon "Tod" Handley (ecrologic, 11 Sep) led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the part of the city, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
In principle, only under 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang his finale in 1979 - many of us were in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological shape-shifter) was in line with the choir's determination and ability to cope with any music they put before it - be it the madrigal or a messiaen piece; without escort or a large orchestral entourage.
The musical versatility of such a young choir has often been astonishing and always exciting, and it is thanks to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod told us to "let the music speak on its own."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it."
His conductor technique was always completely understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerating.
Whatever the level of music was, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If ever there was a conductor who should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well during the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 or so years, I have written criticisms of over 100 concerts, but it has never disappointed me with one, and it has often inspired me.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply "blown through the world with one or two well-known battlehorses."
A lot of us are gonna miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your obituary William Woodruff (25 September), "In 1946 he continued his studies in economic history in Oxford, and in 1950 he became a scholar at the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while continuously preparing for his basic degree, master's degree and PhD title."
It's from Woodruff's "Beyond Nab End," but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953 he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and while under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers he finished his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which he then published in 1958 under the title "The British Rubber Industry."
In 1950-51 he was in the USA with a Houblen-Norman scholarship and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
You don't know why Woodruff was doing this time of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"J. Vicente Resino's "Flamenco és élet" exhibition is recommended because its black-and-white, documentary-style photos are impressive.
The simplicity and strength that came from them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, attracted my attention.
This exhibition is emotional.
Resino knows how to capture magic moments."
Second selling record at Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing second generation Jazz.
True, his predecessor had a large passenger space, but the design of the interior of the new model was even more spacious.
This is coupled with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus evolution.
This is what the second generation Honda Jazz looks like.
Although it is very similar to its predecessor in the sight of the new Jazz, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include innovative design, new body, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we move on to a detailed presentation of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was launched.
So, first of all, it can be said that Honda managed to renew this model in less time than other producers.
Although Jazz is less known in Europe, it breaks sales records in other markets.
For example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought after car brand in 2002 and then in 2008 this year.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since its entry into the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million sales in six years.
However, Honda wants to increase traffic in the area with the new Jazz.
In other words, while in 2007, the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 Jazz, by 2009 estimates target the sale of 100,000 cars, which would lead to an increase of 17% on the European market.
Since 2002, Honda has sold 8000 Jazz on the Spanish market, representing 6,7% of Honda's total turnover in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the Spanish subsidiary's managers calculate 2000 sales in one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda's traffic in Spain.
The representatives of the company predict 22,000 sold copies by the end of this year, which is 4000 less than in 2007, i.e. a decrease of 16%.
Despite the terms of the sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which rose to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate to 2% by 2010.
Honda hopes to achieve this by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a hybrid with five doors and a compact size - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would market 200,000 pieces a year worldwide.
According to the Japanese producer, Insight would account for 50% of its market share, while the remainder would be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial introduction of Insight is due in the first months of the year after the official Valencian presentation scheduled for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more spacious in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width is 1690 mm (two centimeters wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
However, its height remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment became more spacious.
The larger interior is guaranteed by the new body on the one hand, and the fuel tank in the middle on the other - this solution is known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo space of the so-called double-floor trunk has increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres above the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes the fact that these dimensions apply to the type with the 1.4 engine, since the trunk of the 1,2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external changes can also be discovered, such as rear-end lamps or optional panorama glass roofs and easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors for the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the angle of the first Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the start of its traffic, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model and is characterised by lower CO2 emissions and excellent mechanical co-ordination, while the engine delivers excellent performance in all respects.
The output of the 1.2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at 6000 speed and maximum torque at 114 Nm at 4900 revolution.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and has 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100 horsepower 1.4 Jazz consumes 5.4 liters on average and has 128 grams of CO2.
The collision avoidance "bee car"
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired this time by nature, precisely from the world of bees, for its new invention.
The Japanese company designed a robot that imitates the flight of bees to avoid accidents.
Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in the development of collision prevention technologies.
The engineers of Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Center built this little robot in Japan in cooperation with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the renowned Tokyo University.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Technological PR and Research Development Brand Director, defined BR23C as a further extension of the four-level safety shield of Nissan.
The robot enhances the impact avoidance capacity of the company's products.
During flight, each bee develops its oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the role of the complex eye of the uterus is far more important than that, with which it can see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser telemeter (Laser Range Finder).
The apparatus identifies obstacles within a 180 degree field of vision before BR23C within a distance of up to 2 metres, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an action to avoid collision.
"When an obstacle is detected, the small robot immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle in order to avoid collision.
The main difference between the system and the instruments currently available is that in this case the bypass manoeuvre takes place entirely automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Andoh Toshiyuki, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
By way of derogation from bees, by-pass manoeuvres shall not be directed upward or downward, nor diagonally, shall they move only in two dimensions and only in the direction of wheel rotation, i.e. not in an infinite direction and way, as is the case with bees.
Therefore, Nissan used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions in addition to acceleration and slowing.
"This device must process and react to the data every few seconds.
There is no need to store data, nor to use intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can operate without interruption with only a few dozen KB memories.
This may sound surprising, but it's not a gigabyte, but we don't even talk about memories the size of megabyte.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology, which, according to Nissan's estimates, could enter mass-produced cars within ten years.
The robot is powered by lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more durable than the lithium ion version.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system could be an additional application opportunity to get the driver to the final destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of investment cash, has no lack of common sense.
Because of the crisis on their necks and the fact that Americans wouldn't be entangled in the mazes of questionable solvency mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel."
This is the "Hotel of Bad Credits" -- that is, the troubles.
Accommodation, and especially receptionist's gloomy face, suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether the time for borrowing has actually just come.
And especially where to apply for credit, because that's probably the purpose of the thing.
The information on the website is really useful, but it is not detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the general public.
But what would happen if we completed the game?
For example, a room for our dreams would appear in the hotel.
Actually, it's something, because we can't even dream of buying a place.
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would give a share in its capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest bank in Japan will pay USD 9 billion for 21% of the company's capital, after Morgan Stanley's stock price has fallen heavily on the stock exchange.
One week after disclosure of the preliminary agreement, the two banks said that MUFG would purchase 9,9% of Morgan Stanley's ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price is more than 19% lower than the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will give it a 10% return and a conversion rate of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley reports that the global transaction is based on an average price of $29, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price dropped by 6,79% in Greenwich mid-time around 17:00, closing at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up its transformation into a banking company," explains John Mack, CEO of the US company group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week to diversify its activities, while at the same time being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
Once again, the agreement with MUFG confirms that the current financial crisis calls for even greater caution from the giants listed on Wall Street.
From the conditions announced on Monday, it can be seen that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan only announced that it will sell 20% of its shares to the Japanese company for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would consist entirely of ordinary shares," explained Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and prevent potential risks."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share is reduced by approximately 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG can convert half of its preferential shares into ordinary shares after one year if the latter's trading rate exceeds the exchange rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it rises to approximately USD 47.
Morgan Stanley will thus ensure that funds from MUFG can help you exploit your investment opportunities, improve your balance sheet and increase your liquid resources.
However, the spokesperson of the group did not wish to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following the addition of MUFG, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase Tier I's solvency rate by around 15%, making it one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that its balance has improved "definitely" since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as the price of its shares has fallen by half, while the cost of securing against the risk of non-payment has skyrocketed.
This cost decreased on Monday, but remained at a high level of around 12%.
After the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, this is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that he had reached $15 billion, some of which came from the Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett Group.
Rafael Correa's statement on Monday, Quito
Rebuilding the republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan of the Venezuelan Hugo Chavez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadoran Rafael Correa.
Following the pattern of his fellow presidents and friends on Sunday, Correa explained her ideas about the new constitution.
He succeeded in his mission, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum according to official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted against, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0,7% of the votes were unfilled.
The adoption of the draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, both the two surveys carried out at the polling offices' exits and the counting carried out by a civil society organisation proved the huge superiority of the 'yes' votes with a ratio of 63% and 70% respectively.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke of the victory of his draft constitution from Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution has won a sweeping victory," he said, thanking the Ecuadorans at its governing seat in Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez, Morales, and Chilean president Michelle Bachelet.
The U.S. Organization (OAS) observation mission reported that the vote was conducted in a calm atmosphere, with its main theme being a 444-point text that summarized the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed constitution puts state power at the service of the economy, maintaining the right of the State to "design development" for a country which is basically based on oil extraction by foreign companies and the foreign currency sent by emigrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Head of State, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to the dissolution of the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she wants to take advantage of this opportunity and will compete again in February 2009 for the head of state mandate.
The Constitution also included free health services and education. The President has already started to introduce this in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants, and half of the population lives below the minimum living age.
Finally, the Constitution forbids the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could bring an end to Quito and Washington's agreement on the use of the Ecuadorian facility as the basis for U.S. anti-drug measures.
They freed the 19 hostages in Chad
Egyptian commando raided the kidnappers, who took 11 tourists and their eight escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently, in good condition, they arrived at the Al-Maza military base by plane around 3:30 p.m., which is directly connected to the Cairo International Airport.
The hostages were banned from reporting to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in Maadi, Cairo's suburban residential area, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and the kidnappers are "not paid ransom," said the Egyptian Minister for Tourism Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
The hostages were captured on 19 September at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border areas of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where SUV safari took place, and the group was then taken from one hiding place to another by the 35 unknown hostage-takers.
The group included 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman) and eight Egyptian tourists: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Aegyptous travel agency.
According to an Egyptian security officer, a 30-man special commando arrived at the scene on two helicopters, where they raided the hostage takers just before dawn.
"There was a firefight between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed, and the others fled," said the leader asking for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Squad to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader, Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We must recognise that we could not have achieved this result without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and action groups," he said, without further details.
He also denied that the hostages were being paid ransom.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that a SUV had been intercepted while patrolling, and six of them (including the leader of Chad) were killed and two were arrested.
According to the military, the hostage takers were linked to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Liberation Movement in Sudan (SLA-U), which was immediately refuted by the organisation concerned.
Lettres - The "silent majority of culture"
Newspaper news and the ongoing election campaign are currently at the heart of the debate on culture funding.
We should be happy about that.
But a piece of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will raise his word to show what ridiculous amounts of money are managed by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical monuments on the brink of hunger?
Which politician dares remind the federal government that he does not care about his monuments and buildings that are part of his cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that truly ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only spent three and a half million euros to restore the Chinon Castle in the Valley of Loire?
The constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and that heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, all elected representatives and all governmental bodies.
Within the framework of the Association of Historical Societys of Quebec (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Quebec), over 40,000 volunteers of 211 companies with history, cultural heritage, archival and genealogy are working on the research of history, as well as the preservation of a large number of private archives and archaeological finds, with a minimum budget.
Often these organizations protect our heritage with tooth and nail, and protest with the last force of the drowning, when property developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemeteries.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
The Benelux governments nationalise part of the Bank of Fortis
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux States help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortison, the first European, due to the spill-over effects of the US credit crisis: the three countries support the financial and insurance institution with interests in Hungary with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Governments agreed at the highest level at the end of the week, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's Competition Officer.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first major crisis in the context of an international money market crisis that has been ringing in waves for more than a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore be considered as precedents in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states purchase almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, the activities purchased from ABN Amró in the Netherlands last year, mainly its insurers.
Fortis' shares started a steep fall last week, and in the second half of the week, there were serious crises at the institute.
Analysts agree, however, that with 85 000 employees, the bank is too large to be allowed to go bankrupt.
The company's paperwork fell to about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In terms of current stock prices, the total market value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to corporate managers this is not realistic.
By the way, the management blamed the overseas market uncertainties associated with the adoption of the $700 billion US package plan for the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the paperwork has risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx appointed a new CEO to lead the bank.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one had come forward with a substantial offer.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry or lose money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients, the accounts have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has an independent account and has acquired leasing companies.
Fox in the Henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with the applicant on the basis of people's drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that always links the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned.
This should be in independent hands, otherwise the fox will be left to the henhouse," recalls Richard Dick, the developer of the drug prescription program, Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the insurance premium and the amount due in the event of damages dependent on the health of the applicant client, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they do not take insurance with it.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick came up with a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: based on the customer's identification number, he easily obtains the medicines that he has purchased in the last year and a half, and this leads the program to conclude what kind of illness he suffers from and what his health status is.
For example, if you regularly take high doses of cholesterol, it suggests that you have virtually unmanageable high levels of fat in your blood, which immediately lists you as a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are on the market, some of them also set a risk factor, so the insurance company has little to do but not just paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The drawbacks include that some medicines can be used for several uses, for example some compounds can also be used against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
The latter constitutes a significant risk-enhancing factor for business insurers, but not for business insurers.
Separate companies were formed to request and process the data, and they asked the patient's consent before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies.
They are now bound by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure so far.
Some companies have been processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data so that they can provide a more accurate picture of the patient's health.
More and more companies have access to the data, and monitoring of the use will be increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate health data protection law, but its scope only covers healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before the convention, there is a bill that gives authorities control over businesses that specialize in reporting.
Dick Richard admits that this is not enough: he therefore improved his programme, which would link the transmission of data to the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another issue is that the data subject cannot deny the consent, otherwise the insurers do not enter into a contract with him.
So the chickens are somewhat dependent on the fox's kindness.
Global Marseille menu
Double trade between the European Union and India
Since the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this subject, along with the other, largely global, problems.
Today there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will be the main issue.
While the European Union acknowledges that India is an emerging democratic great power that should have a greater say in international affairs, but the Member States have not yet reached a common denominator, do they support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
Thus, this issue was not pushed to the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the Union, Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who agreed to double trade in five years, i.e. to increase trade turnover to a large amount of EUR 100 billion.
Given that trade between 2000 and 2007 has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious target.
In this context, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally consolidated, i.e. air traffic can fly in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance that while the EU is India's number one trading partner, New Delhi is only in the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, was condemned in all its forms on both sides and urged for a UN conference to be convened.
They also called for the conclusion of the Doha trade round, although both have a large share of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to its energy and climate agenda, i.e. to reduce emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India agreed with this, as well as with the need to make a global deal at the next climate conference and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent food prices from rising, and they supported the call for an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where at the bilateral meeting he is preparing to do business on the peaceful use of nuclear power.
In Paris, they hope that the construction of Indian nuclear reactors will be entrusted to French companies with a value of EUR 20 billion.
According to news agency reports, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Italian publishers are represented in a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting, the 60th Buchmesse fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is expected to have 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries, on a base area of 171,790 square meters, where more than 403.000 books will be presented.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy State Secretary of the Ministry of Culture and Activities: Italy will occupy 264 square meters of exhibition space by setting up a single Italian Pont.
The opening ceremony will be followed by a press conference at the "Room Struktur" room of the pavilion 5.0 of Buchmesse, where information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing will also be presented.
According to the data, the proportion of foreign authors on the Italian publishing market is constantly decreasing, especially in adult and youth publications.
They found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire who disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007.
The wrecks were found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada mountains on the California and Nevada border in Mammoth Lakes.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, eliminated all remaining doubts: "After determining the position of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's about the plane that Steve Fossett flew the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Road Safety Agency (NTSB) announced that a few hours after the wreckage was discovered, an investigation committee was asked to identify the plane and to determine that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on September 3, 2007, the day Fossett left Yerington Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, too, in California, near the Nevada border, a couple near his home in Mammoth Lakes found some of Fossett's personal belongings.
Two I.D.s registered to Fosset, issued by the Illinois Flying Commission, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was abandoned a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire has set a number of peaks that have enabled him to enter into history.
In 2002, at the sixth try, he was the first to fly around the world with a balloon: two weeks of lonely flying.
Three years later, he was flying around the ground without landing.
Several of his records include flying above the Andes, at a height of 15.445 meters, carried out by a copilot.
GLK, Shocking Advertising
It is an unusual, yet original and decisively shaped hobbies walker with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "compact SUV" of Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
This is precisely the reason why the introduction campaign of SUV GLK, available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms, will be surprising and unusual from 17 October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle is using an unknown media communication tool, including utopian 3D posters that have not yet been used in Italy by car brands.
The giant poster action, consisting of three stages, will rule the central shopping street of Milan, Corso Como by 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication begins with the spatial presentation of the car, in which the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, will be seen in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional form.
The viewer will feel as if the car has emerged from the poster.
Then, through the innovative Elumina8 technology, every detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one, so that it can then be integrated into a unified image.
Undoubtedly, with this promotion, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new into the stereotyping world of the automotive industry.
Are we going to be able to raise the interest of prospective buyers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're young people from Triveneto.
But who are these 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? Members of the group called Ultras Italia, which has been following the team for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble so far.
They've never fought against their opponent's fans.
The core of the group is on the right.
Main organizers are coming from Trivento.
And Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
They were joined by smaller sporadic groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact, only a few units).
They were waving Italian flags that marked the hometown of the fans: on Saturday they were taken off so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, you're facing a real Nazi cheerleader, the Levski fans.
The Italian soccer association provided 144 tickets to Italian fans, which were names, making it easier to control the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of Interior checked everyone: there was no one in Sofia who would be in the process, no one who would have been banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with football-related priors refused tickets and exits.
At present, the Ministry of Interior is awaiting reports from the Sofia Police Department, and then takes the necessary measures: fans who have been arrested or identified during the riots may be subject to a five-year ban.
This is an international ban, which applies not only to visits to all stadiums in Italy but also to all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't set foot on any football field.
Luckily.
However, we also have to fear that hooligans will find followers, that is to say, these few hundred and fifty people will be joined by others.
"You must immediately stop this fire, you must not excuse the person who behaves like this," the Ministry of Interior said.
So we'd better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's National Team game is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
The Watch Service will meet tomorrow, and the Sports Event Security Analysis Committee, which can count on a department of Homeland Security, will meet on Tuesday with the Cheerleading Service Secret Service.
"Duce-Duce chanting and swinging arm during the Italian anthem?
This thought was expressed, in a rather unfortunate way, by Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed a few weeks ago to head of the Ministry of Interior's observation service (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and before that by Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously Chief Constable of Trieste, the city where there has been a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group since 2002.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to feed the Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of those 150-200 fans was still shameful.
I'm not a sociologist. I'm the first man in the surveillance service, but crimes should be judged in the country of the crime scene.
Until now, this group has not been a problem, and we need to examine exactly what has happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's talk a little bit about the Italian anthem whistling: it's not a crime either, but, if I may say so, it can't be called education."
