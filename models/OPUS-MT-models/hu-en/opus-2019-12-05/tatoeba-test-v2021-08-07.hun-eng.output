Is that all right?
It wasn't enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't it intoxicating?

Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.

That was seven or eight years ago, where exactly were you there?
I still don't understand anything.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have a lot of time to have fun.
There's one or two things left to put in the suitcase.
I have breakfast to eat.
I still think it's the best choice.

I stopped by your place today, but you weren't home.
I stopped to talk.
I study about two hours a day.
I study diligently at school.
I suggest you talk to Mari.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I guess you're packed and ready to go.
I'm sure I've heard that sound before.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Does your daughter feel better?
Are you doing a dangerous job?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we get it over with.
I'll take your place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a few times.
It's up to you.
He came out of nowhere.
It could be better with your sister.
It goes with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
The cost of this is two euros.
Could be a problem.
Must be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all these jobs go to waste.
It definitely freaked me out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
The snow didn't stop.
The snow didn't stop.
I don't care if you come.
No problem.
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem that complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it's been spilled on me.
I was beginning to realize that I had misunderstood him.
It was snowing the day before.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your confidence in me.
It happened at the beginning of the week before.
This happened on the day of our marriage, darling.
There had to be a reason for that.
It was sudden.
This happened when he was out there.
It happened to me several times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everyone.
It doesn't taste good.
He has his own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think all fat people should be on a diet.
I think everyone's hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think he'll be fine with his neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think I lost some film cubes.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I understand.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm dying.
I think I'm losing my mind.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I thought I saw a rat.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better that way.
I think it's fair.
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that you can do that on your own.
I think he's leaving.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think it's unfair.
I think it's true.
I think it was Tom who helped Mari.
I think you should leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think he'll be fine with his neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I find spiders cute.
I think he's at home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about that.
I think that would explain everything.
I'm thinking, so I'm drinking.
I'm thinking, so I exist.
I don't think there's any point in trying to convince him.
I think they did a great job.
I suppose that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's gonna be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.
I think Tomi's a turn-on.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Thomas wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Thomas wins.
I think we can handle it.
I think we need to be patient.
I think we've gone the wrong way somewhere.
I think we need to be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all slutty now.
I think you got the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Thomas's girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I suppose you'd like it.
I think you got it wrong.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you have a very good job.
I think you smell nice.
I feel like you haven't been convincing enough.
I think you were right.
I meant Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it would cheer me up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I'd go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought it was clear what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the mat, but it wasn't.
I thought Tomi was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
It hurts!
You're hurting me.
I'm under the influence.
He was very impressed with me.
This is an accident!
It's a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we were talking about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everyone.
I have doubts about whether it will work.
It's getting really late.
He's gone.
We're half an hour after midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
He's in the kitchen.
Wonderful!
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We must prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to study.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke alarm cannot be turned off.
That's not the best way to do it.
It's not the right thing to do.
It's not too much to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying.
It's not polite to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
He's still moving.
Wow, the weather's really bad today.
It's so expensive.
Thirty meters long.
It's time for bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
It's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It's very important that you wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It'll be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be done by the time it's done.
He'll be ready when he has to.
It's gonna take you a while to get used to wearing those glasses.
He'll be gone soon.
It'll work if I change the polarities.
As a consequence, it looks bigger.
It looks good.
Looks like I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
That makes me sad.
That's what matters.
This could be a long time.
This could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy it if we tried.
I might be late.
You have to wash it.
It has to mean something.
It must have been love.
It must have been stolen.
It has to be fixed.
It never existed.
It should never have happened.
I lied to her even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do the best I could.
I told him to come.
I told Tomi not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you didn't listen to me.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tomi.
I have a question for you, too.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I was on Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the animal hospital yesterday.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It's probably cheaper somewhere else.
It rained last morning.
It rained yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I train for two hours a day.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I've traveled across the United States.
It actually works.
That's really sad.
I tried everything to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tomi.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'll try to keep you informed.
I'm trying to get my mind together.
That's a nice flag.
Big-coat cat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
It's a dictionary.
Good plan, on paper, anyway.
A gray stone building.
It's a guard dog.
It's half an hour till lunch.
It's a hot day.
It's a kitchen knife.
It's all dark out there.
It's all mine.
It's all right now, it's over.
That's a nice and good theory, but will this work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's 7: 00.
It's already happening.
It's already 10: 00 in the evening.
One of my dreams has always been to live next to a stream.
It's always the same thing.
Environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a pity.
Too bad I'm late.
Too bad Tomi's leaving.
It's a pretty big stick.
It's a horror story.
It's freezing.
It's as much art as it is science.
It's all in the past.
She's in school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
That's terrible.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It was an amazing trip.
It's a tiring day.
It's been a rough day.
This has happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since he left me.
That's better.
Better water the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's burning.
It's cheaper to get on a bus.
This is Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
Closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I have goose bumps.
It's cold outside.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's common knowledge that bears like honey.
It doesn't matter whether Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
All right now.
It's dangerous here.
It's deep here.
This is delicious.
It's done!
It's easier not to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from afar.
It's simple to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.
It seemed like forever to me.
The bus seemed to be late.
That sounds ridiculous.
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Nothing seems to have changed.
It looks really weird.
Looks like it.
Looks like he's lying.
Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
Like you don't want this to work out for me.
Looks to me like you're being honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're going to have an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
Expensive.
It's only fair they get the same salary for the same job.
It's not nearly perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is for you.
You know, it's funny.
It's starting to roll over.
It's getting serious.
We're gonna have a rough winter.
It won't be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for studying.
It's great you could make it.
I'm sure you'll laugh.
It's hard not to come to that conclusion.
It's hard to believe the weather has been clear and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to fall asleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to express in words.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
It's spooky.
He's got a very large head.
He's tall.
Kids should be in bed by now.
Stop wasting money!
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's illegal.
This is important.
It's important for parents to be on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important that we help those in trouble.
That's impossible for me.
You need to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to comply with your terms.
There's no telling what tomorrow will bring.
Unbelievable, you know?
It's inevitable.
It's inspiring.
It's just a hunch.
Just over there.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
It's just a phone.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
It's kind of hard.
That's pretty important.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's late.
It's laundry day.
It's like an underwater field, and over turtles and rayans and sharks, it's like flying creatures.
It's locked.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me.
It's pathetic how he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
This is my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
Now it's my turn.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
None of your business.
Not a bad idea.
This isn't a bank.
Not as crazy as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
This won't happen.
It's not Mennad's job to change Egypt.
This isn't mine.
It's not my fault.
Can't be negative.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth moaning about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
There's no point in confessing to the priest if you don't repent.
There's no point in bitching about the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's definitely impossible.
Obviously, it's weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
It's been three months, and Tomi says she speaks fluent French.
Just three days.
It's on the other side of the park.
Sounds good.
It's over, isn't it?
It's over.
It's personal.
They're pouring like they're pouring out of a tub.
He was pulling his wings out.
It's pretty amazing.
Pretty convincing.
It's quite simple.
It is quite clear that the purpose of these misanthropic theories manifests itself in the defamation of the working class, relieving imperialism from the responsibility of the bloody wars it incites, and to spread the core of the idea that endless wars are caused by the innate aggressive tendencies of man.
It's urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, isn't it?
It's really a big deal.
It's over there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit!
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing here.
It's snowing in Boston.
It's so good to stay home.
He's still moving.
This is suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
Theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
Same old problem.
You still have to answer that.
It's time to pack up our tent tree.
Time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
Time!
It's time to rectify the problem.
I need to get my hair cut.
Time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about it.
It's Tom's birthday.
It's Tom's decision.
Tomi's word against Mari's word.
It's too dark to play ball.
This is expensive for me.
It's too hot for that now.
Too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical fall time.
Cold sucks.
It's ugly, it's bright yellow, and it's not harmonious with anything, but at least they don't run over you in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think he is.
There's no way anything serious is going to happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
Very attractive.
It's very boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very confusing.
Very entertaining.
It costs a lot to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That's what we agreed.
This is your only chance.
To learn a language carefully, you need about 10,000 hours of learning.
You have to be bold to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
Everyone was caught off guard.
It took just an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to pick out a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but we managed to find it after all.
I turned to a small alley.
I turned the page.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was fun.
It was a dark night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
That was a tragic accident.
It was a really good meal.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was so weird.
It's been a wonderful day.
It was a wonderful night.
It was chaotic.
It was obviously very enjoyable.
We had fun last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot, and it was humid.
It was just a trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
That's what I wanted.
It was almost pitch black.
This was shortly before John had an idea. John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
That wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
It wasn't easy keeping my promise.
That was a low blow.
It wasn't interesting.
I wasn't the one who slammed the door.
It wasn't my fault.
It wasn't intentional.
It wasn't our fault.
It wasn't that bad.
It's not the first time they've done this.
It wasn't Tom.
It was a joke.
I only knew his true intention when I met him.
It didn't hurt.
It rained last night.
It was kind of weird.
That was really interesting.
It was really fast.
It was really sad.
It was a success.
That was great.
That's all I could think about.
It was the worst pain I've ever experienced.
Tom was next.
They kept it a secret.
He was unsure if he was going to marry her.
That was urgent.
In a few days, it'll all be over.
It'll all be over in a few days.
It'll all be over in a few days.
