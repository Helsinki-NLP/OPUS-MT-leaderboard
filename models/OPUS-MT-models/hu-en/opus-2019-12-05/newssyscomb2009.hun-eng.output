The victory of right-wing populists in Austria, with a total of 29 percent
The two parties of the great coalition so far have experienced a significant weakening and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties, according to the first preliminary results, the early elections in Austria took place on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP), where the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously swayed, suffered a particularly strong loss.
On the other hand, the President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖG), the provincial magistrate of Carinthia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a winning return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖG) with 29.8% of the votes, but it has lost 5.5% of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse was ÖVP, which loses almost nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent.
These are the worst achievements of both major parties in Austria's post-war history and, in particular, the result for the People's Party that created the early elections is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, on leaving the ÖVP coalition, the People's Party had a significant advantage before SPÖG according to public opinion polls.
The voters, however, apparently punished him for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, speculation has been made about the possible resignation of the Party President Wilhelm Molterer and the current Vice-Chancellor.
The observers believe that this may take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Party Administration.
This development would probably facilitate the more likely way out of the election result, i.e. the renewal of the SPÖG and ÖVP grand coalition.
In view of the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the Austrian Party for Freedom (FPO) had previously obtained 18% of the votes and 11% of the votes - however, social democrats expressed fear of the repetition of 1999, when the People's Party had agreed with the populists in common governance (the FPO was still united at the time, it had ceased from the BZU in 2005), which even caused sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna in national politics, is obviously expecting this solution.
The Group of Greens has also reached Parliament, which has lost some popularity, and has fallen from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
None of the other parties exceeded the four percent limit and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Indies can get cold
If it were not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists reported for illegal bug collection, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said that a certain degree of coldness could occur in relations between the Czech and Indian countries.
This was published by the Minister in New York after meeting Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner, today.
"If this would not be resolved, yes, there would be a certain dissolution," he stated after the meeting, which was made from the Czech incentive.
Mukherji, after the trial, told me that in court matters, the executive authority is having trouble interfering.
However, he mentioned that, in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government may negotiate with the local leadership of Darjeeling, the case being governed by law.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
However, Mukherji, sentenced to three years in prison to Emil Kučera, believes that it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
Then you could apply for bail and wait for the verdict, you explained it.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed himself in the same way during the trial.
"He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, it would be possible to relieve him," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way for the Czech party to intervene in the whole case is to provide the prisoner with "competent legal support ', mentioned by the Minister of India.
At the same time, he told me that the Indian party already provided them with such assistance.
"It is in our best interest to maintain the best relations with India with many years of tradition.
The Indians admit that, "said Schwarzenberg.
At the same time, as you said to ČTK, you pointed out to your partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We believe it is indeed a serious mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The question whether the Indian party had been promised to deal with the case, the minister avoided the answer.
"I have received a relatively large amount of promises," he observed.
Czech Judges in the fight for the seabed
It goes to the wall electronic map on which Australia and neighbouring maritime areas are visible.
But he doesn't care about the continent, but he does care about a point that disappears in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, along with the adjoining seabed.
In the area the size of the continent itself, "says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the 30 members of the United Nations Division Ocean and Maritime Law.
His boss, Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, director of Division, is monitoring the explanation he sometimes adds.
There's work and enthusiasm here.
The seabed is a world rich in natural resources, barely known so far.
There are also oil, ore and other minerals here, but so far also unknown living organisms that may be the key to developing anti-cancer medicine.
Seabed greater than dry land
Today, coastal states are intensively applying for new subsea areas.
According to the United Nations Convention, their rights are enforced, which was agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometres from the coast of that country.
Such a country has exclusive rights under the Convention to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simultaneously, we hold the part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continental shelf which is the natural continuation of the subsea.
The coastal sea, often 200 nautical miles, goes beyond only the border of an economic zone, "explains Mikulka.
The request, submitted by the country to the Commission which has designated the external borders of the Continental shelf, should be supplemented by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on a number of expensive research and measurement.
This is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is legal and technical assistance to the committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five requests, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three countries have succeeded so far, "added Mikulka.
In the world, Australia's success has recently echoed, which has first significantly expanded its underwater country.
But New Zealand also won - the area of the seabed awarded to it by the Commission is about 1.6 million square kilometres, six times larger than the country's territory.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the research.
The profits resulting from future use of the seabed will, according to their hopes, be invaluable.
Other countries also submit applications on a continuous basis.
They may do so within 10 years of the moment of ratification of the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor declared by the Convention as "the common heritage of humanity."
No country has an exclusive position here anymore.
The right to extraction in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
"However, the seabed is not Klondike," says Director Mikulka, exaggerating that "certain areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is contracted."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares with other countries in this former Eastern bloc within the framework of the common "Interoceanmetal" organisation.
Under the Convention, this organisation received the so-called "pioneer investor 'status in 1991, like investors in some other countries.
It is authorised to produce in the ClarionClipperton zone between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean.
The area reviewed by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is there, it's a kind of underwater copy of the Tatras.
"This can be extracted in a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich site of nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese polymetallic ore, "mentioned another lawyer, the Hindu Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, the Macedonian coworker of the division, presents another example of specificity.
It reminds me of a potato or, with a little imagination, a parchment with the magic words that bring Golem back to life.
German special forces were present at the hostage rescue.
The Egyptian Government asked Germany for help in solving the hostage crisis - and the professionals came.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not deployed.
11 European tourists abducted in Egypt are getting more and more details.
German special forces were involved indirectly in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior.
In addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, the GSG 9, the flight crew of the German Federal Police and the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service, were at the scene of the rescue.
According to Monday night information from the ministerial spokesmen, the German forces were not needed, however, as the hostages allowed their prisoners to run and then fled when they recognized signs of a violent hostage rescue.
The assistance offered by Germany was accepted by the Egyptian Government in order to involve it as an on-site support force.
"Fortunately, this did not happen," said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The group of tourists consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian woman and eight Egyptian escorts were abducted on 19 September in the southern part of Egypt.
Following the abduction in the desert area of southern Egypt, the hostages were carried back and forth in the border areas of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostages has remained unclear so far, as well as details of the release of the hostages or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the refugees arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier has informed me that the hostages released are under the protection of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, they have not yet provided any information as to when they will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" daily newspaper, the five tourists and special forces will arrive in Germany on Tuesday on the German Air Force Airbus.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejects the rescue package.
The Lower House of the United States Congress has, by a small majority, overthrown the $700 billion rescue package proposed for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones fell into the deep end.
The US House rejected the government's rescue package to the financial markets with 227 votes against 206 votes.
Despite the calls made by US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, the programme with which the chaos on the financial markets was to be contained has not received a majority.
The supporters were desperate to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package in a dramatic operation.
Barney Frank, a negotiator of the Democratic Party, called on Members to support, even though the plan is so unpopular.
"It is difficult to obtain political support to avoid something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
Dow Jones fell over 6% and 600 points during the vote.
The investors were concerned that the state rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the vote was finished, so that it would fall again after failure was made public.
The experts are counting on further serious turbulence in international financial markets.
It is necessary to approve both the House and the Senate for the entry into force of this programme.
The directors are registering more and more reservations.
It's a good winter for the German tour operators.
According to a study, the turnover of reservations for the following months increased significantly compared to the previous year - by more than 30% for the winter season.
Despite the weak economic prospects, the German travel spirit has not been weakened according to the study.
For the winter season reservations, travel agencies booked a 31% increase in traffic compared to the previous year, presented in Berlin by the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK market research institute, the number of reservations for autumn months is already higher.
The October turnover of travel agencies was 11% higher than October 2007, which was announced by DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which assesses the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates them to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the journeys booked by the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak dollar exchange rate, the trips to the USA were particularly looking for me, said DRV.
Here, the rate of reservations has increased by a third.
Germany's particularly popular destinations are also Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic landscapes.
"Most of all," said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV, looking for organized roads.
As a result of rising energy and food costs, for organised roads, the costs are "better calculated for passengers than for individually organised trips'.
Among other things, passengers can save money with pre-booking discounts or all inclusive offers, said Laepple.
The booking rate for the summer months was also very good, so there will be a return to traffic growth compared to the previous year - although another study shows that fewer German tourists have undertaken travel compared to the previous year.
The first Oktoberfest
Uninterrupted ballermann hits, gallon beers and celebrities wearing designer dirndlit.
Debug on Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't actually look much alike.
She's blonde, she's a TV host, and she's wearing a size-cut dirndli.
My hair is dark, I'm a schoolgirl, and I bought my dress in the thrift shop.
However, one thing connects us: We are only three minutes away from Wiesnen, and the photographers are already rushing us and filling their memory cards - I am very flattered, and all this is on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems the cheap dirndli is fulfilling its purpose.
As a Wiesn tourist from white sausage to the north of the equator, my comfort is still limited by popular wear.
But when you arrive at the Theresienwies, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndli or leather pants; no one looks at me with a frown or an awkward look - everything is perfectly fine.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndly apron.
A Munich woman calls to my attention that I have misbound the apron: "You are free left, virgin in the middle, sold right, widow in the back."
Secretly, I moved the bow to the left from behind.
"That's good," he says, laughing.
Others make less fuss about fine flirtation techniques and wear a simple felt hat with "I'm too drunk to dress up" inscription and unsolicited showing their naked ass.
The young man with the exhibitionist traits is called Bob, and he visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
Which you find very fantastic, extended by "aaaaa" for a long time.
You're telling me all this after you've gotten rid of the contents of your previously drunk jar.
Right next to one of the fire hydrants that everyone sees as garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the infamous "illegals."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At 8: 00 P.M., the paramedics will go through the scene as an army party and take care of the poor couple.
The nurses always show up as a team - four of them carry a covered stretcher from tent to tent at the same time.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, departure filled.
Who lies in the liquor coffin under the tarp doesn't show.
"These are those who are fully ready," cried one of the medical staff to me in my question, and then in the roster.
Police have named the victim of the accident
The police named the 63-year-old lady who was hit by a vehicle in Essex County and died in the hospital.
The Brentwood residents of Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson, had an accident on Shenfield Road on Friday afternoon.
He was taken to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released on bail ever since.
Turkey's expanding diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey intended to join the European Union, the European powers were burning up in the desire to go deep into the Turkish backland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that's what the travel books say.
The building encircles the end of the platforms, with a tower at each front corner, and looks like some kind of German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little bumpy.
However, in view of the interior of the vault ticket office, it is clear what a large enterprise this was the most western gate.
The station was opened by the German consortium Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation in August 1908.
Germany, the "late future of conquests', with the help of this railway from Damascus to Baghdad, to Saudi Arabia today, wanted to achieve its ambitions to seize the Middle East.
The German conquest efforts collapsed during World War I.
His railroad routes were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab partisans.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British colonial army withdrew from Egypt and squeezed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
Hyderpasha Station was no better.
In 1917, a munitions train exploded and destroyed the nicely developed roof of the building.
According to Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, it's been falling apart, and history has gone way beyond that.
At the same time today, as the gateway to Anatolia and the railway to the entire eastern region, at least symbolically, it serves as the expanding diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Justice and Development Party on the Government - the AKP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is marked by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the groups of Hamas and Fatah in Palestine, with Iraq, with Iran, with the European Union and, of course, with the United States.
I wanted to assess the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I got on the night train to Ankara in Turkey to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts in the AKP, the Turkish Member of Parliament, Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of tumbling, which gave me the rhythm of the famous documentary about the old world, "The Night Mail" - I arrived in the Turkish capital. The new city is meant to be the symbol of the new secular state, which turns its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known to have Islamic roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
It caused some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I took a taxi to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern building of stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose - which is located in a developing suburban district, between semi-finished shopping centres and coffee houses. The latter meets the middle managers in suits - both men and women - to make a deal early in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have been introduced to a right-centre-based politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a suit, tie, and I'm sure he even had a Blackberry.
"The party's foreign policy aim is to help Turkey reintegrate into its immediate environment.
"The Cold War has overturned order," he said.
Turkey is isolated from its backland.
He had to turn east and west at the same time today.
He couldn't choose between the two.
He had to open both ways.
"But is it possible that sooner or later you will be forced to choose?" I asked.
"Turkey never wanted to go on a crossroads."
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here was mechanically repeating: Turkey's relations with not only the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as it is to Turkey itself.
It is as if they want to convey the message that, in metaphorically speaking, all of Europe, along with Turkey, can reach Asia and the Middle East on those railway lines heading east.
When I was back at Hydarpasha Station, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, the two German gentlemen who watched the recovery of this fine construction 100 years ago.
How would they have been surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I was waiting at the port for the ferry to take me back through the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was once called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least there was no question of which continent would claim this exciting country.
Remarkable lifestyles: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown has written: since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley has led the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Based on his musical plans for the city, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, next year.
In principle, only those under the age of 21 could have belonged to the choir, but when Proteus sang its finale in 1979 - many of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to part with the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the name of the mythological changeling) was in line with the chorus's determination and ability to cope with any music they put in front of it - whether it is madrigal or a Messiaen piece; unaccompanied or accompanied by a grand orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing and always exciting, and it was thanks to the man whose inspiration our enthusiasm for music has remained unchanged over the years.
How often Tod used to say, "let the music speak itself."
He always said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it. "
His career technique was always perfectly understandable and accurate, but never dictatorial or exaggerating.
Whatever the music standard was, he always raised on it.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If there was ever a conductor who was supposed to be a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I got to know him well in the two decades during which he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
For the past 40 years, I've been criticizing over 100 concerts, but he's never disappointed one, and he's often inspired me with them.
Tod Handley had greatness and modesty together, which is very rare.
He hated conductors who, in his words, simply "galloped with one or two well-known riders all over the world."
A lot of us are gonna miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff necrologist (25 September), "In 1946 he continued his economic history studies in Oxford, and in 1950 he was awarded a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman Research Institute... while he was constantly preparing for the basic degree, master's degree and PhD title."
This comes from the authors' notes of Woodruff's "Beyond Neb End," but it's wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, he taught an economic story at the University of Nottingham, and meanwhile, under the leadership of Professor J.D. Chambers, he completed his PhD dissertation on the British rubber industry, which was then published in 1958 under the title "The British rubber industry."
In 1950-51, he was in the United States with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at Illinois, New York and Harvard.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
There's no way to know why Woodruff was embellishing this period of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Philosophy Board
"J. Vicente Resino's exhibition" Flamenco and Life "is recommended because his black-and-white documentary-style photos are impressive.
Their simplicity and strength and respect for the people in the photographs have attracted my attention.
This exhibition can be carried through by emotions.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments. "
Second, sales record at Honda
In November, Honda will start marketing the second generation Jazz.
It is true that the passenger compartment was large enough for his predecessor, but the design of the interior of the new model is even wider.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics that make driving more comfortable and increase fuel savings.
Evolution versus revolution.
This is what the second generation of Honda Jazz looks like.
Although the sight of the new Jazz is very similar to its predecessor, many internal changes have been made to it.
These include innovative design, new body, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
But before we move to a detailed description of the new model, we have to say that the new Jazz appeared six years after the first generation was put on the market.
So, first of all, we can say that Honda has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other producers.
In Europe, even though Jazz is less known, it is breaking sales records on other markets.
For example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought-after car brand in 2002 and 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million pieces of Jazz have been sold since it was placed on the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, with nearly half a million examples sold in six years.
However, Honda wants to further increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
In other words, while in 2007, the Japanese company sold 83,000 Jazz in total, for 2009 estimates target the sale of 100,000 cars, which would result in a 17% increase in the European market.
Since 2002 on the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8000 pieces of Jazz, representing 6,7% of the total turnover of Honda in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary calculate 2000 examples sold over one year.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly alleviate the decline in Honda's turnover in Spain.
The company's representatives are predicting 22.000 copies sold by the end of this year, which is 4000 less than the 2007 figures, i.e. a 16% reduction.
Despite the conditions of sale, Honda increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1,8% compared to 1.6% last year.
By 2010, I would also like to increase this rate to 2%.
Honda hopes you can do that by introducing a new model.
This would be Insight, a hybrid with a five-door and compact size - 4370 mm long - of which the Japanese company would sell 200,000 worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's market share would be allocated by the United States, while the remaining share would be divided between the Old Continent and Japan.
The introduction of Insight in trade is due in the first months of the year after the formal presentation of Valencia planned for January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has become more extensive in every way.
Its length reaches 3900 mm (five centimeters longer), its width 1690 mm (two inches wider) and the wheelbase has increased by five centimeters, i.e. 2500 mm.
However, its height remains 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger compartment became wider.
The larger internal space is guaranteed by the new body, on the one hand, and the fuel tank in the middle, on the other hand - this solution is already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, the total cargo space of the so-called double-floor boot is increased, currently 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres higher than the capacity of the first generation.
Although this includes those dimensions for the type with the 1,4 engine, since the trunk of the 1.2 Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be found, such as rear-view lamps or optional panorama glass roof and easier access to rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, as opposed to the opening angle of the first Jazz of 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its distribution, this small model can be ordered with two engines of 1,2 and 1,4 litres.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, consumption of both resources is more favourable than its previous model and is characterised by lower carbon dioxide emissions and excellent mechanical coordination, while the engine provides outstanding performance in all respects.
The performance of the 1.2 litre resource is 90 horsepower at 6000 rpm and its maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 rpm.
This engine, which was 78 horsepower in the previous Jazz, consumes 5.3 litres and has a CO2 emission of 125 grams.
And the other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, now reaches 100 horsepower.
The 100-horsepower of 1,4-litre Jazz consumes an average of 5.4 litres and has an emission of 128 grams of CO2.
The non-collision "bee car"
For the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has inspired its new invention from nature, precisely from the world of bees.
The Japanese company designed a robot to avoid accidents by mimicking the flying of bees.
The Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C may be the first step in developing anti-collision technologies.
Engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Advanced Technical Center have built this small robot in Japan in cooperation with the Advanced Science and Technology Research Centre of the famous University of Tokyo.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Technology PRand Research Development Mark Director, the BR23C is a further extension of the four-level safety barrier of Nissan.
The robot makes the company's product more complete to avoid impact.
When flying, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety barrier.
However, there is a more important role to play in the complex eye of the uterus, with which it can see at an angle of more than 300 degrees in each direction. Consequently, it can fly in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the composite eye, engineers designed a so-called laser remote meter (Laser Range Finder).
The apparatus identifies obstacles in a 180-degree field of vision before the BR23C, calculates their distance, and sends a signal to the onboard microprocessor, which is immediately converted into an operation to avoid impact.
"As soon as the barrier is detected, the small robot, imitating the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by moving the wheels at a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The main thing that distinguishes the system from the instruments currently available is that in this case the evasive manoeuvre takes place completely automatically.
If not, the robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles, "explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobility Laboratory and Chief Engineer of the project.
In a way other than bees, the evasive manoeuvre shall not be directed upwards or downwards, nor shall it move diagonally, in only two dimensions and only towards the invertification of the wheels, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in a way, as in the case of bees.
In addition to acceleration and deceleration, Nissan also used a rotation function in the robot to avoid collisions.
"This structure only needs to process and respond to data every few seconds.
There is no need to store data or intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvres, so it can operate without interruption with just a few dozen KB memories.
This may sound surprising, but it's not gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte-sized memories.
This is the first step in the development of immediate collision prevention technology that Nissan estimates can enter serial-made cars within 10 years.
The robot operates with lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and durable than lithium-ion.
In the future, the integration of the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system may be an additional way of using it to deliver the car to its destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Treasury Department, beyond the fact that it has a lot of money to invest, has no common sense.
Since the crisis is upon them, and so that Americans do not fall into the maze of questionable mortgage banks, they have created a fun and informative online game called "Bad Credit Hotel."
This is "The Bad Loan Hotel..." which means "the Hicks."
The appearance of the accommodation and especially of the receptionist's melancholy suggests that we should think again, twice, or even three times, whether the time for borrowing has actually just come.
And especially where to apply for credit, which is probably the purpose of this thing.
The information on this website is indeed useful, but it is not detailed.
It's more for teenagers than for the public.
But what would happen if we added the game?
For example, the hotel would show up in our dream room.
Actually, that's something, because we can't even dream about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that it would provide a share in its capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after the Morgan Stanley shares fell heavily on the stock market.
One week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares at a unit price of $25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price shall be more than 19% less than the book value of the securities on 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities, which will give it a 10% return, and their exchange rate will be USD 31,25.
According to Morgan Stanley, when carrying out the global transaction, an average exchange rate of $29 is used, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock price dropped by 6,79% in the middle of the week around 17: 00 in Greenwich, closing at $23.07.
"This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up its transformation into a banking company," explains John Mack, CEO of the US Group.
Morgan Stanley approved the new status last week, which allows it to diversify its activities, while at the same time being controlled by the Federal Reserve.
The agreement with MUFG reaffirms once again that the current financial crisis requires even greater caution from the companies listed in Wall Street.
The terms announced on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in recent days: last Monday Morgan announced that 20% of its shares would be sold to the Japanese company for approximately $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, we thought that the share would be wholly made up of ordinary shares," said Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG in Tokyo.
"However, due to the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and prevent potential risks."
With regard to the weighted average price, MUFG pays 7% more than the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return per share is reduced by around 20%.
Under the agreement, MUFG may transfer half of its preference shares to ordinary shares after one year if the trading price of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a specified period, i.e. it rises to around 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from the MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquid resources.
However, the spokesperson of the group did not wish to provide accurate information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
Following MUFG's entry, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase Tier I's solvency rate by about 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan has declared that its balance sheet has "definitely" improved since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been a great ordeal for the group, as the stock price has fallen to half, while the cost of providing it against the risk of default has skyrocketed.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but it remained high at around 12%.
The only remaining "survivor" of the large investment banks remained after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch. This is Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that it had received $15 billion: part of this came from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa's Monday statement, Quito
Rebuilding the Republic in the spirit of 21st century socialism.
This is the joint plan for Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales, Venezuela, and Rafael Correa, Ecuador.
Following the model of his fellow presidents and friends, Correa presented his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
He succeeded in his mission, as 64% of the voters voted in favour of the referendum according to official results, which covered 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted no, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% were unfilled by voters.
The adoption of the draft Constitution required 50% + 1 vote.
On Sunday, both the surveys at the exit of the polling offices and the counting by a civilian organisation have demonstrated the enormous superiority of the votes' yes' with a rate of 63% and 70% respectively.
By the way, Rafael Correa was already talking about the victory of his draft constitution on the night of Sunday to Monday.
"The Constitution was an overwhelming victory," he said, and thanked the Ecuador at the headquarters of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As is well known, Rafael Correa has been congratulated by Chávez, Morales and the Chilean presidents, Michelle Bachelet.
According to the report of the OAS observation mission, the vote took place in a calm atmosphere. Its main theme was a 444-point text, which summed up the principles of "new socialism" protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution places state power in the service of the economy, while maintaining the right of the State to design "development 'for a country that essentially lives from oil extraction by foreign companies and foreign currency sent by emigrants.
The draft Constitution of Correa, which was elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the head of state, who can obtain a mandate for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to the dissolution of the Parliament.
Correa has already announced that she wishes to take advantage of this opportunity and will re-compete for the Head of State mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also included the freedom of health services and education. The President has already started to introduce this in his country, which has 13.9 million inhabitants and half of the population is living below the minimum.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of the US anti-drugs facility in Ecuador.
They freed the 19 hostages in Chad.
Egyptian commando raided the kidnappers who took 11 tourists and eight of their escorts hostage ten days ago.
The hostages are now in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for 10 days, from which they were transported unharmed to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad by an Egyptian commando this morning.
In good condition, apparently, they arrived at the Al-Maza military base around 4: 30 p.m., directly linked to the international airport in Cairo.
The hostages were forbidden to comment to the press, and immediately moved to a hospital in the suburbs of Cairo in Maadi, where they were examined.
The hostages are "healthy" and "no ransom was paid to the kidnappers," said the Egyptian tourist minister Zoheir Garanna at the airport.
On September 19, the hostages were taken prisoner at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border areas of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they were involved in an SUV safari, and the group was then carried from one shelter to another by the 35 unknown hostages.
In the group there were 11 tourists (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian woman), and eight Egyptians: two tour guides, four drivers, one border guard and director of the Aegyptous travel agency organising safari.
According to an Egyptian head of security, a special commando of 30 arrived on two helicopters on the scene, where they raided the hostages immediately before dawn.
Half the kidnappers were killed, the others fled, "said the leader asking for his name to be silenced.
He also said that a total of 150 special forces were sent from the Egyptian Lightning Brigade to Sudan, where German and Italian commandos were added.
The Italian diplomatic leader Franco Frattini, who is currently in Belgrade, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
"We have to admit that this result could not have been achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service men and action groups," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of ransom for the hostages.
On the day before, the Sudanese army announced that an SUV was detained while patrolling, on which the kidnappers traveled, six of them were killed (including the Chad leader) and two were arrested.
According to the military, the hostages were involved with a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which was immediately betrayed by the organization concerned.
Lettres - The "silent majority of culture"
News and the election campaign that is currently taking place are currently at the heart of the debate on the financing of culture.
We can only be happy about that.
But a piece of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will raise their word to highlight the ridiculous amounts of money being managed by small museums, archives, archaeological excavations and national historical monuments on the verge of starvation?
Which politician dares to remind the federal government that he doesn't care about his monuments and buildings that form part of his cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government only spent three and a half million euros to restore Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of American culture, and this heritage must be protected in a coordinated manner by all citizens, elected representatives and all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Québec Association of Historical Societies (Fédération des sociétés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40 000 volunteers from 211 companies dealing with history, cultural heritage, archives and genealogy work on history research and the preservation of large numbers of private archives and archaeological artifacts with minimal budgets.
Often these organizations protect our heritage with tooth and nail and protest with the last power of the drowning when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers towards our old buildings and forgotten cemetery.
When are you going to stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
They nationalize part of Fortis Bank by Benelux governments
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux States are helping the US credit market crisis, as a first European, in the Belgian-Dutch bank, Fortis: the three countries support the financial and insurance institution with an interest in Hungary with a total of EUR 11,2 billion.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch governments discussed the matter at the highest level at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission in charge of competition.
In the euro area, Fortis Bank has the first major crisis in the waves in the context of an international financial market crisis that has been around for over a year, and decisions on the bank can therefore, in some respects, be regarded as precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will purchase the bank's existing assets in close half (49%).
The bank will certainly sell some of its interests, including, above all, activities purchased from ABN Amro, the Netherlands last year, mainly insurance companies.
Fortis's stock started a steep fall last week, and in the second half of the week, there were serious crisis phenomena at the institute.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with an employee of 85 thousand, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The company's papers only fell by about 12% on Friday, to 14-year-old depths.
Since January, the value of the shares has decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the company managers, this is not realistic.
By the way, the management blamed the overseas market uncertainty regarding the adoption of the US package plan of $700 billion on the fall in Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers went up slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx, a new CEO, was appointed to head the bank.
The financial institution has also been looking for private customers, but no one has made a substantial offer so far.
The Belgian Government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry or lose their money.
The bank's clients have not had any panic, the accounts have not been attacked.
Fortis has an independent account in Hungary and has also purchased leasing companies.
Fox in a henhouse
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to enter into insurance contracts with the applicant based on people's drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a data protection programme that binds the use of prescription data to the consent of the person concerned in all cases.
This should be in independent hands, otherwise we leave the foxes to the foxes, "quoting Richard Dick, the developer of the program for the follow-up of prescription drugs, Washington Post.
Insurance companies shall make the insurance premiums and the amount due in the event of damage dependent on the health status of the applicant client and shall not take insurance if they consider the risk to be too high.
In the past, the person was sent for medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the light of the results of the investigation.
Dick has invented a much cheaper procedure for ten years: he can easily obtain from pharmacies, based on the customer's identification number, the drugs he's been buying for the past year and a half, and the program itself concludes what kind of illness he's suffering from and what his medical condition is.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol suppressant, it suggests that your blood fat level is virtually unmanageable, which immediately classifies it as a higher risk.
There are several versions of the programme on the market, some of them also set a risk factor, so the insurance company will have little work to do outside the paperwork, although small difficulties arise.
The disadvantages include that some medicines may be used for several purposes, such as against migraines or heat waves, but are also effective against depression.
The latter is considered to be a significant risk-raising factor for business insurers, not the latter.
They formed separate companies to retrieve and process the data, and they, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask the patient for consent.
They are now bound by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are already processing the results of laboratory tests and linking them to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the monitoring of the use at the same time will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but it covers only healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before Congress, there is a bill that gives the authorities control over companies specialising in the provision of data.
Dick Richard understands that this is not enough: that is why he has further developed his programme, which would tie the data to the explicit consent of the data subject.
Another question is that the person concerned may hardly refuse to contribute, otherwise the insurance companies will not enter into a contract with him.
So the hens are somewhat dependent on the kindness of the fox.
Global Marseille menu
Double trade between the European Union and India
As the European Union and India are mutually leading trading partners, the agenda for the ninth summit was also dominated by this theme, in addition to the rest of the global problems.
Today, there will also be a French-Indian summit, where nuclear cooperation will be the main issue.
Although the European Union recognises that India is an ascending democratic power that should be given greater say in international affairs, Member States have not yet managed to reach common ground, to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was therefore not pushed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President-in-Office of the Union, and Commission President José Manuel Barroso and High Representative for Foreign Affairs Javier Solana, adopted the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who was also agreed to double the trade turnover in five years, i.e. to increase trade turnover to EUR 100 billion.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious objective.
In this context, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India have been legally co-ordinated, which means that air traffic can fly in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the consultation.
The aim is to balance the fact that while the EU India's number one trading partner, New Delhi, is in the ninth place only in the EU's partners.
The summit has devoted its attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as terrorism, was condemned on both sides in all its forms and urged to convene the UN Conference.
The end of the Doha trade round was also called for, although both of them have a large part of the failure so far.
The EU has confirmed its persistence in its energy and climate programme, which means that it wants to reduce emissions by at least 20% by 2020.
This was also agreed by India, as was the need to make a global deal at the climate conference to come next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and support the call for an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where at the bilateral meeting he intends to make a deal on peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, they hope that the French companies will be entrusted with the construction of Indian nuclear reactors with a value of EUR 20 billion.
News agency reports that the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishing books in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented with a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishing houses will be present at the most important international copyright meeting at the 60th Buchmesse Fair.
This year's Frankfurt International Book Fair is expecting 7 000 exhibitors from 101 countries, with an area of 171.790 square metres, where more than 403,000 books will be presented. The guest of honor will be Turkey.
At the opening ceremony of the Italian Pavilion, the Italian Government will be represented by Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Culture Javas and Activities: Italy will take over 264 square metres of exhibition space by setting up a single Italia Point.
The opening will be followed by a press conference in the room "Room Structur" of the 5.0 pavilion of Buchmesse, where there will be an opportunity to present information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian publishing.
According to the data, the Italian publishing market continues to reduce the proportion of foreign authors, especially in the area of adult and youth publications.
They found the plane of the billionaire, Steve Fossett, who disappeared a year ago.
They found the remains of the billionaire Steve Fossett's plane, who disappeared on September 3, 2007 above the Nevada desert.
The wreckage was found on a 3,000-metre-tall plateau in the Sierra Nevada Mountains on the border of California and Nevada, near Mammoth Lakes.
No human remains were found inside the plane.
John Anderson, the sheriff of Madera County, cleared up all the doubts that still existed: "After determining the position of the plane, we sent out a team, and now we can be sure it's the plane Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that there were no human remains found in the plane or surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The US Transport Safety Agency (NTSB) stated that a committee of inquiry was requested a few hours after the wreck was discovered, which was able to identify the machine and that it was indeed the Bellanca 8kcab that disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fossett left for a three-hour flight from Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, too, in California, near the Nevada border, a couple found some of Fossett's personal belongings near his home in Mammoth Lakes.
Two I.D.s for Fosset, issued by the Illinois FAA, some cash and a sweater.
Fossett's search was dispatched a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up several peaks to put himself in history.
In 2002, in the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the ground with a balloon: two weeks of solo flying.
Three years later, he flew around the land without landing.
He has several records of flying above the Andes at an altitude of 15.445 meters, performed with a co-pilot.
GLK, Stupendous Advertising
It's an unusual, but original, and definitely formatted hobby with large surfaces and clean corners.
In a few words, this is the latest "compact SUV" of Mercedes-Benz, with which the German car company tried to bring fresh momentum to the market.
It is precisely because of this traditional content that the introduction campaign of the SUV GLK available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms will also be surprising and unusual as of 17 October.
The advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle has been using an unknown media communication device, including utopian 3D posters that have not been used in Italy by car brand.
The billboard action, consisting of three stages, will rule Milan's central shopping street, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of media communication starts with the spatial presentation of the car, which will show the new SUV, with special glasses distributed around Corso Como, almost in real size and in three-dimensional form.
The person who looks at the picture will feel like the car is coming out of the poster.
Then, using innovative elumina8 technology, each detail of the new GLK becomes visible one by one so that it can come together as a single image.
There is no doubt that Mercedes, with this promotion, is trying to introduce something new into the stereotype advertising world of the automotive industry.
Will it be possible to attract the interest of prospective customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're young people from Triveneto, probably locked out of orbit.
But who is this 150-200 boys and girls who are now ashamed of all of Italy? They are members of the group called "Ultras Italia," which has been following the team for years, and which, in fact, has not been very much of a problem so far.
They never collided with the opponent's fans.
The core of the group is right-wing.
The chief organizers are coming from Trivento.
And Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udina.
These were joined by smaller scattered groups from Campania and Puglia in Sofia (in fact only a few units).
They were waving Italian flags, which were marked by fans' hometown: they were taken off on Saturday so they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, you were faced with a real Nazi cheerleading team, the Levski fans.
The Italian Football Association has provided 144 tickets to the Italian fans, which were name-calling tickets, so it's easier to check the cheerleading team.
The Ministry of the Interior also checked everyone: there was no one who was going to be prosecuted, no one who was banned from visiting the stadium.
Four Italian fans with a record related to football refused tickets and leave.
At present, the Ministry of Interior is waiting for protocols from the Sofia police department, and then takes the necessary measures: those fans who were arrested or identified during the riots may also be banned for five years.
It is an international ban, which concerns not only visits to Italy but also to all European stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't set foot in any football field.
Fortunately.
But we also have to fear that the hooligans will find followers, or that they will join only one hundred and fifty of them.
"This fire must be suppressed immediately," said the Ministry of the Interior.
So we'd better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesday's pick day is coming up in Lecce.
In Puglia, there is a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
Tomorrow, the Monitoring Service, and on Tuesday, the Committee on the Safety of Sports Events, which can count on a section of the Homeland Security Service, the secret services dealing with cheerleading behaviour.
"Scan Duce-Duce and swing arm under the Italian anthem? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime..."
This thought was expressed in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzilli, who was appointed as head of the Ministry of Interior observation service a few weeks ago (the post was occupied by Francesco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was before that chief of police in Trieste, the city where there has been a cell supporting the Ultras Italy group since 2002.
What Mazzilli says is true, there is no ban on feeding Duce in Bulgaria, but the behaviour of that 150-200 fan was still shameful.
I'm not a sociologist, he added the first man in the observation service, but the crimes must be judged in the country where the crime was committed.
Until now, this group has not been a problem; we need to look at exactly what happened and consider how to proceed.
But let's talk a little bit about the Italian anthem whistling: it's not a crime, but if I may say so, it's not a good manners either. "
