The Prague Stock Exchange went to Minus at the end of the trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses after the crash this morning.
Transactions in shares of the Czech Energy Company (ČEZ) amounted to nearly half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued its fall on Monday right from the start of Tuesday's trade when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street's stock is behind the decline.
This is how the market's reaction to the outcome of the US House vote, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Fall of shares in Asia
The Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall in shares on Tuesday, although during the day, some of the losses were finally cancelled.
The Hong Kong Sound Seng Stock Exchange Index wrote down almost four percent during trading, but later cancelled part of the losses and reduced the decrease to around 2.5 percent.
The Hong Kong Stock Exchange's Voice Seng China Enterprises Index dropped 3.8% and the markets in Shanghai were closed.
The stock market in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwanese Stock Exchange's index says it's down 3.6%.
"The timing of the American rescue operation is uncertain and affects the world's financial markets," said Joseph Yam, head of the Hong Kong Financial Council.
Hong Kong, although it is part of China, defines its financial policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as those of the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American legislators should reopen negotiations immediately and accept the financial system's support proposal.
Otherwise, other countries are threatening to feel the consequences of this.
The bloodbath of American shares
On Monday, the American House rejected the draft financial system support, for which 700 billion dollars (almost 12 trillion kroner) should have been spent.
The legislators have therefore ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the entire economy.
On Monday, the American shares suffered a bloodbath and the leading stock index recorded the biggest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones fell by almost seven percent, and the last time he experienced a similar fall was 1987.
The index was already before the vote, but as it turns out that the proposal was not adopted in the House, the index started to fall free.
Congress has withdrawn: The US government is now able to pump $700 billion into banks
The major leaders of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement and financial assistance to the US financial system.
This will be voted on at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators have made a breakthrough in the negotiations for the approval of the rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the US financial system amounting to USD 700 billion (around USD 12 billion).
But there is no victory yet.
Congress must complete some details of the agreement before they can make the final form and vote of the law public.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the House on Monday.
On Sunday, the Reuters News Agency was informed by Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Organisations Committee.
According to Senate sources, the draft is likely to be voted on as soon as Wednesday.
Economists believe it should be a notification that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor in the revival of financial markets.
However, due to the complexity of the mechanisms, "sobriety" will then take place.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We've taken a big step.
We have resolved our differences regarding the form of the package to stabilise the market, "mentioned the Bloomberg Agency to the Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
According to him, the final vote may take place on Sunday.
The representatives of the legislators met with Henry Paulson, the American Minister of Finance, Saturday night to give the government a final form.
This should buy from financial companies the indivisible mortgage assets that put financial corporations in serious losses and threaten the stability of the whole system.
"We are close to the final agreement on a draft that will work and which must also be effective on the market.
The bill for improvement needs to be continued, but I think we're there, "said Paulson.
Indication to Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on stock markets, which fall violently.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the legislators are therefore seeking to settle in Congress for good on Sunday.
This is to reassure investors before trading in Asian financial markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress's decision could first influence Monday's trade.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the American Congress are voting on the law, and it is not clear whether the trial can be stopped at the last minute because of a problem.
The legislators are hoping that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is still going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which is set at an additional USD 100 billion and USD 350 billion later, if it feels that the programme does not fulfil its function.
Bush assessed progress in the negotiations
Although the President may veto this resolution, Congress may overrule its veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the programme, which was the acquisition of material assets for the purchase of bad mortgage securities that lost their value, was preserved because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to repay their mortgage loans.
"We've worked everything out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday and the Senate on Monday, "said the Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
With the progress made in the negotiations, President Bush is also pleased.
Tony Fratto, the spokesperson for Bush, stated that the president was satisfied with the progress made on Saturday and appreciates the 'two-party efforts to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy'.
Limitation of pay-per-view severance payments
The President of the Senate Bank Committee, Christopher Dodd, leading the negotiations, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility for the financial programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the draft financing.
The new law also limits the so-called bushy severance payments of the directors involved in the programme and establishes a committee to monitor the fund.
The fund should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on this, and we have made great progress towards an agreement that will work and which will be useful to all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also includes assistance to homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new repayment instalments for the mortgages it buys, with the aim of reducing the monthly instalments of the debtors and allowing them to keep their houses.
Marek: Spiritual aid
The proposed draft is a good idea according to David Marek, chief economist at Patria Finance, but it will be very difficult to implement.
"All this because there is no way to know what mechanism and what price will be bought into the problem.
This will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government divide losses between themselves, "said the week iHNed.cz to Marek.
Marek says it's not that important that the plan be approved now or at the beginning of next week.
"It is more important that Congress decide this week to support the plan and give their blessing as soon as possible.
The spiritual importance of agreeing that the plan will be approved is the most important thing at this moment, "stressed Marek.
On the edge of a duel: MP3 players versus cell phones.
We'll help you choose
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can be used to call.
It makes it clear that it's better to just buy a phone.
However, there are a lot of reasons why you can get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the needs of the prospective owner.
It's probably hard to get high-quality high-quality record players at home to listen to the latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on vinyl plates, but there are no objective reasons for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if his shelves are full of art rock, jazz or blues vinyl plates, he probably dreams of such a record player.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified by MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories here.
For some, it may be unacceptable to give eight thousand kroner for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan probably finds it difficult to accept a 20-crown market earpiece.
Two extremities between which everyone has plenty of room.
There's a wide selection.
The life of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players are capable of much more than simply playing music, but also of which most of the phones are not by any chance.
No current device is as universal as a phone.
In addition to primary functions, phone and text, you can play music and video, record both, have a better-worse camera, even navigate.
And if you consider the smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a little miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can take pictures.
A number of cell phones have their drawbacks.
The more features you use on your phone, the more the display sends to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy invaders.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than 10-12 hours, mostly this is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly higher in performance.
That's why you can count on cheap cell phones not to play for you for more than a few hours.
Even if you call here and there, get a charger to your workplace just to be safe - this also applies to more expensive appliances.
The MP3 players will not have this problem, even the worse ones will be able to operate at least 9 hours continuously with one upload.
The next problem arises when the music is uploaded to mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has a universal USB outlet and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with miniature memory cards used in cell phones without an adapter.
Players do not need any special software with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough to upload the device from the computer with music through USB.
The majority of cell phones and players are already creating a music library in order based on the artist, the album, the genre name, or, for example, the user's evaluation.
Some devices represent only a structure similar to Windows Explorer, and some know both (iliver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to handle, cell phones know more
For the selection of the specific equipment, ask first and foremost about battery life, memory capacity, sound output quality and type, and, of course, the comfort of treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and you only listen to it on the tram for a short time a day, for example, any mobile that plays MP3 will suit you.
And that's what any cell phone can do.
You don't even have to pay particular attention to the music formats the mobile or player can do.
The MP3 will be dealt with by all and the vast majority of the music that comes to you will be in exactly this format.
MP3 is one of the most common and the vast majority of devices also cope with WMA.
The AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPod) is less likely to occur.
Better mobile phones also allow you to buy on-line music, for example.
It is enough to visit the right pages of the service provider (or other service provider) via the mobile Internet and buy the song or album.
This service itself can be a strong argument for the purchase of a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is lousy and is generally limited to annual radio stations.
Prices aren't the lowest.
In general, however, it can be assumed that such a way of selling music (whether on GSM, Internet or wireless) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people keep their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you want to listen to something, you can feel your cell phone in your pocket while your forgotten MP3 player is at home.
However, it also depends on whether you always carry your headphones or at least your speakers.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker with almost every mobile but only few MP3 players.
For many, the most likely advantage of musical cell phones will be the price.
The cheapest usually cost less than 3,000 kroner.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can buy enough decent Walkman.
Most of the time, however, you are limited by the lack of traditional earphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones with traditional 3,5 mm diameter headphones can cost up to 15,000 kroner.
The advantage of players, however, is simple handling.
The simplest - certainly not necessarily the cheapest players (see our selection) can really be dealt with.
The minimum function is obvious, the handling of a previously standard cassette recorder or gramophone.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of the accidentally activated mobile Internet, nor is there a huge account for the transfer of data.
What device to select
The cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) have usually openings to interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
You can buy the right card for up to 2,000 kroner.
Be careful, though.
The base types only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB or less.
Only the most expensive can do with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a cell phone and you want to buy a cheap MP3 player, choose Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
On the basis of capacity (up to 2 GB), you do not have to spend more than 1 100 kroner.
If you belong to the more demanding students, choose special mobile walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices have a separate MP3 control button, thus the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson was the furthest in the sector, whose Walkman-series cell phones have the same user interface as the MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above-mentioned brands can provide the same service in the same price range up to 4,000 kroner, but with higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider will reach the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers offer virtually the same services as their Western European partners.
However, we are missing something here - a virtual provider that forces classic service providers to reduce prices.
Maybe it won't be for long.
On Mobil.cz, we have often said that Czech service providers are among the most expensive in Europe.
Furthermore, this was confirmed by ČTU, which pointed out that the text was more expensive in the Czech Republic than in the rest of the Union.
After the last step by the European Commission, the regulation of roaming charges may therefore result in a contradictory situation - texts sent abroad to some Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than those of the home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that really wants to fight.
This may sound contradictory, because we have three mobile networks and our penetration is above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators are happy to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
This is often agreed by Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Telekom Office, who said a few times earlier that there is no place for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider with its own network probably does not have much chance (however, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - the virtual provider.
It was precisely the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market that brought significant price reductions, and then the classical service providers had to react.
In the meantime, even before the entry into the market of large fish such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile in Great Britain, there were voices similar to ours.
However, it has been shown that such service providers have a place and can be truly successful.
However, for example, we don't have to go too far.
This February we informed you about Mobilking's virtual service provider's departure in Poland.
This service provider has managed to obtain more than 100 000 customers and become the fifth largest service provider there in less than six months.
Meanwhile, Mobilking is behind the Penta financial group, which is the owner of the U: line in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much smaller target group.
In order to operate effectively, you need a lot less customers than the traditional service provider.
It does not involve relatively high costs of construction, mobile network operation and maintenance.
Virtual service providers in the world usually show up as low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which are often compensated by fewer services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in Great Britain offers texts that are at least 50% cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be a pretty good move to bet on a target group.
This service provider is specifically focused on men.
"Real men choose the Mobilking Service - who they like, who they can trust," says David Seibert, CEO of this virtual service provider, Mobile Entertainment Company.
It's hard to tell if a vision like Poland can work for us.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesperson for Vodafone, doubts: "The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach, which is based on the majority of virtual service providers.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied from the point of view of the supply of services. '
There is no chance in the Czech Republic, claimed by mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but conciliation in the Czech Republic does not seem to be very hopeful.
Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region, "said Jana Studničkova, spokesperson for the Penta financial group, in his interview with Mobil.cz.
It has indirectly demonstrated that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not very sympathetic to this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to ensure that no potential competition can be established.
For some time now, the GTS Novera group has stopped hiding its interest in the launch of the virtual service provider, which is to take another step in order to make Telesica O2 a real competitor in the company's customer field.
"We are very interested in providing our customers not only wired but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner the better.
This possibility has been renegotiated with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations, "says Pavel Kaidl, spokesperson for the group.
Maybe now's a better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider could be lucky by the end of the year.
But for the time being, his birth is surrounded by a wall of impenetrable silence.
"At this moment, we do not believe that a full-fledged virtual service provider should be placed on the Czech market.
Unlike other markets, the Czech market is very special.
So far, we have not been invited by an unequal subject offering a complex and serious project in this area, "he mentioned to Mobil.cz about the press department of Vlastimil Sršeă, Telefónica 02.
The specific situation of the Czech market is also referred to by the other operators.
Martina Kemrová, the spokesperson for T-Mobile, with the exception of O2, adds: "We have not yet recorded any viable and double-sided business projects that could be further funded."
And he added: "In the T-Mobile network by the end of the year, it is unlikely that any virtual service provider will show up.
At this point, we should have a specific agreement on our table to think about in the short term. "
Vodafone will focus its attention on meeting its own 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual service providers, especially in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is what we consider to be the most rewarding in terms of clients.
The main strategy of Vodafone is to find partners in this area to build networks shared with fast mobile Internet. '
Responsible offices - on a string with service providers
The procedure of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another service provider would mean an increase in competition, a decrease in prices and a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competition to enter?
When the service providers have something important, they are able to cooperate, they are also testifying to the string around the birth of the U: line.
The biggest pressure on ČTU was probably around the birth of the T-Mobile company's U: thread.
The publicly available information from the ČTU website shows this.
But right now, the U: phone is a good argument as to why we should not allow the entry of the virtual service provider.
Martina Kemrová added: "The environment of the competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by the access of the fourth mobile operator to the market.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player to the market and its services would impose high requirements. '
In view of this attitude of mobile operators, however, the complete lack of interest of the Czech regulatory bodies is absolutely astonishing.
In the meantime, it is not only the attitude of ČTU, which unfortunately has no right to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
Only the Economic Competition Office is entitled to do so.
However, the office is typical of the whole problem.
"The entry of a virtual service provider into a mobile market would be possible only after the contract between a mobile service provider and a virtual service provider is concluded to lease the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, since the offer of potential interested parties was unlikely to be of interest to traditional operators, "he said, answering our question, Kristián Chlapua, of the External Relations Department of the Economic Competition Office.
A statement made in this way would probably not surprise anyone from the representatives of the service providers.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and also make sure that no one can abuse their position on the market, this is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristian Chalupa adds: "Foreign countries, where virtual service providers usually operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in the price of mobile telephony services'.
However, it is likely that the interests of UOHS do not include pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the price reduction.
In this case, it is indeed shocking to see a very touching harmony from the reaction of the three mobile operators.
The question whether it is a coincidence is almost self-evident.
As with the filling stations, the exact same gas prices are probably just the work of chance and tough competition.
"The Office did not discover any signs of anti-competitive proceedings in this case, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a leading position, i.e. a more proportionate responsibility for their market activities.
The means necessary to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing for the telecommunications regulator, "said Chalupa.
The presentation of the leading position on the market is one of many points of dispute.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČÖG, on the basis of which telecommunications is the only market from the point of view of economic competition.
Of course, no Czech operator is in a leading position in such a market.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - the approval of the network operator is always required for the creation of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile provider, relatively logically, has a monopoly on its own network.
So it's necessarily dominant in a particular segment.
However, even if we did not accept this argument, it should be a minimum warning for UOHS that three mobile operators are acting remarkably in the same way.
In the meantime, complaints from interested parties (including GTS Novera, which has already been mentioned) show that they face very similar obstacles during negotiations with all service providers.
The transfer of responsibility to ČTU is a relatively common trick in telecommunications with which UOHS takes its hands off the entire case.
We've seen this before in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of ČTU in the field of economic competition could not be carried through in telecommunications, although many experts were hoping to improve the situation.
The representatives of UOHS need to know this well, but they probably have different interests.
It works when no one's watching.
Meanwhile, the operation of some kind of pseudo-virtual service providers, many of which already operate in the Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies issuing their own mobile telephone service price lists, which are, however, only partially public.
We're talking about multi-annual marketing companies.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually only go to the selected ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic company client against the provider, which orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As a senior customer, you will then receive special offers (and other discounts).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit similar pre-recruitment.
"If there were cases of which you are talking, there could be a breach of contract conditions which we would be dealing with and which could lead to the completion of cooperation with that company," he answered our question about this problem to Martina Kemrova.
However, it is highly unlikely that news of this kind of activity would not have reached the responsible people of mobile operators.
In particular, there may be thousands of customers in the case of the three companies mentioned.
In the meantime, no provider will defend against such a procedure.
They do not have negligible profits from the activities of these companies and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not pose a particular threat to their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: "The law allows similar speculation, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card is not listed in their names in their phones, so they cannot fully have it as the general customers of mobile operators. '
But that's exactly what the CBI should be weird about.
In addition, another question arises for UOHS.
If mobile operators turn a blind eye to similar procedures, why are they blocking the birth of the virtual service provider?
It should be added that UOHS has a relatively strong power to uncover such an activity, and if it does not want to do so, it does not need to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that they have not suspected anything of doing so and that their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers into the mobile market has resulted in a noticeable price reduction in services.
In the meantime, in virtually all countries where virtual service providers were created, classical service providers have tried to prevent them from being created more or less.
The arguments they used were practically the same - too small, possibly too satisfied market, problems with the quality of services etc.
In the developed countries, however, the regulatory bodies intervened at this very moment, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
Then, even with formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved the creation of the first virtual service provider followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are giving each other the whole case.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that indefinite competencies are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really coming to us soon, the Czech mobile market may be on the move again.
If a provider would allow the creation of a virtual mobile service provider, it is difficult for UOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of further interested parties.
And we may not be making more expensive calls than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four processes of the new version of the Czech state anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek celebrated the new recordings of the state anthem of my country on the day of the Czech State.
The anthem was recorded by the National Theatre band, led by Jiří Bělohlavek.
There are four versions - male or female singers, singers or instrumental ones.
Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka are singing.
Authors Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček of the anthem.
You can hear all four versions on iHNed.cz.
Bělohlavek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful anthem.
He has already told the Czech Radio that he has deliberately chosen young singers with a representative voice to sing out the versions that are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to take care of the pure order, the clarity of the text and the consistency of the text," he said.
The Czech state anthem is celebrating its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Where is my country?" was first heard in 1834 by Josef Kajetán Tyl Fidlojčka in addition to František Škroup's music.
It became popular, and people spontaneously considered it their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state anthem after Czechoslovakia was founded in 1918.
Even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic, the seven State symbols remained one of them.
What a new anthem
The Prague Transport Company is also delivering chip cards for the first time on Wednesday.
1 October 2008 describes itself as the date of the history of Prague Transport Company when the first passenger to enter the metro, tram and buses will have an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper line.
The coupon is currently available to about 100,000 people with the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase 30 days and 90 days and annual coupons (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and, at the same time, save them on their chip card at the Muzeum, Måstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons can be purchased online from yesterday via the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 clients until afternoon.
Those who start using internet commerce can permanently forget the subway stations' publishing windows, where they have had to stand regularly for long lines.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and saved on the Opencard card in one of the thirteen branches of the City Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a counter with trained servers who help interested parties purchase online and save their purchased coupons on their cards," said Martin Opatrný, spokesperson for the project.
In addition to the libraries, the electronic coupons will also be available for Opencard in self-service machines equipped in some lobby.
What do these vending machines look like?
They're red, they remind me of ticket handlers, and the passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are now five of them in the city, but there should be 80 by the end of the year," added Opatrný.
The coupon is automatically checked instead of the driver
Their operation tomorrow's start-up machines are easy to handle.
Just insert the Opencard chip card, and the coupon you paid earlier will be saved by itself.
From tomorrow, electronic coupons will apply not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So on trains and bus lines around the city from 300 to 499, which are mainly used by residents of the Central Czech Republic to travel to the capital.
"On Prague integrated transport trains, the guides were equipped with card readers to determine the zone validity of coupons," explained the verification of the lines with Filip Drápal from the Ropid organisation that compiled the Prague public transport schedule.
In buses around the city, card readers are installed at the cashier's office.
When boarding, the driver must not only show the chip card, but also place Opencard at the specified location on the cash register side.
This is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons.
"For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, the easiest way to ask the driver to do so," he added Dram.
Passengers who do not travel with buses around the city and will not remember when their coupon will expire may go back to self-service machines that save coupons on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is displayed here on the display of the equipment.
The Sudetes wanted a referendum from the United States.
In 1945, the Sudeta Germans asked for the accession of Šumava to the United States.
This is from the letter in the collection of the South Czech Science Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, at least we want to live under the United States of America's cartridge.
It is said that this wish was made in 1945 by some groups of Sudeta Germans to the President of the United States.
This can also be seen from a letter from the private archives, which is now kept in the collection of the South Czech Science Library.
In the letter, the Germans of Česky Krumlov ask the President of the United States not to allow the re-return of the "county of Šumava 'to the Czech Republic, which was still occupied by Hitler under the Munich Treaty.
"The situation has been interpreted correctly and we really want to be sure in the words that American troops are certainly not coming to the German territories as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," in the letter, "People who bear the fate of Šumava in their hearts," signed.
As the attachment to Czechoslovakia to the Sudeta Germans is supposed to give hope only for brutality, merciless, ununderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protectorate "now and forever" over Šumva.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the opinion of four million inhabitants, this area would be regarded as a foreign country for us, which suppresses and destroys the minority, and would contribute almost nothing to the victory of the allies," it stands in the letter.
The reason the authors couldn't sign was supposed to be fear of the desire to avenge the Czech oppressors.
If, therefore, the President of the United States were to question the opinion of the Germans in Šumuva, it would be enough to keep a reference in the county of Šumuva to see whether its inhabitants wished to become part of the United States and to live under the United States' cartridges.
Although the text of the letter may seem a little naive in the present knowledge of post-war history, some historians say it represents the expectations of the Sudete Germans at that time.
Even if the Czech Germans had to at least suspect that they were to be evacuated from the country, few of them recognised the possibility.
Some people expected the United States and Britain to agree on a kind of autonomy for the Sudetes.
Again, others had hoped to simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chalupa, an Austrian journalist born in České Budějovice.
Chalupa served in the Baltic Sea as a German in Budějovice during the war.
When the British captured him at the end of the war and put him in a detention camp in Holštynsko, dozens of other Czech Germans came to teach them how to speak Czech.
"They trusted that when they came home, they could use the Czech language," said Chalupa.
In the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one expected to be evacuated from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think - you pay!
The emotional campaign is attacking the leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history is road safety.
It would also characterize the emotional media campaign that the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of the Minister of the State of Aleš, who hopes to scare the leaders away from the dangerous behaviour behind the government.
The $150 million campaign will be on television, radio, cinema, online, but also on flyers.
The leaders should be deterred from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them to fasten their seatbelts before leaving.
He wants to speak primarily to the conscience of young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional leaders.
And what appears in the commercials?
It's a story that attacks emotions, primarily human stories.
That's what the whole campaign's "bloody" slogan says:
You don't think - you pay!
The term "don't think" is written in big letters on the license plate.
And in the pool of blood, there's the word "pay."
It must be a symbol that a man can pay with his life for a moment of negligence.
The viewers are being "scared" by the advertising spoons all the way to 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns from the Anglo-Saxon countries, where drastic images of accident victims can be seen regularly.
It is hoped that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The ads were made by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Pull it, let the drivers
"For drivers, the 'pull, release' system is valid.
For them, 'let' is when they pass the red light, for example, so they save time.
"Pull" is a risk of punishment or accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk, "says Martin Kořán, transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, primarily the negative campaign, the psychologist's opinion.
According to him, the driver's attention to the danger signs is less effective.
"If the danger warning board is fitted, it is likely to quickly merge with the environment and the leaders do not deal with it," warned Kořán.
Olmer would give back almost all the occupied territory in exchange for peace.
Ehud Olmer, President of the Interim Israeli Government, spoke of the return of practically all areas occupied in 1967, i.e. the western Jordan coast, East Jerusalem and the Golan plateau, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He said that in an interview that Jediot Achronot published on Monday.
"We must agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all, if not all (occupied) areas must be returned," said Olmer to the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these areas, but we must give the Palestinians a similar percentage of the Israeli territories, because there will be no peace without it," he added.
He admitted that any return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, wants tractors and bulldozers not to pass through his feet, as happened to one of my best friends, he must give up part of Jerusalem," said Olmer, referring to the attack on two cities in July, in which some people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to the "Temple Hill," which is located in the Old Town, in sacred and historical places.
"Whoever wants to preserve Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This is not going to work, "he emphasized.
Withdrawal from the Golan plateau
Olmer also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from the Golan plateau, which, according to him, is an essential condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I do not recommend peace with Syria solely based on the withdrawal from Golan," he warned me.
"The Syrians know what to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollah (Shiite movement); they must give up regular support to the terrorism of Hamas (Shiite movement), Al-Qaeda and Jihad (holy war) in Iraq, 'said the Prime Minister.
Questions after an accident: Are the flight attendants in the buses illegal?
The law doesn't know them, you can't walk in long-distance buses
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency, the question was raised in the vicinity of the Italian Padova whether passengers and passengers could travel in the bus while travelling.
"If we want to enforce the law strictly and formally, the cabin attendant's activities are in contradiction with the Transport Action Act," says Karel Hanzelka, spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, the death of a 22-year-old flight attendant was probably caused by the driver of the truck crossing the bus road.
Unfortunately for the girl, she was sitting next to the driver at the least safe place on the bus, even though there were two more seats for her.
The bus may crash or suddenly brake at the moment when the flight attendant serves coffee or offers newspapers.
It has a role to play in whether the bus has a standing seat according to the registration.
If the bus is not homogenised, passengers must sit.
The long-distance buses of the Student Agency do not have standing places; confirmed by Aktuálně.cz by Radim Jančura, director of the company.
"We tried to find a solution to this with the Ministry, and at first they refused to allow passengers to move.
However, this was withdrawn and it was concluded that passengers could go to toilet during the journey, if they had their own seats, 'he stated his position.
The law doesn't know the flight attendant.
"There is no clear rule of law on the role of cabin crew member - no legislation regulating this position.
However, no legislation shall prohibit the provision of services to the carrier.
The road traffic law only knows the concept of vehicle driver; its rights and obligations are not defined, 'says Hanzelka, less clearly.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorný, Director of the Road Vehicle Management Department of the Ministry of Transport, considers that the law is dealing with the problem properly.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in its registration.
And it's over, "he says.
Buses may be distinguished by urban areas where there are standing positions and limited maximum speed, as well as city-to-city positions and permitted higher speeds, and distance without standing positions and maximum authorised speed, seats with safety belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP transport security expert, does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of flight attendants on board the bus.
"There is not much danger in the course of continuous progress, and we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
I'm not even sure when there's turbulence and the flight attendant can hit his head. "
"However, if the bus brake suddenly, of course, its laws of physics apply.
Same as in city buses or trams.
The safety of the flight crew must be resolved by the carrier by internal rules, 'he says and also believes that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to terminate services
Student Agency offers flight attendant services as the only bus carrier.
He employs 200 flight attendants.
After the accident, the director doesn't consider their profession risky.
"However, as soon as I get the impression that the duties of flight attendants are risky, I will put an end to it.
Coffee and newspapers can be delivered to passengers when boarding.
That would be cost-saving, "he says.
In its vehicles, the lack of flight attendants was justified by security interests by Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana, who operates a fraction of the flights compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have flight attendants. We've been opposed to that from the very beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some kind of fatal injury, "he said to Týden.cz just a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy.
A young flight attendant from Plzeón, who worked for the company two years ago, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably went out of the stop lane without using a direction indicator and blocked the bus path.
The bus driver tried to avoid it by manoeuvring, but the right front part of the bus hit it.
The fact that two reserved seats for the rest of the flight crew would have been sold would be rejected by Jančura.
"These places can't be seized by long-distance flights, they're blocked."
The company wants to sue the driver of the truck.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency does not wait for a court sentence, but expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
Amendment of the law?
In the distant future
The clarification of the movements of flight attendants on board the bus could be reported by the amendment of the law, which has been working for more than a year by the thirty-person expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
"However, the group did not obtain any concrete results.
The buses are not so much, rather the point system is dealing with the motorway at maximum speed and mobile use while driving, "says Hořín, expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of flight attendants to be something that would pose a fundamental threat to passenger safety," the spokesperson Hanzelka ends by saying that the control of bus safety falls within the remit of the police and labour agencies.
The hopes of Düsseldorf depend on Frankfurt.
The letter from WestLB's board of directors to the bank staff does not lack much in big words.
The merger of the Düsseldorf financial institution and Deka Bank in Frankfurt could result in "the central capital market organisation of the savings bank financial group ', the letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring a permanently profitable "competence block 'into such a business.
Such a relationship could give the decisive impetus to further mergers in the Land banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors trying to prove their ability to act in difficult times.
After all, the precarious WestLB bank is still under enormous pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also from the Federal Financial Services Authority, which recently informed the North Rhine-Westphalia Provincial Government that the deadline for finding a lasting solution is tight.
However, for savings bank customers, the issue between Deka Bank and WestLB, which is famous for its investment funds, has long been a matter of a kind of relationship - including from Frankfurt.
Mr Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, already at the end of August, informed him that the merger of the bank at the Mainzer Landstrasse and a provincial bank such as Helaba or WestLB did not make sense.
However, Deka's board of directors, half of which are representatives of the Landesbanks and half of which are representatives of the savings bank associations, has commissioned the board to negotiate with WestLB on joint business activities.
This may involve the capital market business or certain parts thereof.
However, the negotiations - they say financial circles - have only just begun.
The name of Deka-Bank, among the main employers of the Frankfurt financial sector, does not arise for the first time in relation to the consolidation of the savings bank sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka Bank seemed to be joining the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
But this three-way alliance didn't turn out to be anything.
The plans were barely made public, and the Hessen Provincial Government spoke out against Helaba's interest.
After that, the other two banks did not find each other.
Instead, Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was transferred to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
However, the idea of the relationship between Deka Bank and Landesbanks has been raised again and again.
However, the last time Günther Merl, President of Helaba, spoke against the plans for mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is recognised that there is a need to approach the various banks in the public sector.
Following the regional elections in Bavaria, BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg are expected to be the first.
For Helaba, that's not necessarily good news.
If the pressure for further mergers increases, the potential partners may slowly run out.
In southern Germany, he could only be a younger business partner, even though the financial crisis has so far survived significantly better than the banks in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was excluded at the beginning of the year by Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85% stake in Helaba.
Without a better one, NordLB stays.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side of the coin.
On the other hand, the question arises as to how different business models of individual banks fit together.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings Bank and Fats Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model the future of the Landesbanks should be guaranteed.
Finally, there is still a possibility of cutting up WestLB, which is obviously not what they want there.
Thus, the letter from the board of directors there also states that they are in any event seeking a 'complete solution'.
How this is compatible with the union of individual units with Deca-Bank is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Italian weekend"
It's Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth time.
But now Elena is here as her girlfriend, and so everything is quite different, says the Luca.
Behind them, the five-litre barrel of the Kaiser brand, there is a strong-bodied bearded man, and he is proving to some 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest what deep voices he can draw out of his throat.
Elena's gonna slap Luca's face first, and then she's gonna kiss him.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here, from the bus parking lot near the Puorta Nuova station, four buses will start at 23.45 p.m. "destinazione Monaco, fétta della birra" destination, which is expected to arrive at 6.00 hours.
Three buses are mainly reserved for the Italians, and in the fourth, only Brazilian people travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans were already singing along with their flag, and the celebration began during the night.
"And so loud that it is not for the Italians," says Marco Guarda.
The buses are owned by Marco, wearing a long, artificial fur coat and wide silvery glasses.
He's been taking me to Oktoberfest for five years, but he's been planning three trips this year.
At night there, during the day at Oktoberfest, at 230pm home.
The accommodation would be a waste of time, says Marco.
The road costs EUR 75, including welcome Kaiser beer, accident insurance and German-language guide, cooked in accordance with the Bavarian Brewery Act - a German language course in Marco Frankfurt.
And now the buses are throwing themselves into the night on the highway towards "Brennero."
No beer, not yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will be asleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
A rest is held in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where many Italian buses on highway 8 also take a short break before Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese, as planned, there are nearly 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is holding one last briefing, explaining the plan of war.
First, everybody put on the yellow hat.
On the left, the inscription "Oktoberfest" in fractúr letters can be read and the internet address of Marco's travel agency is "conoscersiviaggiando.it."
Second, "When the beer tent gates open, run," Marco says in the morning.
"Run!" Run and take the seats in the back of the tent.
"Not forward, because we're stuck, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, but spread out in the tent."
The one-litre jar costs 8.25 euros, screaming Marco.
And don't forget the tip.
"Show the security guards that you're behaving well.
As soon as you leave your post, they'll take over! "
Third, "Be here at half past eleven again tonight." Do you understand?
And we're on our way to Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men ties yellow hats to trees, signs, and even to the election poster of one of the great Bavarian peoples.
We must prepare for retreat.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, known as the "Italian weekend."
There are no exact figures; 50,000 people are talking about crossing the Alps in beer tents, 10% of all visitors of the weekend are supposed to arrive from Italy.
The Munich Police Department is reinforced by seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers help the Bajor Red Cross, with about 200 medical supplies in its national statistics, the Italians take the first place, preventing the Austrian (approx. 80) and the British who are at the lowest level of beating (approx. 60).
Among the Italians, the Hofbräu beer tent was particularly popular.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück just last week.
It is fortunate that the word 'relatively' was used by the politician, and he even mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared by crisis-like developments.
Because it happened this weekend.
The property financing company Hypo Real Estate (HRE) in Munich, Daxon, received billions of loans from the German banking consortium to protect itself against market turbulence.
On Monday, a person familiar with the situation informed Reuters that the loan subsidies would amount to EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part used.
The money comes from private banks, part banks.
In the background, the losses of the Depfa subsidiary are behind it.
Depfa, which is a state-funded project, has been reported to lend money to long-term projects and has refinanced itself to a very short maturity - which is now not possible because of the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and the share of its capital decreased moderately from 1,6 to 1,45%.
Current revenues and net revenues from financial transactions fell to zero over the same period of the previous year, from credits to claims and certain securities, and from the liquidation of the provisions of the credit business with a reduction of more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenue generated by the reimbursement of the ex post accounting costs of the ex-Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the tax regulation and the transactions made for the companies belonging to the group, a relatively moderate income deficit of 16% was found.
After privatisation in 1990, the former public funding company had first speculated on corporate real estate loans, which were later segregated at Aeral Bank.
Since there was little money to be made with classical state funding, Depfa has made a stronger contribution to infrastructure projects, as well as joint private investors and state projects (PPP), and has expanded its activities internationally.
For the value of the subsidiaries, Hypo Real Estate must now carry out descriptions which have a "significant impact 'on the group's profit and loss assessment, which have been communicated quite generally.
In fact, no dividends were paid.
The dividend has already been reduced to a third in 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a major State and infrastructure financing company since the adoption of Depfa.
It is more dependent on interbank market refinancing than other financial institutions as it does not have customer deposits.
With the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the bank's lending between banks has stopped because banks are guarding their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets annually to refinance part of Depfa's credit portfolio, some EUR 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group's financing needs are covered for a reasonable period of time, and the company is protected from "the influence of international financial markets which are currently highly inoperable '.
According to other sources, the refinancing is secured by the end of 2009 thanks to the money.
In contrast, Georg Funke, Chairman of HRE, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group does not need to use the financial markets for a reasonable period of time.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Services Authority (BaFin) consider that the market capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secure.
This gives hope to the bank's shareholders and creditors.
But because of the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, they cannot be included.
Even the fact that funding does not need to be fully used is not unthinkable.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late news on Saturday night that the bank was still on the brink of bankruptcy, the temporary rescue for now could not calm the mood.
The share price fell to EUR 3,30 with a 75% reduction.
On the other hand, the bond rates hold pretty well.
While the debt at first place is barely changing, the exchange rates of the subordinated bonds have fallen significantly.
The crisis concerns, in particular, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, as far as possible, the maturity over 2009.
While Hypo Real Estate bonds appeared to have been a speculative investment alternative, their value stability must now be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system as a result of the escalation of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution almost delivered the crisis with the receipt of Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less vulnerable business banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to rely on the repayment of the benefits by the deadline.
Or there will be a situation where almost no one has the courage to hope that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the light of the reports of partial nationalisation, the probability of certainty has now become merely a legitimate hope.
For long-term creditors, it can cause sleepless nights to decide whether to abandon their investment.
However, short-term investors may use the sale to form a reserve for the tax on exchange-rate profits for the years to come.
Sylvana and the secrets of the boarding box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hilton has to introduce herself at Tachibana Highschool on her first day of school, the girls start giggling, the German girl is totally "kavaí"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the manga - in the new exchange student blog, she talks about Japan.
"The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was really nervous.
I was burning up on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo, towards Kavakech, and I take a 40-minute train to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find my own way, and luckily I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching at Tachibana is not taken as seriously as at home in Lower Saxony.
The students start to cramp from 8: 00 until at 8: 40, they have a short conversation with the teacher, "home room."
But before the teaching started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the type to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I've put on an old skirt of my hostess, including a blouse, blue knee stockings and black leather shoes.
So I stood in this dress in front of the catedra, and I tried to say everything right: "Sayonara, vo se Sylvana..." - Sylvana, I'm from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At this moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls were whispering and giggling and waving, and I kept hearing the word "kavaí."
I already knew that from my mangoes.
This belongs to the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls, and it means "cute, sweet."
And then I came to my place quickly.
The girl next to me smiled with a wide smile, and it was an honor to have her sitting next to the exchange student.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the bell rang, they ran off.
Everyone talked and laughed, and with their questions, they drilled a hole in my stomach - and it is quite difficult to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone unpacked their insides.
My host made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from boring German ten o'clock sandwiches.
I got spicy rice, little sausages, salad made of cucumber and algae, fruit and some tofu-wrapped meat.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I'm eating here in Japan.
The food looks strange, and they taste brand-new.
In fact, everything is delicious.
Yeah, well, maybe with the exception of the salt plum, brrrr!
In Japanese schools, indoors are not just lunch.
Sometimes a girl presents a boy with a self-made boarding house, which she makes particularly artistic, hoping to get to know the boy more closely during the lunch break.
I read about this in my manga comic books.
I wonder if I can observe this here.
"Why Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because I'm simply fascinated."
After all, I've been dying to read manga for years.
And to better understand the comics and culture in them, I once started learning Japanese.
It was clear to me, then, that I would have to come here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And these people are very honored here.
Japan is, on the one hand, the country of the latest techniques and trends - and, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have ever seen. "
Rats have feelings, too.
A rat or a moth is on the run in the event of danger.
The neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that animals have feelings.
But how can you examine whether they feel the same way when they behave like us?
The Internet journal "Edge" has been published by famous scientists for years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE is looking at the answers to the question "What do you think is real without being able to prove it?" in one of its series.
I believe that animals have feelings and other state of mind without me or anyone else being able to prove it so far. It is true that we cannot even prove that other people have consciousness.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as we examine other species and investigate the issues of perception or consciousness in general, we arrive in difficult terrain, as hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as many other animals, pretending to be dead, running or attacking.
People behave in a similar way, from which some researchers conclude comparable subjective experiences.
But I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experiences to animals.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related circuits almost always contain the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its role in short-term memory and implementation / management functions).
This wide area is higher in man than in other primates, and it seems to be completely lacking in other organisms.
At least in the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, such as the consciousness of who we are, or, in the case of planning and decision-making ability, it can be reasonably assumed that man is different from other primates.
Another dramatic feature lies in the language nature of man: Since a significant part of human experience is related to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
However, even if it were not dependent on the language, the language would certainly influence it, so animal consciousness, whatever its nature, is probably very different from most of our consciousness states.
It is therefore difficult to determine what consciousness can be like for other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective thing, and because of the special hardware, it cannot be analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then its research presents us with serious problems.
Most of my interpretations relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be more accessible to science.
The consciousness processes of animals, regardless of their content, could be examined, and this is precisely what happens in the case of experiments on short-term memory of primates, especially in the case of visualisation.
However, in this assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the neural connections of consciousness than on the causality mechanisms: both can be the same or not.
Interestingly, this hypothesis also emphasises the importance of prefrontal cortex in the creation of visualisation.
What does that mean about emotions?
I'm leading this back to the fact that an emotional system, like fear, is activated in the brain that is aware of its own activity.
What we call "fear" is therefore the mental state in which we are when the activity of the protection system located in the brain (or its consequences such as physical reactions) occupies a working theory.
Thus, emotions are closely linked to those areas of the cerebral cortex that are characteristic of primates and especially humans.
In addition to language, the perception is divided into subtle stages, because, with the help of words and grammar, we are able to distinguish and categorise conditions so that we describe them to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions are derived from simpler activities in the body perception areas of the cortex and the brain stem, as is Jaak Pankseep, who, however, is more focused on the brain stem.
As this network has not changed very much in human evolution, it can easily play a role in global emotions of species.
In purely hypothetical terms, I can't deny that, but I find it unjustifiable.
Pankseep believes that what seems to be fear in rats and humans in both cases probably feels like how to check whether rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in the same way.
A cockroach on the run in the event of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not yet evidence of the same experience.
Although neural comparisons continue to help, rats and humans have similar brain strains, but cockroaches don't have brains.
But the brain stem is responsible for the emotions?
And even if it could be proven in terms of humans, how can we prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And since their emotions are supposed to be fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I am more interested in the emotional behaviour of rats than in emotional emotions.
In any case, there is progress in this area at the neural level if we measure the same in rats and humans.
Just like in rats, I don't search for language or consciousness, I don't search for emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem like a short-sighted attitude to anyone else, but I'd rather move forward than keep hitting walls.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of the UEFA: Grace time for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunik said that preparations will soon be under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees in its decision in UEFA in Bordeaux confidence in Ukraine and evidence that they believe that Ukraine is capable of organising the European Championship with Poland," said Vasjunik.
"However, this does not mean an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there is still much to do in both countries. "
Both host countries are behind on the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
It is possible that the number of ECJ stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work at top speed, "said Grigorii Surkisz, President of the Ukrainian Football Association.
"The UEFA will keep an eye on us."
In Poland, they took even more radical steps.
Following numerous scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN association, which was replaced by independent Inspector Robert Zawlock.
The Commission met on the initiative of Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is a "serious risk that PZPN is not able to operate according to the rules," said Drzewiecki to the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have provided Michel Platini, President of the UEFA, by letter, that this will not adversely affect the preparations of the 2012 EB."
In the last season alone, several first league teams had to be classified in the lower class because of manipulation, and finally the league class had to be postponed.
The indignant Dennis Quaid is fighting back
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, she was talking about her personal life in the interview, and now she's got a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan Hollywood's star has declared her ex-husband Dennis Quaid a adulterer.
The one who poops - and strikes back
The war of late roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex-married couple: The two Hollywood actors, seven years after their divorce, are fighting a nasty fight against each other in public.
In an interview with the American InStyle journal last week, Meg Ryan made the first statement about the reasons for the divorce: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, causing a lot of pain."
And he didn't know how many women Dennis cheated on until after the divorce.
The spiritual strip was done because of Ryan's new "The Women" movie, which tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to the proclamation of "Horrible," the 54-year-old actor said to the New York Daily News daily newspaper, "that Meg would repeat the story of our relationship and go through it."
In addition, it is "regrettable" that 16-year-old joint sons, Jack, are once again "publicly reminded of all the pain and changes that divorce causes to a child."
While Ryan's been living alone since the divorce, Quaid got married again and recently became the father of a couple of twins.
Therefore, his answer ends with the following page cut: "My life will continue anyway.
I am happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is in great order. "
Air tickets and hotel room prices are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to a current study, flights in Germany have been cheaper by no less than 50%.
The prices of the airways and hotel rooms have again become more favourable - so you can summarize the results of an American Express travel and financial service provider study.
The company analysed the first half of 2008 reservation data and, following the first quarter price increase, found a significant price decrease in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, accommodation has become cheaper in many places.
Between January and March prices increased by an average of 6,9% in 41 of the 48 European cities under investigation compared to 2007.
However, during the period from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37% less than they did a year ago.
The reason for this is that American Express sees it at the low rate of the dollar, which led to "the wanton travel mood of American tourists."
The reduction in hotel room prices affects financial centres such as Frankfurt or London, such as industrial cities such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
The 26,3% increase in hotel prices in the Norwegian city is a European record.
There was also a growing change in the prices of airline tickets in the first quarter.
Due to the increase in kerosene, passengers in the tourist department had to pay an average of 7.1% more than in 2007, while long-term flights with high fuel demand increased by 29.2%.
Between April and June, the prices of tourist grade flights decreased by an average of 12,5% compared to the previous quarter, but business and first class prices only showed a much more moderate change.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March prices increased by 11,9% and decreased by 23,6% in the second quarter.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
On the one hand, the cause of the price decrease lies in the decreasing economic growth, the company claims.
In many segments of the airline market, demand was weakened.
On the other hand, the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe will increase the pressure exerted by the competitive situation.
The tense situation is confirmed by the fact that airlines cancel their lost flights and a number of airlines have failed in the first half of 2008 - only in Europe it affects 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach to 1: 0.
One goal and simple methods led by Hamburger SV.
At the Borussia, Luhukay still has no way of finding a working team.
Kristoffer Klein enlarge Deep flight for National Team Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player was only late in the game, and his raise came back from the gate tree.
The exact message you wrote left your lips convincing.
He just knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," said Hermann Rieger, in the corridor to the cabins of the arena in Hamburg.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them were back in place.
Rieger has been a physical therapist of HSV for nearly three decades, and he has more authority than a few former players.
Thus, his request was heard at the appropriate place.
The assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded, and presented his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of the head coach in Hamburg, Martin Jol.
His orders must have been similar, give me the second goal!
The order has not been executed.
"Today was not always a beautiful sight," said Marcell Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhardt, too, imagined it more loosely.
The 1: 0 (1: 0) goal result is due to the head of the hamburgers Mladen Petric (11); and the fact that very weak Gladbachians have not been able to cause pain to weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty victory," said Martin Jol.
Hamburger SV is going to be 121 on Monday.
The viewers celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table on the screen, which presented their team as the champion of the tournament.
It's a birthday without a party.
"We know where to put it," said Marcell Jansen.
It indicates that the Tablella intermediate certificate indicates the unpredictability of the league rather than the dominance of HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly, but not yet brilliant, thanks to its late-committed compositions - the Brazilian Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petrick and Jansen acquired from FC Bayern.
"We need more sense and deceit," said Jol.
After the withdrawal,
Wall Street is full of fear.
The first news of the crash of the rescue package led Dow Jones to a temporary drop of 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of score in his history in one day.
Later, the Dow became somewhat stronger.
At 20: 30, the world's most important barometer was 5 percent in Minus, and it stood at 10.579 points.
The technology paper dealer Nasdaq fell by more than seven percent to 1548 points.
Dow's biggest loser at the moment was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America by 12 percent.
No paper has been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs Bank's stock went down nearly 10%.
Only a few days earlier, Warren Buffett bought a share in the bank as a major investor.
The rescue mission is intended to provide funds for the purchase of so-called dubious mortgage certificates.
However, the amount is to be paid not at the same time but gradually.
In return, the State would receive shares options from financial institutions, which would be useful in the event of an appropriate development of exchange rates, reducing the burden on the State Treasury.
European and American and stock exchange rates in the drop-off
Billionaire aid for European and American banks does not dispel investors' doubts.
The stock price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate is falling and it's taking Dax.
The American Dow Jones indicator is failing despite the planned rescue of the money market by the state.
The spectacular exchange losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have driven the German share ratio (Dax) deep into the minus.
Despite the rescue operations of the Federal Government and private banks, the value of the real estate investor in Munich fell to a quarter, and the value of the commercial investor in München fell by over 20 percent.
The Dax has fallen below the spiritual limit of 6000 points, and has subscribed to 5839 points by 3.7 percent.
The stock markets are on their knees all over the world.
In New York, Wall Street has made significant losses.
The investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost the financial markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, which means it went down by 3.3 percent to 10.809.25.
The US House wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote could take place on 1 October.
The rest of the European stock exchanges have only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed 3.2 percent weakness, CAC lost 2.9% in Paris.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index was reduced by 1,26% to 11.743,61 after the initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Sound Seng index went back 2.1 percent to 18.286.90 points.
The Indian Sensex index lost 506,43 points, i.e. 3.9 percent, and closed at 12.595,75 points.
The shares of Arcandor on the Mdax stock exchange were weakened after the capital increase was announced.
The private bank of Sal Oppenheimer has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourism group also stated that Thomas Cook shares were not sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among researchers for years. Dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
The experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew into outer space for nearly 18 years.
The soon-to-freeze fuel lines are threatening to freeze to death.
For years, scientists have been confused by a mysterious phenomenon called swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is the gravitational swing maneuver of space probes, in which they generate additional momentum in the gravity field of the Earth, for example.
That way, the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe, like the Ulysses solar probe, also used this physical trick.
However, what amazes researchers for years is that flying objects do not behave fully as would be expected under the ancient Gravity Act.
Instead, abnormalities occur at speed.
The probes are suddenly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was named swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct, which takes the mass pull of matter as a curvature of space.
The American physicist Stephen Adler, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and that swing-by anomaly is trying to explain the so-called dark material discovered by astronauts in the universe.
"The anomaly may be responsible for dark matter, which may be found near Earth," says Adler.
The existence of dark matter was discovered by space researchers only ten years ago.
Obviously, it exposes a gravitational force which can be seen as having an effect on other celestial bodies.
However, the material itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not emit or reverse any electromagnetic radiation, especially visible light.
Scientists estimate that a good one-fifth of the total mass of the universe consists of dark matter.
The tourists who were abducted in Egypt were freed.
After ten days in the captivity of their abductors, the tourists carried away in Egypt are once again free, confirmed by the Italian Foreign Minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting prior to the release of the hostages, six hostages are believed to have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five German citizens were abducted.
The ransom negotiations are ongoing.
Again and again, Germans become targets for the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE reports the most important cases.
European tourists carried away in Sahara are free.
This was also reported by Egyptian state television, Al-Arabija Arab TV and Italian media.
According to Italian Sky TG 24 television stations, Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: "Our fellow countrymen and other hostages have been freed.
We are currently examining their health, "said Frattini.
The five German, five Italian, and one Romanian citizen and eight Egyptian escorts are safe and sound, reported by Egyptian state television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reason for the shooting before the release of the hostages is still vague: an Egyptian security official said that the hostages were already willing to release the hostages when the Sudanese army surprised them to kill them.
"The problem is solved.
The ransom was accepted, "said the official.
"It was only about taking the hostages," when suddenly the surprise occurred.
Sudan soldiers shot six kidnappers on Sunday in the border between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two were arrested.
The hostages demanded a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been transferred to the German wife of one of the hostages.
The "al-Masri al-Jom" newspaper, referring to a German mediator, reported that the release of the hostages is delayed because the kidnappers are worried about their own safety.
According to the report, the hostage takers release the female hostages after the ransom is paid.
The men are being held by the kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
"led to suicide" by stepfather violence
In court, it was said that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather raped her for years.
The 57-year-old Michael Trerise in the town of Stithians of Cornwall County spent six years in prison after confessing to eight counts of attempted rape.
The Truro Criminal Court has come to know that you regularly tied up your stepdaughter, Stephanie Randle, between the ages of five and seven.
In one of her statements, she wrote, "I feel responsible for her death."
At the trial, it was said that Randle committed suicide in his home in the Mutley district of Plymouth at 34 years old, on 1 April 2007.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise tied her eyes and blindfolded her before intercourse while her mother worked in a beer shop.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and reelected Cornwall as his home.
She moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it was found that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Monument Protection Organization, was being persecuted by the horror of the violence repeated twice a week.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who used to be passionate about surfing and cycling, said her friends were "emotional dead" and "gave up on life."
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle got into a fight with his daughter's stepfather, who ended his statement in a letter saying, "I've always tied him up and blindfolded him.
I didn't sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death. "
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetista, and I'm sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim committing suicide.
However, the fact that, if he had not done so, the case might never have been brought to justice. "
The judge added: "I would like to draw attention to the impact Stephanie's parents have on your daughter of the crime you committed over the years.
If that hadn't happened, she would have probably been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman. "
The official who lost important data has been indicted.
The BBC has informed us that there is a violation of official secrecy against a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June.
The man was on a mission from the Department of Defense when he left two top-secret documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is the least of the charges for breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of a deliberate crime.
Frank Gardner, reporting to the BBC Department of Defense, said the move surprised a lot of people at Whitehall.
"They thought the Ministry of Defense and the government would handle the case as an internal matter," he said.
The employee who cannot be named has been charged under Section 8.1 of the law.
The state's attorney's office has suggested that the indictment against the official should be represented by Metropolitan Police on behalf of the man for his rather sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost also included secret surveys on Al-Qaeda and Iraqi military capabilities.
He was informed of the decision on Monday and moved from his home to a place unknown.
The housing cooperatives pay B & amp; B account
Great Britain's housing cooperatives can count on an account of more than £80 million in English after the rescue of Bradford & amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent £14 billion on 2.6 million account holders to protect its deposits with Bradford & amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use the deposit holders' money, including 59 housing associations.
The president of the Association of Housing Construction Cooperatives (BSA), Adrian Coles, says that it is "annoying 'that companies and their members must pay.
The EUR 14 billion loan will eventually be repaid after the return of Bradford & amp; Bingley's mortgages.
However, the interest accrued in the meantime will be charged annually to 700 financial companies which use the loans.
The Financial Services Compensation System has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations are one of them.
It is frustrating that the institutions that have been acting with caution have now to pay the accounts of those institutions that have been much less cautious.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We've learned that every company has to pay as much as it has in its possession, that companies share 18% of the cost.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach GBP 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to save £81 million to pay the first year's interest.
Adrian Coles, head of the housing companies union, told the BBC that you consider the measure unfair.
"It is outrageous that institutions that have to pay the accounts of the less cautious institutions which have acted carefully at the time of the recovery of the housing market '.
According to BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
"We must examine this matter in every way over the next few weeks in order to decide how to protect housing companies and their members from a significant amount of accounts," Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers 7 months from the end of September to the end of March of this year.
In 2010, a total annual interest rate will be paid, which may be twice as high as the one we are currently seeing.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, they will eventually have to pay the bill, either through higher fees or through lower interest rates received for their deposits.
The price of milk rises by five pence per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey dairy company announced that it would increase the wholesale price of milk by five pence per litre from Monday.
This year, this is the second increase in prices since the two pennies increase in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
The resellers decide whether or not to pass on the price increase to consumers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of Jersey milk changed last in 2002.
The request of a former Member of the Parliament of Bangladesh to be released was rejected.
The Bangladesh court has rejected the request for the release of a former Member of Parliament, Sheikh Hasina, which means that he may be arrested when he returns to the country.
His lawyer said that the court refused to defend himself freely on the charge that he deported 50 million pouches ($729.700) from a businessman during his parliamentary term.
This case is just one of the countless corruption charges against him.
Sheikh Hasina's old political opponent, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail this month.
Sheikh Hasina has to return to Bangladesh for the next few weeks, but her party, Awami League, demands that the country's military-sponsored temporary government give her full freedom first.
According to the reports, although he was paroled to go abroad for treatment, the conditions of release do not clearly indicate whether he can retain his freedom when he returns to the country.
His lawyers say that he will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the appellate court.
"The court of appeal dismissed Sheikh Hasina's request for bail by saying that it was not necessary, since he was already on temporary leave and was in treatment abroad," we learned from Attorney Huq in Rafique.
"We will appeal against the decision of the court of appeal."
His lawyers argue that the reason he needs to be able to defend himself in the open is so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League party told us on Sunday that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17th.
He was arrested last year after the military-sponsored temporary government took over, but he was released from prison in June to go abroad for treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny any charges brought against them.
Concerns about the polio vaccination programme in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, almost 200 000 children in Afghanistan were left out of the recently organized polio vaccination programme because of the violence against the Taliban.
Last week, the UN organized a vaccination mission in six provinces.
However, they said they couldn't get to the children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
According to a UN spokesperson, all this happened despite the promises made by the Taliban: they will not attack or interfere with the work of thousands of personnel who have carried out the vaccination.
BSkyB's appeal to ITV has been denied.
BskyB's appeal against the decision of the Committee on Competition, which ordered it to reduce its interest in the rival TV station, ITV.
The Competition Appellate Court ordered BSkyB to reduce its share of ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
In the past, the Commission noted that BSkyB's share is hindering competition and giving the company unfair influence over ITV.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 and thus effectively prevented NTL, which has since been renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Office reported that BSkyB's shareholding in ITV threatened ITV's independence, encouraging the Competition Committee to launch an investigation.
The Director of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Oversight Offcom all opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its ITV share was a pointless and disproportionate reparation - in particular, that BSkyB declared that it would be willing to give up its voting rights.
Another investigation into the U.S. Attorney General's case
The US Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the discharge of the nine U.S. State's Attorney in 2006.
The move followed the criticism of the decisions of government officials by the Chief Inspector of the judicial wallet on the matter.
The report criticised White House officials, legislators and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was ordered because it was feared that the state's prosecutors had been dismissed for political reasons.
Nora Dannehy, a special prosecutor, will now investigate whether the officials who have been heard during the investigation have tried to lie to prevent justice.
"Serious charges relating to possible crimes have not yet been investigated and have not been cleared," said Glenn Fine, Superintendent.
One of his main suggestions was to appoint a special prosecutor who has the power to make witnesses testify.
The series began with the removal of nine state prosecutors from the US judicial wallet in December 2006.
At the time, they said the state's prosecutors were fired because of their poor performance.
However, it was later found that the dismissed state prosecutors received no worse evaluations than many of their other colleagues, which led many to the conclusion that political consideration had taken place behind the redundancies.
Some state prosecutors were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican congressmen, while others refused to take part in the investigation of allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
The U.S. Attorney General is conducting an investigation and prosecuting court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be released at any time, but they cannot be removed from their positions for political reasons.
At that time, the head of the judicial wallet, the Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, became the target of attacks because of discharge, and finally resigned.
Many other officials of the judicial wallet have also resigned.
In his report, the Chief Inspector criticised the role of Gonzales in the case, according to which the Attorney General was "primary responsibility" for redundancies, "renounced his" managing role "and" leakily withdrawn "from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant to Bush, criticise that they have not cooperated in the investigation.
Meat Loaf Eposa gets recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf is going to be honored at the Q Awards Awards for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer who will be taking over his special gold-grade prize next week at the London Festival said that he would be honored to be recognized.
The nine minutes, fifty-five seconds long song was the theme song of Meat Loaf's 1977 audience success album.
Coldplay got the most nominations for this year's awards, and they were put on the candidate list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that cross the boundaries of time or genres, and" Bat Out Of Of Hell "is like this."
The song that Jim Steinman got required a very big voice, and that voice was Meat Loaf's.
The song began with an almost two-minute instrument section.
It was released as a single in 1979, and on the hit lists it reached the 15th place.
However, Meat Loaf's album "Bat Out Of Hell" has been on the hit lists for almost nine years and has then sold over 40 million copies.
Meat Loaf, actually known as Marvin Lee Aday, has recently had medical problems, including surgery due to heart arrhythmia in 2003 after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, due to acute laryngitis, he had to cancel some concerts.
Later, it turned out there was cyst on his vocal cortex.
Unknown metropolitan street that is often forgotten and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of radiations, tours and other side roads, some of which are famous, others performing purely practical functions.
However, a lot of experienced taxi drivers and long-lived local residents can hardly tell us where Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The small street is in East Village, heading north from First Street - without reaching Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
It's about 9 m wide and 36 m long, and it's more like a dusty alley than a major road.
There are no street signs.
Technically, you can't find it on a standard map.
However, the street has admirers.
There it is, for example, Avalon Bay, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to rebuild the Extra Place and make sure that the new buildings have a cleaner way of getting to the shops and boutiques.
The admirers of the street include the long-lived neighbors who were caught in the brittle street by the fact that it was the only remnant of the neighborhood's past before renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the building maintenance and development department of the city, has no interest in insisting on it.
This month, at a meeting of the district council planning committee, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the committee would prefer the street to remain in the city's care and asked for a new plan next month, Susan Stetzer, Head of Local Government 3 District.
"There are very few areas in the city now, and we would like the Extra Place to remain in the city," he said.
"Proposals for renewal and treatment may be made by Avalon, but we would also like to guarantee that it remains available to the public."
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that it wanted to rebuild the small street and provide seats, some of which would be used by a café, to which the builder is expected to rent an area.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public during this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, spokesman for the Avalon Bay, said that although the company would like to use the street, it does not insist on owning it.
"The main point of Avalon Bay is to renovate this demolished alley and turn it into a pleasant public place," he said, adding that the city recommended its purchase.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Building Conservation Office, said that the city really wanted to sell the street and noted that the office was responsible for building development and not for handling it.
Compared to your colder neighbor Bowery, Extra Place is not of much historical significance.
Some say he was named "no-man's land" in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his countless children, and no one claimed the narrow land.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the backdoor of CBGB, opened to Extra Place, and the street is perhaps the most interesting thing about the photograph on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
"It was a great location," said Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, clothes, barrel and poster pieces, and leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they owned the East Village in the middle class, are opposed to selling Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, however modest, must remain in the community's possession.
Others refer to Extra Place as a rare thing, which is a virtually unchanged piece of the city and which must be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, author of the blog "The Missing New York of Jeremiah" ("Book of Sears: bitter nostalgia of the process of extinction of the city") posted a part of the history of Extra Place in 1952, which was published in the column entitled "The New Yorker" on "Urban Rumors."
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, small dead-end, dark, even during the day, limited by rusty iron storage doors and shuttlecraft windows, where the wind carries a week's worth of newspapers in the tunnels."
The street, apart from a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran across the street, next to the back door that used to lead to CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher-priced clothing store in its place.
There was graffiti on the walls, and there was an empty 0.75 litre beer bottle lying next to a drop of fresh paper.
Some bystanders told me that they rarely think about Extra Place, but they think they could use the renovation.
Fields told me that he thinks some people underestimate his attractiveness in the state of the street.
"I spent the best years of my life in dark, damp and disgusting places," he said.
Debate on bilingual education: Continuous exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Monitor Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates' views on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, who is an experienced researcher in California studies at the Pacific Institute for Public Policy Research and senior director of education research, co-author of the book "Not as good as you think: Why does the middle class need school choice?"
It is not easy to please voters from Spanish-speaking areas.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are also included.
Obama's campaign says "African-American and Spanish-speaking students are considerably less likely to graduate than white students," and that's true.
In order to overcome such differences in performance, Obama's educational plan explicitly supports, among other things, "temporary bilingual education" for those studying in English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which focuses on school education in non-English, outweighs his interest in overcoming large differences in performance.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep contract elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
Most of the school students are Spanish-speaking and low-income.
More than one third of the students - many of whom have recently arrived - are learning English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results in the 2008 state mathematics test.
Similarly, it is impressive that 93% of the fourth-grade students have passed the English language and literature exam.
This incredible achievement was not achieved by the means Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street focuses on repetition, practice, continuous evaluation of skills and rejection of objections.
Besides, this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikels, Director of Sixth Street, the school's educational principle is the "full immersion" of English students in the language environment.
The essence of the immersion method is the almost exclusive use of English in teaching other subjects.
Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, said: "We have had an overwhelming success in the fact that if someone walked into a classroom, they would not notice who a student had arrived from Mexico 12 months before."
"It works," he said, "it works for us."
Would Obama set schools such as Sixth Street Prep as an example of other schools with a significant number of Spanish lips and students in English?
The results achieved by the school should make the answer clear, but because of the education policy of its own party (National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education), and since it is itself consistent with bilingual education, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants need to learn English, Obama has recently made a dishonourable statement on the issue when he said that people should not be so concerned about the "exclusively English nature" of legislation.
Instead, he said, "they should make their children speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to reduce the differences between results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking down and ignoring them.
The price of oil fell sharply due to renewed economic concerns.
On Monday, oil prices fell sharply due to concerns that America's rescue plan for financial markets will not be able to revive the economy.
The stock of crude oil dropped by seven percent to $99.80 in the morning at the New York Stock Exchange.
Prices have decreased by over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, the commodity exchanges have been shaken by Wall Street financial turmoil and some powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the prices reached USD 145.29 per barrel in July, they fell back to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before being again affected by the immeasurable uncertainty of the financial markets.
On Monday, the concern repossessed investors even after the Congress leaders announced that they had managed to agree on the economic rescue that was the greatest in history this weekend.
The news has been under a shadow of concerns that the financial crisis will not be over for a long time.
As the latest event of the emerging crisis, Citigroup will buy up Wachovia Corporation's banking business, announced on Monday by the government.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
According to Barclays Capital's analysts, "as a result of desperate weekend talks, it seems that the rescue operation failed to revive the market trading mood."
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also decrease.
"The future of the market in ordinary shares, interest rates and exchange rates has become uncertain worldwide," wrote Deutsche Bank, an analyst to investors.
"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by an epidemic."
From the point of view of the commodity exchange, the biggest question is to what extent the "disease" of the United States infects the whole world, especially China. "
As oil consumption decreased as a result of economic growth, the banks' analysts cut down their expectations for next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With the second quarter bravado, the team has set its record
After spending more time in the Jets' jersey than anyone in the last eight seasons, Shaun Ellis, playing in a defensive end position, thought he'd seen everything.
But then he watched the second quarter unfold on Sunday when the Jets turned a game without a point into a sensational match.
"I've never seen anything like it," said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals played in full harmony with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, quarterback, gave Laveranas Coles a 12-yard touchdown pass, which became the perfect precursor to an afternoon in which their cooperation developed significantly.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passes in this quarter, including when two Cornerbacks fell in a row ten seconds before the end of the half-hour.
"I wasn't sorry for the trouble," said Favre, "about all his passes to Coles.
"Hell of a player.
We've been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think. "
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped the Cardinals quarterback, Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis in the corner back position caught a bad shot and threw it back 32 yards, which was touchdown.
Eric Smith, safe player, reached into another pass and got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to knock the ball out of Warner's hand.
This last turn could have been the most amazing move in the game.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely scored a 20-yard field goal, setting the 34: 0 score.
That was the best result the Jets have ever achieved in a quarter of a century.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to describe the mind-blowing character of the game, he said, "The second or third quarter?"
When he was told that both - in the third quarter, the Cardinals scored 21 points without the Jets getting any - Mangini said: "I must say that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third quarter.
We scored a lot of points in a short time. "
The rested Gebrselassie will break his own world record
The Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many consider it the best mid- and long-distance runner ever lived when he broke his world record in Berlin on Sunday. He became the first to run the 42.2 km in 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a convenient flat track victory in 2: 03: 59, Gebrselassie improved 27 seconds on his previous score of 2: 04: 26 in Berlin last year.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie had set a world record of 26th in so many areas that from 1500 metres to the marathon, he had won a world championship in almost every future or reached a world record.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Beijing - which, in retrospect, may have proved to be excessive caution - that air pollution would further worsen his asthma problems.
Instead, he entered the Berlin marathon.
Under almost perfect conditions - in sunny weather, initially at 9 ° C and at 13 ° C at the end - Gebrselassie won on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at 56 seconds per kilometre.
Since the runners who had not started the marathon before, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Tergat of Kenya had turned to longer distances, the marathon record has fallen more than two minutes in the last decade since the Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin with 2: 06: 05 in 1998.
After the victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago, his legs crammed and couldn't train for two weeks.
Obviously, it was freshened up during the emergency rest and not rusty.
"I am so happy," said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
"Everything worked out perfectly.
I started training again a week ago, and today I had my doubts, but in the end, everything was fine. "
He has received some criticism, especially from Kenya, the Eastern African rival of Ethiopia, that he uses too many aids during his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathon runners, relying on his riders as if he were running on a track and putting world records before the spirit of competition.
However, this criticism hardly reduces the grandeur of Gebrselassie in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the seminal point at 1: 02: 04 with four Kenyan road runners on Sunday.
Two cutting-edge Kenyan runners, James Kwamba and Charles Kamachi, gave Gebrselassie the beat after the riders were tired.
Shortly more than 4.8 km before the finish, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with a last sprint, who was the second target at 2: 05: 36, 5 minutes to improve his individual best.
Kamathi came in third in 2: 07: 48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, who is now a German citizen, closed a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2: 19: 19.
The world summit is held by the British Paula Radcliffe at 2: 15: 25.
In the past spring, the 36-year-old Mikitenko won a surprise on the London marathon with 2: 24: 14.
He was unable to attend because of the alleged back injury at the Beijing Olympics, but he recovered quickly and won the Berlin marathon, where he improved his personal peak by five minutes.
He won the race with a smart calculation: first, he allowed a group of Ethiopians and Kenyans to advance and gain significant leadership, and then, after about 30 km, he followed them.
The Ethiopian Askale Tafa Magarsa reached the finish line in the second time at 2: 21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became third with a result of 2: 25: 01.
A separate city, the pride and the ordeal of black people
In the experience park in Greater Orlando, a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and powerful, there is a quiet little town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience were born.
Eatonville, the first pure black city that was integrated into the country and which was Zora Neale Hurston's childhood home, is no longer as simple as he described in 1935: "the five lakes, three croquet tracks, 300 brown leather, 300 good swimmers, lots of guava and two schools without prison."
It's a pilgrimage now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee attended the annual Zora Festival in honor of the most famous female writer of Harlem Renaissance, Hurston.
Yet, in many ways, the city described and made a tourist attraction, which is also in the Florida travel book of the Federal Writers' Project of the Crisis Age, is distinct from its surroundings.
It's just as independent, dignified and shut-down as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that the black people in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white people who "know so little about us that they don't know what they're missing."
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate, Barack Obama, encourages open discussion on the racial issue, many of us here are distrust of outsiders' glances.
"We care very much about how to tell our story," said the 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and was a member of the oldest church in the city.
"You have to say it correctly."
Eatonville has long been characterised by a paradox of victory and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historic model of the black show, but it is a community of almost 2400 people, where poverty indicators can double the national average.
Partly a literary node, and partly an example of a culture of American slavery, sometimes looked down, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black, which flourishes in the shade of oak trees.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the residents here are both proud and defensive.
The picture of Eatonville has been important since Zora (everyone here calls Hurston).
In the books written in the honest, strong dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes were Watching God" (1937), he introduced his hometown to the world.
The five paragraphs of the Florida guidebook have transformed the city, which lies next to Route 17. This road leads from the long forgotten headquarters of Florida to one of the sites of black history and human drama.
Hurston, who was both brave in life and in literature, like the drum roll, introduced his readers into the business of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then looked into the more intimate spheres.
He wrote: "To the right of the road we can find modern public school with a brown edge, with carefully organized yards and playgrounds, which Howard Miller provides, although he can barely read and write."
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, and he wrote that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that might be needed in temporary accommodation."
So in a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but also illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
Clearly, the Fodor's guidebook presented it differently.
This description really didn't suit everyone.
"Zora said things the way they were," said the 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls. Hurston made them immortal by quoting the deaf songs that men sang about their beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as the living freak who used to visit home after his family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin recalled that when Hurston stormed into the city, he usually arrived unannounced in a beating Chevrolet, smoking cigarettes, and in long trousers in a city where even today people are proud of their dignified attire.
Most people were enchanted, said Franklin, but a lot of people were.
"People were always happy to see Zora," said Franklin.
However, on the terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added, swinging in his chair, "He never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that along with most of the world, Eatonville had forgotten about it.
Although he was once a popular writer, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, he was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where he used to live.
There were no significant commemorations in Eatonville or large public readings.
"I don't think they understand how much he has enriched the world or what he has left us at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of the book "The Hurston biography," published in 2003, wrapped in the Rainbow. "
The turning point came in 1980.
Officials of Orange County wanted to build a five-lane road across town instead of two-lane main street, Kennedy Avenue, which played an important role in the life of the community.
The expanding Orlando has already penetrated the interstate 4 interstate interstate on the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of history.
Among other things, forced integration has put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle of racial mixing tasted hatred with the community.
"Then a bunch of white boys came over and threw oranges and other things at the side of the road," said Franklin.
"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a watermelon out of a car. "
In a letter to the "The Orlando Sentinel" in 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court to impose violent integration, thus making a statement on the decision "Brown v. Board of Education": "it is more offensive than respecting my species."
Today, residents say that although the desegregation of schools was positive in some respects, it weakened the cohesion of the Eatonville people and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children are used to hugging them - I remember this - the man hugged his teacher in the morning and evening," said N. Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, managing director of the non-profit organization "Let's keep the Commonwealth of Eatonville."
"This took as long as the students and teachers came from the same place," he added.
"We didn't hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher," I mean, there were cultural differences between us, "said Nathiri.
However, human rights have helped many other Zora Neale Hurston ascend - in black writers, actors and artists who have surpassed prejudice, as she has done, with such optimistic self-confidence and lines as: "How can anyone deprive themselves of the pleasure of my company?
This is incomprehensible to me. "
In 1975, Alice Walker made a pilgrimage to Hurston's unmarked grave, and she began to fight to restore her reputation.
Five years later, the bookstores were placed on the shelves of a recognised Hurston biography written by Robert E. Hemenway, which once again brought him back to America's role models.
The road construction project would have started just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again at the centre of attention.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw him as a savior.
In 1988, the community organized a Hurston festival to show what the county would destroy with its main route.
Thousands of fans arrived at the opening event two years later, and since then many have returned to the ceremony every January.
A few years later, the county stopped proposing road construction.
"Because of the five lanternating of the main road, the community reanimated, fully moved to full speed, which means a real civic pride," said Nathiri.
Boyd said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road construction project helped change the city's image of itself.
There was an increasing number of people outside the city, such as Attorney Rachelle Munson, who started coming to church in 1993, and the locals began to reassess the past.
Eatonville was added to the national historical list in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-storey library (of course named after Hurston) was opened, on the refurbished and beautiful Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville still has Florida's cuckoo egg: it's not exactly 10 km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban side street during the summer rain; it's as small as when 27 black families founded it in the 1880s.
(90% of residents are black today.)
The outsiders who come here looking for Eatonville's story and what he has to say are still being taken with caution.
Most interviews require prior authorisation, and some things - such as the oldest fresco in Eatonville, which is painted by a white man and depicts black people working in the fields - should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including the confident Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to bright red, are afraid that their separate community is misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown grew in growth.
In particular, young people increasingly regard Eatonville as Hurston saw his own race: it is not better, it is worse, it is just as proud, it is creative, it is hard, it is foolish and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
There is a genuine civil connection from the words of Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return after graduating from college to work at the local government or the police, which he believes needs help.
And it seems the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twins Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
"Most people who just come through here think this town is nothing compared to others," said Alondra Kenon, recently after the service on Sunday.
"But if someone stops and takes some time to learn his history, it's a very nice city."
We all talk about finance in New York.
Nothing's changed on the surface.
If tourists didn't care about the newsstand and the giant television projectors in Times Square, they wouldn't know they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never realize that with glass-walled, beehive-shaped offices above their heads, bankers and venture fund managers, who have held New York in their power, have been living the hardest days since 1929.
The couriers still rattle their metal teas through the pavement, carrying trays loaded with muffins for morning meetings.
There are still men with Spanish lips crawling between the blocks, carrying as human mules fifty-odd ironed shirts hanging over their shoulders, resembling a yoke.
Office workers are still lining up for their breakfast sweet pastries at the food trucks on the sidewalk, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4: 00 and 7: 00 on a weekday.
I didn't feel there was any crisis until I decided to open a new bank account on Thursday afternoon, despite all the bad news.
Although I was planning on taking care of it in the local account of JP Morgan Chase during the afternoon's calm, I had 20 people standing in line.
Not at the bank cashier's window, where money can be collected or paid, but at the customer service counter, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to Macy's store, and where new customers open bank accounts.
Many before me - I learned later from Starr, the banker assigned to me - stood in line with the same intention as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already taken money from small banks in their homes, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was taken out of the so-called savings banks (such as housing cooperatives), loan cooperatives and small-town savings banks that only operate in one state and allegedly treat their clients as family members.
In the last year, 15 of these banks have gone down quietly.
In the last few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion capital, has been in bankruptcy custody, and when the New Yorkers left for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a bank rescue buyer with a savings of $440 billion.
The staff of the office and shop before me, in fear of another collapse, transferred their money to a bank that seemed to be a safe haven, to a bank that does most of the capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have become experts in finance over the last few weeks.
A woman at the local Chinese store spoke on her phone about the bankrupt Lehman Brothers bank and her huge-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, as if she were complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the caretaker of my apartment block in uniform and in his 50s, changed the subject, and now we're not talking about Brad and Angelina or my food delivery, as usual.
He said to me after I went to the bank, "I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not taking any chances. "
Muslim tombs were desecrated while Austria was tipping to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, right-wing Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, the Belgian right-wing party, Vlaams Belang, participated in a demonstration in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, at which the "City of Islam Conquest" organization presented itself.
They went up with signs imitating traffic signs that depicted mosques crossed through the red line.
According to the police, extreme right-wing extremists are responsible for the desecration of Muslim cemeteries in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when the far-right parties made significant progress in national parliamentary elections.
There were over 90 grave injuries in the trauma cemetery next to Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as the star David, on some graves, but according to the detectives, they were only trying to hide their extreme motives from hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is somehow related to the elections.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that they were "deeply shaken" at the sound of the cry, which occurred shortly before the end of the Muslim religious month, the Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria is conducting a conscience review following yesterday's parliamentary elections, during which the political balance has been tilted to the right.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which gained almost 30% of the votes, were campaigned for the future of the Freedom Party and the Alliance of Austria, for a strong anti-immigration law, and some of their slogans were branded xenophobic by their critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, President of the Freedom Party, who received more than 18% of the votes, also expressed disapproval of food allegedly linked to Islam.
At the final meeting of the Party in Vienna, he spoke of a 'European brotherhood' which prevents the strengthening of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols for the ongoing Islawash of Austria and Europe.
According to the polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections that led to a far better victory, the change was due to a largely young voting base who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter has been banned from a foreign journey.
Garry Glitter, a known rock star convicted of rape of children, was banned from his trip to France and Spain by the court.
The judges decided to ban Glitter for six months after notifying the authorities who controlled him of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The police in Kent obtained the ban on travel on Thursday after submitting evidence of the cases of sexual violence against children against Glitter to the court.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, was not involved in the Ashford Magistrates trial in Kent, but represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A court spokesperson said: "On Thursday, 25 September, the Kent Police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court to prevent Paul Gadd from travelling to France and Spain on 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't show up in person."
The 64-year-old Glitter notified the authorities of its intention to travel abroad because it was bound by the law applicable to the sex offender register.
You must inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
You also have to notify the police at least seven days before the scheduled departure.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of up to five years.
The police in Kent told me that they do not want to talk about individual cases in Glitter County and their possible whereabouts.
We have learned from the spokesperson of the Kent Police Department: "The Kent Police are doing everything in their power to protect children within the country and abroad.
"In our opinion, it is easier to check someone if they do not leave the United Kingdom, because here we have a comprehensive system to deal with potential risks more effectively.
"The most important task of the Kent Police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continuously monitor the behaviour of the persons in the sex offender's records and who live in the county to minimise potential risks to the population."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnam prison for the rape of a 10-year-old and 11-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he was supposed to transfer to a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he was feeling unwell and refused to fly to London.
The local authorities refused to allow him to pass the passport inspection, so he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to enter the country, so they flew back to Bangkok, where local police and immigration officials insisted on returning to Britain.
Finally, it arrived at the Heathrow airport Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there until his lawyer, David Corker, went to the Uxbridge Court in West London, as Scotland Yard, as requested, was entered in the register of sex offenders under a court order.
Glitter had previously spent four months in prison in the United Kingdom for possession of photographs of child rape in 1999.
According to a source in the Ministry of Interior, Secretary of State for Home Affairs Jacqui Smith welcomed with comfort and joy that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
"I don't take pictures on stage because I want to personally introduce the artist" Gunther Bauer Photographer
No sets, no haircuts, no dancing shoes.
The master of the flamenco from close to the body, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the ordinary faces of the dancers.
The artist, on the one hand.
On the other hand, the ordinary man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in the intimate moments distant from the audience, when we can take a personal move, grab the depth of a captured look, or wonder at the beauty of the idle but expressive hand of the artist who is not about to perform the stage.
In the German series Günther Bauer Flamenco-people, the tea rallability of singers, dancers and guitarists is combined with this less known everyday side of masters.
Through the photos, the flamenco's specific iconography is presented from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of the Month of Flamenco Photography, "reflects the growing international importance of flamenco from day to day," says the creator, adding that the Flamenco-people character could be anyone, as the observer, seeing the images, finds that these images are not typical depictions of artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and enslave the audience.
At the same time, stage photography is not suitable for capturing their personalities.
Their personality and character are at the very bottom of their being.
I wanted to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to use the camera to capture the personality of the glamour of flamenco. "
The Cante de las Minas festival gave the impetus to Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which he made portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers with a disk camera.
These portraits cite classical photography thanks to camera and theme selection.
However, the application of the various stylistic tools breaks down with traditional image representation and suggests modernity. The following idea faithfully reflects Bauer's idea of flamenco: "It is music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always fascinating."
It's not the dance, it's not the song or the music itself, it's the artist's personality, it's the character that cast the audience.
In the days of the El Fotomata gallery, the guiding motif of the works is to seek to meet the essential, artistic magic, which can be seen through the way of perception, existence and presentation.
The names of the famous flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, represent this collection of photographs showing 60 artists.
The project has also become flamenco-anthology, soon to be published an album covering the portraits presented at the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits two years ago prompted him to repeat the idea with the "Portraits of Veterans" series ("SportARProject").
Although the concept of Flamenco-people is slightly different, the photographer adds: "I like to photograph people, know them and enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, the most difficult genre of photography is portrait.
You meet people, people you sometimes don't even know, or people who only take a few minutes to take pictures.
But despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.
The exhibition selected from the portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled Flamenco-people, can be found in El Photomata Gallery at the parallel calle de la Mata with Alameda de Hércules until 16 October.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he's working on is "reckless."
The scene and the plot are still unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also working on writing his new novel. The main character of the novel is an Irish nationalist, Roger Caseman, who lived in Congo for 20 years and went through Amazon.
Yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia event, the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer admitted that his current work was "quite reckless" and "all signs indicate that he should not write the novel."
"If I were smarter, I would not, but I will do it, and I hope I will succeed in the end," he closed his presentation at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and opinions, which received hundreds of writers, historians and journalists in Aqueduct for four days, as well as thousands of visitors.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the most prominent participants in the festival of literature, and he has fulfilled his hopes.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend." His performance filled Juan Bravo Theatre.
After Félix Romeo's toast, he was received by a devoted audience. The public soon lost the hour, during which the Peruvian writer told him a wonderful memory and a great deal of humor about how he had developed his writing profession from the special adventure of his reading passion and the desire to live life; how to bridge the lack of inspiration through disciplined writing method, diligent documentation, much repair and rewriting; how his writing career was influenced by Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what his stories are built on.
The Latin American novelist admitted that it was impossible to measure or show whether the books would change our lives, but he added: "I do not think literature is a mere pleasure or a lifetime experience," because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to allow the seductions of ease and to bear responsibility for their calling.
Because of the step-up weather, the Pozoblanco farewell, the equestrian bullfighting, too, will be delayed.
The equestrian bullfighting, traditionally held as the closing chord of the Pozoblanco festivities, was cancelled last morning, after the future horsemen 'horsemen found the arena unsuitable for the fight.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, that there would be no bullfighting.
The weather conditions have seriously torn the series of festivities, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain left him with the second bullfight.
The leading characters, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, would have fought with the bulls in Castilblanco.
So they only had bullfighting on Friday.
The winner became Daniel Luque, and three ears brought me home as a trophy, and after the sophisticated and aesthetic struggle, they put him on his shoulder.
On the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante's two bulls gave a number of awards and trophies to an ear, but this was due to the audience rather than to its own performance.
But then came El Juli, who made little contribution to the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
The second bull, after a comfortable ride, managed to get most of the audience out of control.
A two-ton hashish van tried to get away from the traffic control.
It's 4: 50 in the morning.
The Basque Territorial Police carry out a traffic check on Armiñón (Álava).
The authorities will stop a van in which two people travel, and the passengers will try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of hashish, was not conspicuous at the same time.
The detectives chased the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man, was arrested and identified as A. A. J., said the Basque Government Department of Internal Affairs.
The man who was captured is charged with drug trafficking and falsification.
The case occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where a traffic check was carried out on the N-1 motorway.
When they tried to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, then suddenly gave gas and left the checkpoint.
The detectives chased him, and then the vehicle stopped a few miles away on the stop lane, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after examining the Iveco Daily truck, they seized its shipment, 2178 kilograms of hashish.
Hash bales filling the rear part of the vehicle have been transported by police departments to undergo a more thorough investigation and measure the drug.
In addition, the verification showed that the vehicle's fake registration plate did not match the data in the van's papers and that the arrest was also initiated for the purpose of forgery of a authentic instrument.
The Basque Regional Police continue their investigation, aimed at arresting the other suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, fled the motorway and, on the other hand, at determining the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old defendant, A.A. J., was transferred to the police to conduct the necessary interviews, and within a few hours, the court measures were initiated.
Actress Heather Locklar was arrested for driving under the influence of medicine.
actress Heather Lockley, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested by the police this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of medicine.
"A witness said that he was trying to leave the parking lot in Montecito with strange manoeuvres," said a spokesman to People magazine in California.
According to the witness, around 16: 30, Locktear "pushed the gas to the floor, cried the engine, tried to leave the parking lot forward and backwards, and went back several times through his sunglasses."
Shortly after that, the witness, who first probably didn't recognize the actress, saw Locklar stop on a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also called the police because he was "worried about Locklar's life."
When the police arrived, the actress was in her car, which partially disabled the highway traffic.
"Seemed confused," so patrols took him for drug and alcohol analysis to a specialised center.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was cooperative and alcohol consumption was almost immediately excluded.
Locklear was arrested and suspected of leading under the influence of an unidentified substance, was transported to a local prison around 19: 00, where he was released a few hours later.
Locktear came out of a sanitarium in Arizona two months ago, where he was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the Andalusian Federation of the IU (United Left) to take action in the Silva case
Mr Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary-General of the IU and the representative of the United Left today stated that the regional federation of the forces will take a decision on the case of former Young and Sports Council of Seville Municipality, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after he was accused of taking advantage of his family members using his position.
"In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case falls within the jurisdiction of the Andalusian organization," Lamazares pointed out the procedure which the party must apply to the former member of the Seville City Council.
On the other hand, the President of the IU stressed that "transparency 'should be borne in mind when detecting irregularities that Silva may have committed:" At IU has always gone ahead to ensure that such cases are fully transparent'.
He added that part of the training was "the strict code of ethics for civil servants."
"May blood," Garci's epic creation
The work of Benito Pérez Galdos National Epizodes inspired José Luis Garci, who recalled the famous anti-French uprising of Spain in the blood of May, which, with a budget of nearly EUR 15 million, is the greatest creation of his film.
Accordingly, the director attempted to illustrate in the work of the known novelist his admiration for human flow and social analysis. At the film show today, in the company of Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the popular audience of actors.
More than two and a half hours of May blood will be presented on Friday at the cinema and later, Telemadrid will project it as a mini-series in excess of four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdoz's literature, has achieved his childhood dream with this film. All thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who, three years ago, commissioned Madrid Province to make a memorial film for the 200th anniversary of the 2 May events in Madrid. Garci accepted the invitation on condition that the story was based on the National Epizodes.
The EUR 15 million budget was financed entirely by the Autonomous Province of Madrid and was a special opportunity for Garci: he was able to introduce the "confused Spaniards, who, by mistake, stood by the wrong leader, because the fight for independence led the country to a great disadvantage with the reign of Ferdinand VII," he said.
However, the director expressed regret that he could not count on the budget of Alatriste or Goya's phantoms, which was more than doubled in May's blood, and for this reason he was forced to leave out a few scenes in the script, which, as in many other cases, was recorded together with Horacio Valcárcellel.
So the director of the Renewal took the scenes with the actors he started rehearsals with before shooting. Casting wasn't because Garci thought it "humiliating," and because, as he said, "the director's profession is part of the theater and going to the movies to find out what's going on in the industry we're working in."
Several actors in the May blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga, or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, have not been on camera for the first time.
Garci, who has four Oscar nominations and an Oscar award, believes that this year's candidates representing Spain before the Hollywood Academy, i.e. the May blood, the Seven French billiards table and the finally enlisted Vak sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "even though it should be presented."
Garci doesn't expect awards with this movie.
"In the beginning, you think you're working for posterity, and then you realize that happiness is all that matters, and finally you're happy to have another film done," says Garci, with a 30-year career behind him.
Isabel Bayona recurs the life and art of the Seville dancer Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville commemorates another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana and moved to London with her parents at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dancing and an expert in East dances.
In his busy life, he fought as a pioneer for women's emancipation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf, or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and a vegetarian fighting against wearing a corset to prevent women's freedom of movement.
He started a dance and aesthetic revolution in war Europe, and his life dazzled Isabel Bayonn.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she recommended Tortola to me, whose personality really impressed me."
The flamenco dancer said: "Our goal is not to tell her life story, but to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances reminded me of flamenco styles.
Like the "butterfly dance" to the guayra or the "snake dance" tango.
"He danced senselessly and others said it was my style," he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary contributors: Miguel Poveda will now sing again after the Open Door at Isabel's lecture; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, wanted to work with a former student.
"Matilde plays the older Tortola, the mature woman.
I'm glad you said yes to my proposal, and I'm very honored to have you perform in my play. "
In addition, musical directors and guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón are involved in the production; El Pajaro is a batter, Rafa El Viola is a viola, and Juanfra Juárez is an actor who plays "the true diva is always a constant character that attacks his love."
The play shows a large part of the life of the woman who lives in London, but also travels through Europe, and she goes to distant landscapes at the time, including India, the United States or Italy.
"I wanted to commemorate him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but today he is no longer known and much less appreciated in his work," says Bayo.
The show starts tonight at 20: 30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Trienium, the diary of a newly married poet will also appear.
The first illustrative release of a newly married poet's diary will be the Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation will be part of the series of programmes entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Trienium (2006-2008) organised by the Cultural Commission of the Andalusian Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two of the two.
Thus the closing chord of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Trienium is the reopening of this work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prize-winning poet's memorial house, and the tour exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree." The exhibition opened this May, more Andalusian provincia was open and is scheduled to visit New York for the International Congress.
The Cultural Commission of the Andalusian Regional Government has acquired 800 copies of the diary of a newly married poet issued by Perdo Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso to promote the reputation and work of one of the most versatile Andalusian poets.
Without Paul Newman, America isn't so attractive.
"Sometimes God brings perfect people.
Paul Newman was like that. "
The quote came from actress Sally Field, who worked in the film "Victims of the Sense" with Newman, and reflects the shock and inertia that Newman's death caused in the American cinema chamber and throughout America.
And how hard it was for him to get the Oscar.
Retired in 2007,
And he was known to be ill,
But still, everyone was shaken by his death.
"Sometimes it is impossible to put our feelings into words, and I have now lost a good friend," said Robert Redford, in tears, "he has made my life better and this country."
No one was afraid that he might get ridiculous or exaggerated.
One of the heroes of the cinema and the country went away in a particularly dark time, which was shielded by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the desperate search for American self-respect and dignity.
When times are so difficult and many people lose their virtues easily and there are very few people we can look up to, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of the people, he actually embodied the platonic idea of beauty and justice.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and defender of lost and won cases, ranging from the anti-drug foundation established in memory of his first-born son who died of drug overdose to the creation of his home-style bio-food brand.
It was a real gift for a country that was having trouble surpassing its own nutritional culture.
The overwhelming wave of wonder traveled all Hollywood regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, said he was killed by an era and not a man.
Another Englishman, the Oscar-winning Sam Mendes, said that his work with Newman was clearly the highlight of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia, called Newman the greatest inspiration.
"He has set the bar very high for all of us," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today attempt to follow Paul Newman's way of life: they demand honesty and serious and distant privacy.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the middle of today's media session.
Still, some people try, and Paul Newman is his idol.
She was divorced once, but then she lived in a loyal marriage to Joanne Woodward for 50 years, and she would certainly have had several opportunities to be disloyal.
"Why should I eat hamburgers somewhere else if I have roast meat at home?" he said.
In heaven, you should be proud that your daughters on earth are also fans, which is not very common in America.
"None of his performances were as proud as the loyal husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather, and the devoted philanthropist," they say.
The rough road of the Madrid Olympics
Indeed, many of us dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after 2012 failed, it may become 2016.
But, I ask you, are we really prepared for this?
Because if we start yesterday's running race, I don't think we do at all.
They called it the perfect race, but in my opinion, it was the worst of the many I've ever been to.
It was characterized by a mass of nonsense, and once it had to be appreciated, and I would be the examiner, it would clearly fail.
But let's keep it straight and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the take-over of the serial number, which meant that we had to arrive early.
This is not a problem in itself, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at once (including the chip, to avoid standing in the future).
Well, that's not what happened.
At first they only gave me the serial number (first nonsense, that's why they went there earlier) and (after the usual line), what a surprise, it was only an S T-shirt (second nonsense, because my size is exactly XL)!
What world do we live in?
Or because of the crisis, they decided to save money and only buy cheaper, small-sized T-shirts?
But anyway, these things still fade from what happened on the day of the race.
Besides the fact that we had to pick up the chip at an awful early hour, the line lasted 15 minutes from arrival, and even the backpack had to be delivered.
The waiting lasted longer than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the event of a race of over 11,000 people.
So, as expected, the race started, and we haven't turned in the backpack yet, and when we finally did, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made it more pleasant to wait for more than 40 minutes, which was carried out by attempts at uprising and stand-attack.
I think we'll have about 500 pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, will not be able to get our placement with our actual time, because I assume my chip has misrecorded the launch.
If you ask me about the perfect race, of course I wouldn't have thought of that.
So I think we can continue dreaming about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for receptionist
At the MIT Emerging Technology Conference, Microsoft presented a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of artificial intelligence, which, however, is capable of carrying out some basic tasks. For example, it can call a taxi (or, in the case of Microsoft, a vehicle in the company's territory) based on the information that has been heard from the conversation.
This "receptionist" can use a camera and a format and facial recognition system to detect how many people are in the room, who they are - and even note what they are wearing - and hear and understand the key words of their conversations.
In addition, you can pool your presence based on your conversations.
In the presentation video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows she's not part of the company she's talking to, and she's not an employee of the company.
He asks if he came to see someone and makes sure he's coming to help you soon.
All without the big blue screen.
Impressive.
But, of course, this is the music of the future.
Currently, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said this week that Microsoft is changing strategies.
Windows 7 will be smaller and contain fewer ancillary programs.
Steve Ballmer realized that if computers were running only the necessary programs instead of commercial garbage, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish wax has been invented, given that Microsoft has added additional features and benefits to Windows in every new version.
Change of course will be refunded.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is increasingly in the background, and so is the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google had made the first move to become a Windows competitor.
Many people have rightly recognized that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element for hardware and software dialogue.
He plays the same role as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but the "death" of the operating system must be considered, not in absolute terms, but relative.
Ballmer's statement this week supports that idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more attention to the web browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time spent on browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is the use of most of the applications associated with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 has to be less than Vista.
Less cumbersome, less depressed, less complicated.
Microsoft's goal is to integrate its services on-line instead and ultimately make an alternative to Google.
They really need all this, so I'll give you an example of why.
I took this photo at the beginning of the month in a lounge for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the soda machine, he calls on a poster to use the company's browser. "Your browser. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft workers used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, last week, the delay in Windows Mobile 7's new version was announced.
It does not arrive at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of 2009, but rather in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to market Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
After all, the cell phone functions more and more as a computer.
But the slip, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will definitely ruin your business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This is what Pablo Picasso wore in Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick's Bloody Diamond, and Al Pacino in the Godfather of Francis Ford Coppola, as well as one of the basic costumes of the hardened gay consumer.
And while we're on the list of specials, we might as well recall the peace figure of the vanishing circus's kazzy mustache weight lift.
What are we talking about?
I mean, "tank," as the English people call it, but none of your competitors with le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles can compete.
First of all, because of his elegant name - even though he is only referred to as "Marcel" among friends - which is due to sport, according to legend, he was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex design, its unique logo and the small (barely recognizable) Belgian flag also show up among its competitors. The latter is carried by the most distinctive models hidden in the neck of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
Sports tops, vintage boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, sea shirts, baby clothes, mini-shorts - and we could even list them - are all part of the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Although it is also regrettable that they should be worn as underwear.
They're too good for that.
"I want to be a young mother, no matter who the father is."
He looks a lot like his brother, but he managed to achieve himself at the same time.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but she's full of energy.
Right now, the Cruz sisters are trying to play a bigger role in fashion.
For Monica, modeling means a lot more than some pretty and pretty girls giving their name to something.
He was present at the promotion of Mango's new seat in Paris and at the award of the most prestigious fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish company.
There's plenty of warmth and gentleness coming out of it.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We are presenting Mango's new autumn-winter collection, designed by my brother Penélope, and we are also participating in the announcement of the second race of the Mango Fashion Awards and the gala dinner in honor of Valentino at the Opera.
It's a busy day, that's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango, where did you draw inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the movies of the '50s and' 60s; we took over a lot from there.
And then, many times, I walk around the city watching women dress, change and mix their clothes - it's one of my favorite pastimes.
You also work as a dancer, an actress, and a fashion designer.
That's what I think, but after all, these three things are connected, because they have a lot in common.
Even when I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, and I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother's and dig into my aunt's wardrobe.
Well, that was you on Canaan. You almost made it to the amusement park.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to figure out our own style for classes and rehearsals so we can have fun looking in the mirror.
And in acting as an actress, you really identify with your role when you get the costume.
See, everything is connected to everything, and with all due respect to the designers and their expertise.
You just celebrated your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I like the '30s.
I think that's when women are really worth it, they've had enough experience, and they make less mistakes in life.
And the biological clock doesn't worry me.
Ever since I was a kid, I've been doing what I want, and it makes me feel really happy inside.
And do you want to be a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm gonna be a mother because I was born to be a woman, and I want to be a young mother, and I certainly don't want to miss that.
And as for the future father, no matter who it is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's just say a few words about the movie, and last year, you made several movies that weren't even shown.
Yeah, and I can't wait for them to come out.
I, who started at the theater, am very impatient and anxious, want everything right away, but of course I know that's impossible.
I look forward to the final hour and the search for the tomb of Christ.
I wonder how you feel about them.
I understand you made a debut on the runway with Naomi Campbell a few days ago.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go up on the runway as a model.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and she's simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London for her own organization called the Women for a Better World. I chose two Mango collections of my own.
People don't even know how kind Naomi is.
They talk so much about it, I know it, and I can assure you that half of it is not true.
On the other hand, I always look on the bright side of his work.
He asked me to do the fashion show for a noble cause, but if he wanted me to stand on my head, I'd do that, too.
If the fate of women in the third world is at stake, I know no such thing as impossible.
Retrieval DUIs will be obliged to install "Alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior would, after violating three drunk driving rules, require the driver to install a device that would prevent the vehicle from being started if the driver was in a state of drinking or not blowing into the structure.
The proposal was presented in June and is now being dealt with by the Office of the State's Attorney's Office, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
Since the aim of the project is to restore it to the market, the driver will also have to take part in a repeat course on transport education.
In addition to the Agency for Transport Safety, the pilot project includes the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute of Automotive Technology (FITSA).
According to the statistics, 30-75% of the cars arrested several times because of drunk driving get back in the car.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, as the system connected to the vehicle determines the level of alcohol in the air which is blown out of the air. If it is greater than permitted, or if the driver has not blown into the device at all, the system will not allow the vehicle to start.
The cost of the instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be borne by the infringer.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such instruments could reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people's lives could be saved every year by this rule.
The measure focuses on violations for two reasons: on the one hand, it is easier to prevent them from turning into crimes,
On the other hand, it is easier to introduce it, as the implementation of the legal reform is carried out in the usual context, while the necessary reform of criminal matters would require an amendment to the basic law.
The instrument is not available in any commercial form on the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
Tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which calls for the integration of the system into school buses, as a French model.
In Mexico, in closed shoes
As far as English is concerned, at 17: 40 p.m. on the date announced in the programme, the Spanish air force carrier of the Prince's Party of Asturias landed in the Presidential Voice of Benito Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already down, but it was still so hot, we could only see the royal couple leaving the plane using our hands as blinders.
At the foot of the stairs was the Spanish ambassador and other prestigious personalities.
A few hours ago, I asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Duchy Couple was coming to town for official visits.
Well, then there won't be an airport transfer for a long time... she's from here or something.
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, she just lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, or so...
But the Mexican press, they know all about the Asturias Duchess and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting for the red carpet of the airport hangar, the cordon created by 27 Marines, who provide protection for dignity.
The Prince appears, smiling, wearing a sea blue dress, and then the Duchess, in her long hair, in a tight suit, but not in the usual shoes that flash toes - perhaps warned that Mexico City was threatened by a storm.
For a moment, they stop and smile at the cameras, and then they enter the room where the official reception is to come.
At the gate of their hotel, which is one of the four largest hotels in the city, one of the Mexican television reporters is waiting for them.
The most valuable fashion fee
The most suitable place in the world for handing over a fashion prize is without a doubt Paris, and the most sophisticated and cool of all today's fashion designers are Valentino.
Mango recently announced the second competition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to bring the young talent of the fashion industry to the international stage.
The main prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the first Belgian winner of the competition, saw her own design clothes in the Mango window of the Paris boulevard Haussmann 54, and was almost relieved by the touching.
By the way, this is the company's second largest European business and has just opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest business is in London.
In the midst of the numerous events and the thanks to Valentino for the chairmanship of the jury, we finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris.
In the company of the most enjoyable Chagalos, the gala dinner was even more spectacular in Mango's presidential table.
Nati, who had recently passed away with a heavy heart and sadness, wore a piece of the Company and a few breathtaking beauties of ELAH. He accompanied Valentino to the main table of dinner in his honor, with his son Luis, nearly two meters tall.
Andik, the owner and host of Mango, entertained the guests, and they were so chivalrous with Baron Rotchil, that they ended up without a suit, because they both gave it to a lady.
Monica Cruz came into the store in her own designer pants and shirt, and at dinner she wore a sexy long black dress. At night's opera visit, Gaya Toledo was so wrapped up in the ballet room that she went to one of the bars and improvised a grand plie.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but he showed me some pictures of his son on his cell phone.
The next morning in Oliver Martinez, he was about two meters tall and motorised, and John Travolta arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris. He also brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said in advance that he did not want any fragrance in the room.
Stars under the stars of Paris.
Oh là là, c'est la vie.
1001, the stress relief number
Not 1,000, but 1,000, and one way to turn us off from chaotic and messy everyday life.
The good news is that we can find them all in a single book that arrives at bookstores on September 30th to bring peace with it.
It's almost torture to have a clock at 7: 00 in the morning, but it's even worse to think about how fast the world is forcing you to live every day.
The office is called tension, and the computer has back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two ways to overcome daily exhaustion and to bridge work problems.
No, this number is exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classical massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott offers a wide range of possibilities in her book, so that everyone can find the solution that can be adapted to her best and free minutes.
The stress-relieving work bears the title of the 1001 relaxation method, and the rest of it comes from Pearson Alhambra y DK to bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be removed from the workplace or from the world of personal relationships, this manual will certainly shake your faith.
In addition, it also provides other ideas that help to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to prepare 100% natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and become a central problem in your life of stress, it's time to sit back in your chair, relax and focus on reading.
Those who speak in their sleep
Some kids talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell them what happened to them that day, but those who talk when they sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary at first, but it's actually completely harmless.
This is called benign sleep disorder somniloquism.
It's quite common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure more people have been told he spoke at night.
In terms of its frequency, it can be completely rapsodic (for example, only once in patients with a high fever) or more regular (once a day, once a week or once a month), and usually the next day the child will not remember anything.
His appearance cannot be traced back to a single trigger.
It is often associated with other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night alarm, night bed urination (enuresis nocturna) or sleepwalking, but this is not legal.
As we have already mentioned, it can be a condition with high fever, or a phenomenon of stress or excitement.
In any case, it has been studied less so far.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be quiet, calm, it may be incoherent with words, murmur, but unlike all this, it may also appear in the form of shouting, crying, or a longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and contact a specialist. The study may reveal whether there is a problem of great anxiety and thus offer a solution.
As we have already mentioned, it is a benign phenomenon and therefore there is no cure unless it is associated with another manageable form of sleep disorder (e.g. insomnia or stress situation).
However, there are some things we can do, and here are a bunch of preventive measures:
Make sure the child stays calm before going to bed.
Choose soothing games and avoid the child watching scary or more aggressive TV shows or shows.
For children who are prone to nervousness or are more difficult to relax, we will teach them some relaxation methods to make it easier for them to find inner peace.
It helps the child sleep better.
If you do start talking while you're sleeping, let's try to keep our peace.
Remember, it's harmless to the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child.
It wouldn't be necessary, because the kid's unconscious, but he'd be thrown out of sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's actually sleeping and resting.
Remember, if there are times of intense anxiety associated with the phenomenon, it is advisable to turn to a specialist or to explore what causes the child to have a high degree of anxiety.
If you speak clearly (this rarer case), do not start asking to know anything about it.
It would be unnecessary, because when you sleep, you're not conscious enough to gather your thoughts.
On the other hand, you can only hear the speech, but you cannot see the images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of what you have heard and any conclusions you may have.
Never tell the kid they can question him about his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
This is causing a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's only a few minutes of harmless episodes.
At last, the Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, the Illhaeusern team finally took on a new momentum and won again in the home field.
Although there was no wild game, the yellow-and-black people were in multiple situations, of which one was eventually able to win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers had difficulty feeling the right rhythm.
The first gate shot was attempted by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann, but the distant ball had just touched the upper corner of the gate tree. Then Illhaeusern was placed on top, and the shots followed: Fonderflick tried a remote shot, and Hirn's shot went over the gate. Romain spicle and Diebold also attempted to shake the protection of Dannemarie with a remote attempt.
On the other side, the players encased themselves in a block in the middle field, and only the ever-moving Riahi was in a firing position.
The beginning of the second half was supposed to be crucial: Riahi and Temporale were first placed on the side of the Dannemarie. Immediately after that, the first goal was born: after Diebold's first shot, the ball was acquired by Marais of Ilhaeusern with an excellent position and then delivered to the gate (53 minutes).
But Illhausern's scorer could not enjoy the glory for long: 12 minutes later he was forced to leave the field, so his teammates had to fight at a human disadvantage.
Dannemarie, however, could not take advantage of its advantage: they did not cause much trouble for the domestic team, who had just pulled back a little bit to strengthen their defenses. Only the last seconds saved some excitement, when, after a great rush, the ball was very close to the gate tree.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy makes a detour to Brittany.
On Monday, the demonstration held by fishermen disabled the traffic of several Bretons and Normann ports, which is why the President of the Republic decided to visit the port of Le Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the demonstrators.
The latter promised to receive the President in a 'constructive spirit' and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would "come with concrete proposals'.
The presidential visit coincides with the meeting of the 'crisis committee', which was created by breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the increase in gas oil prices, as the oil price exceeded the average price of a record of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to David Martin, the President of the Republic's spokesman, the President will "discuss with fishermen the solutions that could help companies to regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers'.
The fishermen are determined to await Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
On Tuesday morning, in Morbihan and Calvados counties, traffic slowdown demonstrations were held, causing congestion of nearly 10 km long.
They also disabled the transport of Quiberon's yacht port, but the roads to Belle-île were not blocked.
The Quiberon peninsula has been harnessed with roadblocks.
On Monday, the sailors had already demonstrated their determination to burn tyres and pallets in front of the fuel warehouses at the British ports, while protests were taking place in Concerneau and Saint-Brieucs.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic coast and La Manche. For example, in the Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, fishermen did not board, while in Le Havre, about 20 ships prevented the traffic of commercial vessels.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Le Croisic, located in Loire-Atlantique County, closed the huge Total oil refinery blockade in the Donges.
However, the fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held at the Ministry by decision on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the 'crisis committee' must decide on Tuesday on its next move and participation at the meeting of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want their interests to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Commission, as the Committee did not support their efforts.
"The strike continues' because 'fishermen do not allow their demands' and 'refuse to travel to Paris', for example, Liliane Cariou, Chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Commission, announced.
Professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on gas oil currently pay around 50 cents for their litres, but believe that the operation of a ship would only become profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0,30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
The unforgettable title character of "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" in his home in Connecticut, died at 83 years of age, due to cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes paid tribute to the actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer does not change its transport plans for 2008
Despite the crisis threatening the world economy, the Brazilian aircraft company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest aircraft company in the world, Embraer, can maintain the plans and plans to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008, confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of the company.
In the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturing company is a major player in the Chinese market, especially for its 30-120-seat aircraft.
So far, Embraer has supplied 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group insurance company, restored by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets to repay its advance $85 billion, announced the Dominican edition of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international level of life insurance and American pension insurance, AIG would be relieved of almost all other business activities, the newspaper, which quoted the funds close to the case.
According to the Times, AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to examine the possibilities of sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The assets to be sold by AIG include the company's International Lease Financial Corp. aircraft leasing company, its 59% share in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance company and its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Times adds.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales.
AIG must quickly obtain liquid assets to repay the $85 billion loan granted to it by the US Government and thus assume the risk of losing up to 80% of its capital and losing its shareholders in an appropriate proportion.
Study by Paris Historique on Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange announced a historic decline on Monday after the Senate rejected the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan. The Dow Jones index dropped by 6,98% (which means almost 800 points in the past), and Nasdaq by 9,14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA) has fallen by 777,68 points and is closed at 10 365,45 points.
The largest (684,81 dot) drop in the index was registered on 17 September 2001 when the trade restarted following the terrorist attack on 11 September.
Nasdaq, based mainly on technological paper, closed at 1 983,73 points with a decrease of 8,81% (i.e. 106,85 points) in the expanded index of Standard & amp; Poor's 500, reduced to 1 106,55 points according to official closing data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was sick even when it opened, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it went deep.
With 228 'no' votes, Members refused to provide funds requested by Minister of Finance Henry Paulson against 205 'yes'.
The plan was voted down by nearly two thirds of the Republicans.
"From this, the market has detected bad signs, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan," says Lindsey Piegza, analyst of FTN Financial.
"This shows how much the market was expecting this plan," he added, expressing his concern that if such a plan were to be adopted a few days later, it would be "too late."
"If the plan is really doomed (...), then it will be on Fed (the American central bank - the agency) and the other central banks to deal with the crisis, and the credit terms will continue to tighten up" - warning Brian Bethune, the leading economist of Global Insight.
To further increase the sense of urgency, Piegza adds: "every day passed, another financial institution goes bankrupt" in the United States.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking business was bought by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly accelerated, which has required emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market 'not only has an American crisis but a global crisis', added by the FTN Financial analyst.
The bond market has been sharpening.
The return on the 10-year bond fell from 3,827% to 3,632% on Friday night, and the 30-year-old dropped from 4,357% to 4,161% on the previous day.
Obama won the first television duel
The first debate of the two American presidential candidates on Friday was followed by another one that had to decide whether John McCain or Barack Obama would be the winner of the duel.
Not surprisingly, both Republican and Democratic campaign leaders have declared victory to themselves in the television duel followed by a third of American households.
According to political analyst David Gergen, although John McCain's action was honorable, it was not "impressive enough" to stop the decline in his popularity: this is evidenced by the surveys carried out five weeks before the presidential election.
According to Gallup, the Democratic candidate is better at fighting: according to the results published on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage over McCain (44% and 49% respectively).
Among the most predictable yet indefinite electorate, 39% of those questioned say Obama will win, while 25% expect McCain to win, according to a survey by CBS.
Obama is expected to further increase his advantage with his partner, Joseph Biden, who promised to be great on Thursday. Biden is preparing for his first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
But Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: "It would be a mistake to underestimate Palin.
He's got good instincts. "
McCain in his seventies never fails to prioritise his own undisputed vast foreign policy experience, but also stresses his' naivety 'on these issues, which were at the heart of their first personal meeting.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand how..." has been said several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary for the presidency," said McCain.
This is the main attack area that has been exploited by the Republican TV ads that have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that he represents the future.
He wouldn't let himself be embarrassed, he said it properly and accurately.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, but Obama has already," interrupted the weekend of the broadcast of a Democratic ad that cast the eye of the Republican leader that he still did not assess the impact of the crisis on the American "people of the street."
"In 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you," said Obama yesterday in front of 20,000 people who gathered in the rain in North Carolina for the election meeting.
He did not even say the words "middle class" or "workers." The confusion in the financial world undoubtedly benefits Obama, who the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy on the verge of collapse.
"The next seven points may prove to be turning," said Charles Schumer, the influential Democrat Senator.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a veteran of the Clinton Government, says Obama has "excellent instincts in the economy" like Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the eyes of the Democratic presidential candidate, the current crisis is the 'final judgment over the eight-year bad economic policy created by George Bush with the support of Senator McCain'.
The Senator of Illinois has reaffirmed that, despite the stock market fluctuations, he will be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that his primary objectives include the creation of potential energy independence in the country through the use of renewable energy sources and the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, is planning to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidential candidates carefully avoided the questions relating to the bank rescue plan of USD 700 billion (EUR 470 billion): the extremely unpopular plan was adopted last night by Congress.
Minsk: "Have you noticed that there was an election here?"
Young people and opposition protested on Sunday evening in the capital of the Belarusian capital to reject the expected outcome of the parliamentary elections.
On Sunday evening, hundreds of Belarusians gathered in Minsk's main square after closing the polling rooms to protest against the falsification of election results.
Although results have not yet been published, a number of young protesters against President Alexandr Lukashenko have said: 'Mr Dictator, resign'.
Some people admit that they didn't even go to the vote: "Why would I go? They'll do whatever they want with my vote anyway," says a young man.
The demonstrators do not believe that the regime, which has tried to make itself good in front of foreign observers in order to make contact with the European Union, would be ready to change democratic systems.
If the elections were to be considered clean by the observers, they could resolve the sanctions imposed on the country, which denied 40 Belarusian leaders their visas and froze some bank accounts.
However, according to the opposition, the elections did not take place clearly.
"We were kept away from the election committees, and our observers were not allowed to participate in the ballot counting," said Yuri Potyemkin, who organized from the twelve parties, thus being a spokesman for a highly heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
"The changes were purely anonymous," emphasized Aleksandr Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. "The point is who is counting the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition get into Parliament, it means they have been appointed, not elected.
But their access to Parliament allows them to sit on television, sit in the country's regions and submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore take action in political life because it is' to initiate dialogue with the European Union '.
Because if our deeply indebted economy against Russia is in crisis and we are not able to renew, we risk being under Russia's authority.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the European Organisation for Security and Cooperation, which monitors the election process, will accept the result of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate appears to be too high and that the broad organisation of the preliminary vote (which was attended by 26% of the voters in Minsk) has given rise to any manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there has been an election here?" he asked the social Democrat Aleksandr Kozulin, who was released in August as the last of the prison, where he was held as a political prisoner.
No one was in the polling rooms.
In Parliament, there will be up to five opposition representatives, namely those who are most in line with the leadership.
The silence of the night is at October Square again.
And on television, President Lukashenko and the members of the Central Electoral Commission are happy.
Blood's safe again.
The Hema-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday. President Dr. Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate because Hema-Québec has now become one of the safest and most effective blood donors in the world.
Most importantly, he managed to regain the trust of people, which was severely swayed by the scandal in the 1980 and 1990's infected blood.
As is known, the national blood reserve treated by the blood supply service to the Canadian Red Cross was infected with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
Following the drama and the general uproar, the government of Canada, led by Judge Horace Krever, launched an official investigation in February 1994, which was designed to shed light on the circumstances that led to the tragedy and to make proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever's delay in submitting his report, some provinces set up their own committee to plan a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee completed this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one is the Québeet server Hema-Québec, and the other is the Canadian blood supply company responsible for all other provinces and the two Territories.
"When the Hema-Québec began its activities in 1998, only 38% of the people had confidence in Québec's blood supply system," said Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
"In the coming years, however, as a result of improving the safety of blood products and our work in this area, we have managed to regain people's trust." Décary proudly states that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the people in Quebec believed Hema-Québec to be reliable.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that 'trust is extremely fragile'.
Since the creation of Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, it has applied the precautionary principle.
During this period, many cases of mad cow disease, the new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, have been discovered in Europe, the doctor, who has been controlling the company since its foundation in 1998.
"We had no idea if this disease was spreading through blood.
Therefore, we have been relying on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever- and Gélineau reports. Thus, if we are unsure about this and there is a risk of serious illness, we must apply exclusion measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob is the disease that causes brain changes and inevitably leads to death.
Therefore, in April 1999 we did not accept blood from persons who have spent more than one month in the UK since 1980.
And a few years ago, it was unquestionably found that the disease was spreading through blood.
"This case has convinced us that it makes sense to apply the precautionary principle."
In 1999, there was a technique on the market that allows for a much more sensitive diagnosis of HIV virus. This is the nucleic acid test (NAT), which can directly detect the virus itself in the blood of blood donors, rather than the antibodies to the virus that have been used before.
With the NAT test, we could shorten the window period, which lasts as long as the virus can be detected in the blood using our technical means, explains the expert.
This period could be reduced for a period of less than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk of blood transmitters infecting the blood stock unknowingly and that this could not be detected.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of the spread of AIDS through blood transfusion.
Nowadays, the risk of someone getting HIV-infected blood is 12 million to one.
"In other words, that means we should distribute 12 million blood products until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400 and 500 thousand blood products each year, more than 24 years should pass to allow such a case to occur and someone to be infected with HIV by a blood product.
I think that anyone can now accept or prescribe blood transfusions in order to restore health, says the number one head of the Hema-Québec.
"The challenge of the next decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogen gets into the system.
After all, it was only last year that the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, gets into the blood with insect bites.
We must therefore be constantly on our guard, 'continued Dr. Décary, and then stressed that apart from emergency reserves, Hema-Québec must provide sufficient permanent reserves.
"The ageing of the population increases the demands.
Since anti-cancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the stock of blood taxes, as the number of people in the network who are capable of giving blood represents only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years of age, fulfilling the eligibility criteria can give blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they are infected with AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have been in a country where malaria destroys are not eligible for blood donation for a year.
"With these three percent, we have enough to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare that we run out of supplies.
However, we need to increase the number of blood taxes to the extent that the existing ones age, because they can't give blood after a while.
But it's very difficult to convince people to give blood, but it's even harder to keep them and get them to become regular blood donors.
In this rushing world today, a man has less than an hour to go out and give blood, "says Francine Décary.
Hema-Québec, which is an annual budget of $297 million, provides not only blood products but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs and skin tissue, which are used almost exclusively for severely burned persons.
These tissues are analysed, modified and frozen and placed at Hema-Québec, which also manages a single public stem cell bank in Québec.
Once only the umbilical cord treated as medical waste can be obtained from blood that is rich in stem cells and allows for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated entering our bank for the millennium umbilical blood sample, and we plan to remove over a thousand new samples a year.
At the beginning of next year, we will probably start offering them for organ transplants, "said Dr. Décary, who said that the cord blood removal program is very popular these days.
"Many mothers are sad because they do not have the opportunity to do so" - it is true, because Hema-Québec is not able to make this complex and costly program available at all Québec hospitals.
Football - in the semifinals of the Impact
The Montreal Impact team defeated Seattle Sounders yesterday at 3: 1 and reached the semifinals with a total of 4: 3. This was the second and decisive match of the quarter finals that took place at Saputo Stadium.
The final goal was won by Antonio Ribeiro, mid-fielder, in the 90th minute of the match.
While the first half passed without a goal, in the second, the two midfield players of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino, found themselves in the enemy's web.
Only Roger Levesque of the Sounders team managed to play the Matt Jordan goalkeeper.
Let us remember that on Friday's first match, Impact lost 2: 1 from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, in the suburbs of Seattle.
The Impact in the semifinals is playing Vancouver Whitecaps.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which lost Whitecaps at 3: 1 at the first game, won 4: 3, but in the semifinals, Whitecaps came in with a total of 5: 4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches will be clarified today.
In a nutshell - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadian's favorite triad is ready for another season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led great attacks, and in the end, the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers 3: 2 in the penalty shots last night at Centre Bell.
Kostitsyn, the number one star of the meeting, scored a goal. Plekanec closed the match with two, and Kovalev closed the match with a goal, which was the fourth of the team's six preparation games.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who scored the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian player warns.
"I need another game to make me feel really good."
"He tried to get too much out of himself in the first third," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he was happy with the outcome of the game.
He's got a huge ovation. "
Charest's northern aspirations
The Prime Minister does not rule out that the election will start this year.
The Liberal Party meeting was hardly over, Jean Charest was already in Jean-Talon, Québec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) was ready to win the interim election today.
This ambitious long-term goal was formulated by Jean Charest at the Liberal Party meeting in Quebec yesterday. The speech was enriched with visual elements, while the President was trying to focus on the point.
During his performance, behind his back were images similar to "Moulin à images."
On the three huge projectors there were impressive images of each other: dam, mining, Québec on "Google Maps," maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this autumn, although he added that his schedule was very tight.
The 'Northern Plan' is the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's vision of the future of Québec, which is embodied in a 'new economic area', which includes a labour agreement with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and several agreements with Ontario.
Recently, opening up to the North (i.e. the northern area starting at latitude 49) has often been mentioned in the speeches of the Prime Minister, but he has never held a lecture on this subject.
The head of state, however, was merely insisting on explaining why he considered the North to be "a treasure mine with enormous potential." However, he did not mention the time factor, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
It has highlighted only a few development opportunities: primarily water power plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which are further stimulated by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north, "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds," said Charles.
This area, which is "twice the size of France," is our territory, Québec.
It is not only in us, but within us, "repeated the head of state, emphasizing that it is intended to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Québec's development was largely determined by the relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abitibi, the Québec design work, the James Bay...
"This is ours, our future," he added, after looking at the huge map behind his back, taking a stage break.
The North, situated on 70% of Québec's territory, includes a part of Labrador, which Québec has always demanded, said the Prime Minister at the press conference.
"This is our historic resolution, which has been confirmed by all governments.
There is a line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and if there is an opportunity, I will reaffirm the same resolution on behalf of the Government, 'said he.
On the other hand, 'we need to rethink our view on the North in the light of climate change', the Prime Minister said, talking about the northwest passage that opens every year as a result of the melting of the Arctic ice.
In the opinion of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, occupying the territory is an important task.
And what about the natives of the area, the Indians and the Eskimos?
The Prime Minister has stated that the Government of Québec is paying special attention to them and that the plan will be of great benefit, especially for young people.
The two ministers belonging to the various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau, who were the emissary of the Party Québécois in Ungava, have already begun to consult with about 30 local communities.
The Interministerial Committee, led by Benoît Pelletier, has also begun to operate, in which Julie Boulet (Minister of Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out the possibility of a large-scale meeting, not necessarily a summit, where they "create a common vision '.
The North would otherwise be developed in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be coordinated, organised and environmentally friendly, "said the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this' vision 'as being in line with the ideas of the liberal prime ministers before him.
"Just like the former Liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from challenges."
This was, by the way, one of the recurring topics of the weekend that began with the big cocktail party celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's election to party.
One of the decisions adopted proposes that the Beauharnois power plant be renamed Adélard-Godbout barrier.
"The politicians of our party, including Godbout, the founder of Hydro-Québec, Lesage, the silent revolution and the national distribution of water plants, or Bourassa, known as the father of James Bay, all knew how to forge the future," said Jean Charest.
At the press conference he also quoted another - true, conservative - John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister "Roads to the North," 1957-1963.
As regards the plan of the Eastmain1a-Rüper dam, President Charest pointed out that the installation was planned for 2012.
"Let this remain between us, but I plan to be there," he said to his faithful, and his statement was received by a loud applause storm.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and probably in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote to be held this autumn, which is also possible by law.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was already full, because he took on duties at the Federal Council meeting in China and at the Québec-New York Summit.
The party meeting at the end of the week proved to be an excellent platform for the Liberal President to express nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without thinking. This is mainly about 'constitutional aspirations': in particular, the liberal party demands the recognition of Québec's specific character in the Constitution.
They also want Québec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Board and these members to have veto rights in relation to decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, received the main points of the Northern Plan skeptically.
The leader of the Party Québécois, Paulina Marois, once again raised the North Québec development policy, which was introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the liberal government that was in power in 2003 refused to apply this policy.
If they had not done so, 'we would have moved forward today', she thought, in agreement with Mrs Marois Françoise Mercure, who was the candidate for the vote in Jean-Talon today.
The ADQ opposition party supports the government's acceptance of the Northern Plan.
"But we want this not to be a mere charade," said the party leader Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, returning from his freedom today.
Leaves - A disgraced country
Vic Toews, Minister of the Harper Cabinet (by the way, "Minister of Justice"), took the liberty last summer to call Louise Arbour the "shame" of Canada.
This is the way to desecrate a woman who has constantly fought for the truth and deserves all our admiration - it tells us a great deal about the people around the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper himself.
This is therefore our government, who has not delivered its own citizens from the Guantánamo concentration camp alone from the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely doesn't take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager at the time of the crimes he was charged with.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing the Geneva Convention, has denied its word and let a child soldier die in inhumane circumstances.
The only government to turn justice into a puppet show while investigating the guilt of a defendant.
Let us remember that the Association of UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers also demands the return of Omar Khadr to a fair trial in Canada.
And our government overlooks the torture: it doesn't matter to him that a young adult has already been completely destroyed, and years of torture have probably sealed his fate for life.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently in the midst of the treacherous destruction of our rights, our freedom and our democracy. "Democracy": Harper continues to voice this word, which sounds simply an empty voice from his mouth.
The time has come when morality no longer exists: they can arbitrarily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen in the will of the leader of a government that has been in minority (and what can come after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found by a party that praises the Virtue, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is trampling on the values of which our country has been given the good name and dignity of our country.
Dear Mr Toews, shame is more like it - not elsewhere to look.
Opinion - The Orwellian Speech of Barrick Gold
On September 17, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy CEO of the Barrick Gold mine in Canada.
According to Orwelli, Garver claims that the world's largest gold-producing company has filed a six-million-dollar libel suit against three authors and a small-money publishing company to initiate a so-called "public debate."
Although judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in libel suits, is made not on the basis of the truth, but on the basis of the law.
It's no surprise that Garver kept quiet about this fundamental difference.
Is it really the best way for Barrick Gold to have a public debate is to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to his?
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of the Noir Canada book must spend significant amounts on defence and struggle in an unequal fight where on the other side is an army of lawyers supported by almost inexhaustible resources in the mining industry.
In such an unequal fight, they often use the tactic of destroying the defendant and making friendly agreements, which not only silence the contrary, but also intimidate those who would try to deal with the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views in public.
Although in many other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this is done differently, in Canada, the disputing parties usually do not hit each other with sticks, but tell their thoughts.
The mine would therefore have had to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in the press, media and publications, paying independent research groups that could shed light on the issue.
But it seems that Barrick Gold does not trust public opinion, and in one move, it is pushing aside the requests and letters written to protect the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he can initiate a 'public' debate if, at the same time, he disregards the opinion of this public?
In the vice-president's mind, this is probably just a word for a well-paid lawyer, not for the entire population of Canada: the meaning of the concept is narrowing down a lot.
In a democratic state, even those who abuse others deserve freedom of speech.
Barrick Gold, on the other hand, does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are mainly supported by the public because it condemns the harsh process of the mine.
The public is prepared to listen to Barrick and to make a judgment, but it would do so on the basis of civilised arguments, rather than by an action for silence for many. (In the context of the term 'public debate', Barrick Gold recently called in writing to the authors of Noir Canada to refrain from using this term.)
In addition to Garver's surreal interpretations, Barrick Gold's procedure is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for truth, which are building stones for all democratic societies.
The whole procedure denies the right to invoke credible resources, something to discuss facts and interpretation, which form the basis for intellectual activities.
If, in a country like Canada, you can only study and discuss matters that are not good for rich companies in today's world, who will take the liberty of doing so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted an open and transparent debate, this could be done according to the scientific standards applied by Noir Canada's authors.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have been able to deal with disputes, disagreements and conflicts for a long time.
Barrick Gold's reckless process clearly shows that, contrary to its assertion, it is not in the mood to have a debate.
This means a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of Canadian public debates, and it is time for governments to put in place measures to limit legal proceedings for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue mission - Democrats and Republicans agreed
Yesterday, the Republicans and Democratic leaders of the Bush Government and Congress finally reached an agreement on an economic rescue mission, which has been the biggest plan since the great economic crisis in the 1930s.
The 700 billion US dollar plan to stop the financial crisis that has been raging on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
Essential points of the plan: more effective control of implementation by Members; new mechanisms to ensure the repayment of the State funds envisaged; new provisions to keep the number of houses seized due to non-payment; right of access to the salaries of the managers of the companies receiving assistance.
American finance minister Henry Paulson, Nancy Pelosi, president of the American House of Representatives, and Judd Gregg, the Republican representative in the trial, announced the good news yesterday, a few minutes before midnight, after the two-day marathon trial was over.
"We have made great progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets," said Henry Paulson, representative of the Bush Government.
"We have done everything to save the real economy and American citizens from the current crisis on Wall Street," said the Democrat.
"The most important aspect is that if we don't do this, then there will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of Americans," said Republicans Judd Gregg.
The trial was accelerated in the last few hours, in fear that another failure would have an adverse effect on the mood of investors.
The agreement was granted until the stock market opened this morning.
The two presidential candidates, who joined the negotiations late, have shown willingness to agree, but they have nevertheless expressed their lack of satisfaction at the fact that the situation has escalated to the end.
Senator Barack Obama has attributed to himself the extension of the agreement with elements such as provisions relating to the preservation of house property or the payment of the heads of companies assisted by the State.
"When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps to ensure that other people are irresponsible, it is not very welcome.
"But these steps are necessary," he said on a television show in America.
And when his opponent, John McCain, was asked by another network to vote in favour of the proposed plan, he replied, "I would like to know the details, but I hope so."
"What I have read in broad terms is that it is something that we all need to digest and that we can move forward with.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable, "he said.
According to the 700 billion-dollar plan, taxpayers' money would be used to buy the dubious demands of American financial institutions, something at risk, unsalvageable assets.
The plan was preceded by a 14-month crisis, which led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans) and then spread to other debt (commercial) securities and, finally, the freezing of liquid resources and the deregulation of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was overthrown by a group of Republicans last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed to provide certain "toxic" tools for firms in difficulty rather than buying them up.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which provides that if the government has to bear losses within the framework of the programme for five years, it may impose new taxes to recover its resources.
As part of the new plan, a tranche of $250 billion would first be paid; this could be followed by an additional 100 billion if the President considered it necessary.
The payment of the remaining $350 billion should be approved by Congress by another vote.
In return for assistance, Washington will acquire a share in the subsidised companies, which will give it dividends and which it can sell after the crisis has been brought down.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the seizure of property to cover the mortgage loans covered by the plan, and may also set a maximum rate of pay and severance payments for the managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The designers of the plan would like the plan to be voted on today by the House of Representatives and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan will be approved.
Because yesterday, statements against the plan were repeated among both Republicans and Democrats.
"It is clear that Washington will not hear your voice," said Republicans Scott Garrett, a member of the House Financial Committee.
"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is nothing that would benefit taxpayers. "
Brad Sherman, a Democrat representative who runs a small congressional group called the skeptical faction, presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred excellent economists, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to ask Congress not to hurry and to look carefully at which route he chose," said Sherman yesterday.
At the same moment in Europe, they understood once again that this is a global crisis.
Following a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they nationalised part of the Fortis banking group to EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French BNP Paribas announced that it would not buy up its competitor on the brink of bankruptcy after losing EUR 2 million (USD 2,9 billion) due to the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With the 85,000 employees at Fortis, it is one of the 20 largest European banks and the ten largest insurance companies.
"This is not money thrown out," said the Dutch Minister of Finance Wouter Bos yesterday.
"In return, we will gain voting rights and influence in the bank.
This is precisely something that depositors and households appreciate now that the situation is likely to be uncertain. '
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be planning to nationalise another bank that has been swept away by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the ongoing loans of Bradford and Bringley, of which real estate loans account for £41 billion (USD 75,5 billion).
The Spanish Santander bank announced yesterday that they were going to buy up British bank subsidiaries and customer holdings.
Bradford and Bringley, after this Northern Rock, would be the second bank the British government has wanted to nationalise since the beginning of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Farewell to the acting idol
Beautiful azure eyes, some say, are his main card, others say he was his greatest weakness.
Have you ever been rid of a narcissistic mirror by a charming American actor with a smile?
Yes and no.
Through his shame, sensitivity and innate talent, he was also far removed from the style of trombone, which is the existence of the true monstrudes of the art world.
But what a huge career you've made.
Paul Newman died of lung cancer in Connecticut on Friday, 83 years old, one of the last icons of American cinema flower age.
He was less monumental than Brando, whom he resembled, and who, for a long time, was a competitor on film. In his roles, he was more restrained and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also proclaimed freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The blending of blood often results in extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a child of a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
European roots have contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only increased his merit.
After all, he found himself a country devoted to the ideal of "self-made man" and the idea of a warrior broke in the Pacific War. In the early 1950s he studied in the drama class of Yale University and then at Actor's Studio in New York, before the theatre, television and a short time later in the cinema.
In addition to being a leading driver of civil rights, he reached second place in 1979 at the Le Mans 24-hour race, and was also considered a sex symbol, although since 1958 he has been happily married to actress Joanne Woodward.
Now we'll never know the shadows of this mysterious, private, dedicated actor who hated the sparkle of show business, which will remain a mystery forever.
He was an honest man, in the most noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week was a shock to movie fans: in his great roles, we can only see him on the black screen of memories.
Looking through his life's work, we've had the seventh American art rolling through us, and the cinema has been changing for more than 50 years.
We are reminded of the charming cowboy "Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid" (1969) and his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor), a young man whose role we saw in the Tennessee Williams processing "Cat on the Hot Tin Roof" in 1958.
From recent times (1990) we can remember him as a sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is faced with his old age by the fact that his marriage has not fulfilled his hopes.
Paul Newman also had a lot of other faces in his films.
In Robert Wise's film "Someone Up," the unforgettable performance of the stormy criminal boxer Rocky Graziano, which was originally intended for James Dean, and after his death, began Newman's acting career in 1956.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in a brilliant work called "The Big Bad," which won the Oscar for the best movie in 1973.
Robert Rossen played a bitter, vengeful pool player in his brilliant film "The Svindler" (1961) and returned in a similar role to Martin Scorsese's "The Color of Money." In 1987, he received his only Oscar prize from nine nominations.
It's changing times, but it's always the same face: it was him.
He's always been like this.
The period of his career was marked by changes in ages.
The younger ones are known mainly from George Roy Hill's "Ice Breaker" cult film (1977), where Reggie Dunlop, the coach of an ice hockey team, works with unusual methods.
Fans of the Coen brothers, however, saw him in 1994 in "The Big Jump."
The line was closed in 2003 by Sam Mendes' "The Way of Damnation," which was the last to appear in the role of an Irish mob boss.
Unlike many movie stars who left the screen relatively soon, Newman remained in the spotlight for a long time, even though he condemned Hollywood with its glitter, luxury and hypocrisy.
The French film director Bertrand Tavernier considered it not without all humor as "the living rebuttal of underplaying": he thought his game was too powerful.
The profession, however, was not always gracious to handsome Paul Newman, who for a long time had just fallen on his lap in the role of film.
However, he played less often young and successful characters: he was more likely to form figures living on the edge of society - neurotic, alcoholic, malignant or hopeless - whose drift and rebellion he was able to restore with perfect credibility.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face, a truly pushy and sensitive man in his soul.
In the 1968 film "Rachel, Rachel" (an adaptation to the novel by Canadian writer Margaret Laurence), Joanne Woodward, starring the fine portrait of a melancholy woman.
And with the film of "Harry and his son" made in 1984, he commemorates his son, Scott, who died of drug overdose, with a film of restraint and sadness.
Yesterday, Newman's numerous admirers remembered the actor. His close friend and old fellow, Robert Redford (with whom they played together in "The Great Trouble" and "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid") said with grief: "His presence has made my life and the world better.
Generosity and the joy of being: it was the secret to the vibrant personality of this great actor that we have now lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his struggle for civil rights, the environment, independent film production and his remarks about Hollywood's outbursts are clouded.
Many times we saw his face smiling at the packaging of sauces, sauces, biscuits and other foods, and he did it with a bad taste in his mouth, though at first he thought it was funny.
However, the proceeds of such sales have always been transferred to the Foundation for Children with Diseases.
Newman never sat on his laurels: he remained committed to the profession all along.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote: "Your father was always and unimaginably grateful for his fortune.
It was a privilege for me to be here. "
It is also a privilege for us to accompany the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
He was a model citizen, above all.
What was produced in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of criminal charges against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politician and his associates are charged with crimes of particular concern, including counterfeiting of documents, which have been committed continuously and commercially in a criminal organisation.
According to the prosecution, the tender money obtained was used for their own purposes and the performance of the tasks was often confirmed by incorrect invoices.
The public and municipal funds, in total some 65 million HUF, were moved in part into the cash register of the Young Left and partly into the pockets of individual persons.
The method described by the investigating authority was that the tender money received was collected on the basis of cost accounts which had not been properly executed and that the associations had never complied with the undertaking.
According to the indictment, most of the bills were fake.
These are the sober-town market where the bills were purchased, and the circular stamps were manufactured on Kiskunhalas.
And the names of the companies that were to be created in the account were, among other things, decided on the Balaton-Highlands tour to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his last statement, he had to look at pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption there, and then, as a model, the invoices to be submitted for applications from, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the social and labour wallet and the Capital Municipality.
Most of these were recorded by István Lados, his partner, András Őri, who, according to our information, wrote mostly the reports needed to obtain the aid.
One of lados' study trips was a brewery.
According to the two accounts issued by the Zuschlags, dated 2003, the restaurant provided a meal for 90 members of the Commissioner Point Association.
However, so many people, according to the CEO, would not have been able to fit into the restaurant at the same time.
Similarly, the account issued to the Foundation for the Better Future - later together for the Third millennium - was full of formality and content errors in the summer of 2002.
There was only three rooms, and more than ten people could not sleep in it one night, and yet the bill was for one hundred and thirty guests.
But the imagination forms were overstated even when they marked the also catering Pigal Kft., which, according to the information given to the prosecution, did not contain the documents for the Better Future and the name of Oppie.
The head of the company, Győzó Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was called to the D.A. 's office and had bills, he immediately knew it was false documents.
"Our business name and tax number were in the wrong place on the stamp."
He added that, beyond the formal reasons, it was not right that the bill said that a hundred people had been housed, because they had eleven rooms in which there was not so much room.
In addition, the bill was for catering, while their restaurant had been off the table for a long time.
Neither did the zealous accountants follow the fact that the Budapest travel agency they are looking for is organizing only foreign roads, so in Botorul, a Hungarian travel service was designated as a service in the cash payment account, which also did not correspond to the company's accounting practice.
Moreover, as has been found in the course of the investigation, VAT was included in the document, even though the travel activity to countries outside the European Union was free of VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Rétuppip Kft for the Better Future, because the company's services are not charged by the 25%, but by 15% VAT, and the hotel employees only issued a machine bill, but the bill was made by hand.
In addition, "exhibitors' failed to account for the fact that road freight transport was designated for a company as an activity carried out, which was revealed by the prosecution procedure, which was not carried out by the company which was originally based on investment advice.
In addition, it was also due to formal differences - not a proper account format, not a true stamp - that the accounts for the Third millennium Foundation, the 21st Century Cultural Association and the Commissioner Point were false.
Just like Ravenna Bt. or the sports camp in Kunfehérno, whose representatives denied that the accounts would have been issued by them.
The forgers did not pay attention, for example, to the fact that HIB Kft. was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the Young City Association group ate ate there, which is why the company's liquidator denied, as far as we know, that he would have issued the paper.
I was posted knowingly.
The other group of account issuers is those who were aware that they had to issue a fictitious account.
At the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists, the Chance for Budapest Foundation has issued an account for the Third millennium Foundation for about four million HUF.
The head of the Collab Ltd., according to the indictment, was persuaded by one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, to issue the fictitious account.
He also worked with the Zuschlags, the Biogue Kft, which is currently in liquidation, which was responsible for the Better Future Foundation in 2003, the Atlas Association and the Red Pine Association, with accounts issued for roughly HUF 5 million, which had no real economic activity.
Neither is money movement, because the accounts that were made were then reworked, but the organisations have already forgotten to include this in their documents.
The next group of companies that issued the invoice belongs to the accused.
Thus, Ivan Kubatov was responsible for the service of the Ukrainian CEO of Delta Trió Kft, based in Budapest, dealing with fuel and car trafficking.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer devices in October, November and December 2005, worth about HUF 18 million.
According to the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Ltd, Kishkunhalas, which has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
The CEO of this company was a Romanian man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have forwarded the company's documents between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Kubatov admitted in the course of the investigation that he had issued an account on behalf of the Cf. to Atlas, Hoppa and the Third millennium Foundation together, and that he had taken up their consideration.
In particular, at the request of Iván Kubatov, Romanian masons founded Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft and Jos-Investment Bt.
But none of the companies actually worked, which the defendant said was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, it was useful for the companies because, at the request of Zsolt Szente, who produced the company's papers, he issued accounts on behalf of the companies to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlas and the Y-Generation.
In the name of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has provided a total of 15 accounts to the organisations of HUF 14.2 million.
The prosecution believed that 10% of the amounts on the accounts and the VAT hit Kubatov's hand.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt to issue fictional accounts, these were made for the sure point application.
In January 2006, the Y-Generation and the Association submitted a tender for Modern Hungary to the socialist party's popular organization, the Dánchics Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won 500-500 thousand HUF, but the amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the tender.
In order not to find out, five fictitious accounts from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were found, by the way, during the search of the premises of Árpád Kemechei at his educational wallet.
At the trial, some of the defendants, like they did at the D.A. 's office, are likely to report on the process of making the account.
It can be most interesting if you are the prime defendant, János Zuschlag, who decides to appeal to everything.
His testimony is not very detailed, and although he has repeatedly promised to speak in full, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in its interest, perhaps the majority of the damage, 50 million HUF, in exchange for the reimbursement, was made a deal with him by the socialists, and Zusi took the fall.
Who, by the way, may have been offended today, since his requests to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. to arrest him at home, were constantly on deaf ears.
While the perpetrators of much more damaging and unrewarding economic crimes can walk freely or at least await the end of the proceedings against them in their own home, he has no opportunity to do so.
Psychology of overbidding: why are we giving out more money?
In the auctions, buyers tend to spend more money, overestimate the goods.
The neurologic-economic basis of this known - and seemingly irrational - behavior has been revealed by neurologists and economists at the University of New York.
According to the study published in the journal Science, people do not want to be left behind in a race such as the auction of eBay, so they also pay too high a price.
Research was trying to map this "game" nervous system scheme through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group participated in an auction, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method was used to test the active brain areas of the experimental persons.
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but during the auction game, in which an overbidding of the other party is essential, the complex under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, was activated intensively when the game was lost.
This brain area plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system in addition to several other functions.
Therefore, according to researchers, price uplifting can be explained by avoiding the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the research group of economists also conducted a financial follow-up investigation.
In this three groups bid against a partner under different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the realistic value of the product concerned and they made their bets.
Another group was also promised that if they were won out of the game, they would get another $15 in reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 just before the auction, but in the event of a losing auction, the members of the group also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, only that one of them was stressed about winning or losing.
However, in evidence of the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the "against loss" team were willing to bet higher than the control group and the winning group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previously existing economic theory.
To date, they have only explained the events at the auction with the joy of victory and risk avoidance.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped to resolve the discrepancy between these two theories with a third explanation now, "said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
There are about half a billion people in the world who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and among the leading causes of death in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned.
There are hundreds of thousands of people with hepatitis here, but they only treat seven thousand, which is why patients often don't know they're infected.
The name hepatitis is a collective name for infections caused by various viruses.
Their symptoms have many similarities, characterized by inflammation of the liver and jaundice, but their pathogens and diseases are different.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (semen, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should definitely be vaccinated against virus A and B, and there is no vaccine against C.
Hepatitis A symptoms occur two to three weeks after exposure to the infected food, with general malaise, weakness, abdominal complaints, nausea.
After this, jaundice on the skin and white eyes occurs, faeces becomes clear, urine becomes dark, healing can take two to three weeks.
One million people worldwide die of a more severe type of disease, liver cancer caused by hepatitis B and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth infected receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to liver shrinkage and liver cancer.
Most of the infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogen is subversely destroying liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms occur in 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention and regular screening tests are very important.
In three groups, there are far more than average cases: people who had had transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
There are currently 200 million people in the world infected with chronic hepatitis C virus.
As the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended to seek medical advice when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
When the disease can be cured in time, the virus can be eradicated from the body so that the infection ceases and the cancer can be prevented.
30 September is the World Day of Hepatitis, which was first held in 2004 by the organisations representing patients around the world.
It aims to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Is it less painful to believe in God?
According to a recent research, religious faith acts as a kind of painkiller that could have made the death of Catholic martyrs easier.
The scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment, investigating how belief affects people's sense of pain, and the British Telegraph has announced it.
In the context of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were electrocuted, while they all studied a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to rule out most of the pain.
Thanks to the scanning technique of the human brain, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain responsible for controlling pain.
The investigation is the first in a series of research in which academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians, are involved from different parts of the university.
The investigation was done precisely by adding a sparkling device to the left hand of the test subject, which provided the electroshock.
Researchers asked those involved in the experiment to look closely at two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted by Sassaferrato in the 17th century and Leonardo da Vinci in the 15th century, painted with Lady Hermelin.
The makers of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would bring about a religious state among believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and it was considered to be soothing.
Experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electroshock in four consecutive parts, while either looking at the religious theme or the general picture.
Catholics have reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary they felt "safe" as they were "taken care of" and "calmed down, filled with peace."
While looking at the image of the religious theme, there were 12 percent less pain reported than when Leonardo's work was seen before you.
A psychologist named Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the investigation, believes that similar effects can be achieved with any powerful image, with atheists, only the right photo.
"We should find a picture of someone they feel very positive for, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Bishop Tom Wright of England welcomed the results of his research.
"The practice of faith should and in many cases will change our personality," said Wright.
After the great results, the question is, if Leonardo or a painter of the same caliber showed any of the madonna to the believers, what would that have to do with their pain control?
Would the sight of the quality of the Virgin Mary mean even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can tell you that in people's pockets you can find it as much as over their heads in the sky; you know where they were on vacation, what specialities they were taking and what they were interested in.
And that's still not enough, according to one of the company's top men.
As far as skeptics that are parallel to the Orwellian terror picture are concerned, they don't see the very essence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently declared to Financial Times that Google's main goal was to collect more personal data on their users, and that is necessary to keep themselves to the original goal of Google Founders, which sounded like "let's get all the information in the world."
According to the Google leader, even after ten years of world subversive work, the company is only at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
The question of what would happen in five years, Schmidt answered: he wanted Google to be able to answer questions like "What do I do tomorrow?" or "What kind of work would really fit me?" - but until then, the software would not be able to answer such simple questions because they do not know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that search words are precisely recorded during internet searches, from what IP address they were looking for and to which page the interested persons left after the search.
Through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own surfing background history, look back at what they were looking for, by clicking on it, and by doing so, will generate more personalised hits for them in the long term - the same logic will be based on the Recommentations, which will offer us products and services based on our earlier and recorded preferences.
"What if you use my data against me when you look at what I do?" asks the users, who are concerned about seeing Google's data monopolies.
In most cases, the extent of potential power represented by the company may be scary, not guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom, or even rebellion against power, which is causing counter-reactions in Internet users.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only recorded, but may, where appropriate, be handed over to third parties, in such cases there is nothing to protect the privacy of Internet users.
The most loud example of this has perhaps been the coordinated action against the Brazilian paedophiles, in which Google provided the Brazilian government with information on pedophiles from the Community side of Orkut, which it maintains.
However, Internet users concerned with privacy rights could sigh up in May when the company successfully proved its truth in court against the FBI in conjunction with the EFF electronic protection organisation, which means that Google cannot later be forced to supply any information requested by the FBI in secret with any of the articles of the Constitution.
(At the same time, the Federal Government successfully fought out some 50,000 web addresses and thousands of search phrases, which it obtained by referring to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act adopted years ago, but failed to obtain the search lists of individual users and to obtain a full web and keyword list covering two months).
Google is therefore quite contradictory in its assessment: it is besieged by those who fear to give their personal data, because they feel that their privacy and privacy are being damaged by the start of Google's services and the emergence of rebellion against them by the multicles that shine in conservative image.
In the meantime, the American geek culture and its wild pursuit of many countries, which brings together keen computer fans, activists, users, sees in them the next generation of large companies, the "cool corruption", unlike its rival Microsoft, who has been world conquerors for Windows, no matter how much they both fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not ask its users for identification codes in a way other than Microsoft, it does not ask for money for applications, the open, free, constantly updated source code and program package can be much more accessible, younger, cooler than the official software giant's practice.
However, it can also be because the geecs can precisely see the very problematic relationship between personality rights and the Internet, which has been followed by a key word that has been spoken most frequently in recent years, web 2.0.
The web 2.0 is about nothing more than collaboration, about deliberately leaving clues behind and using the communication channels at our disposal, and while they vary by individuals, the point is to show ourselves.
An average young person can lead profiles from Facebook to Xanga on several social media sites, connect them to other services such as Twitter, or the last.fm that lists his music habits, and then connect them to tracking systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and also drive a blog where they automatically appear in their latest photo galleries, which are stored on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read about several examples of cases that reveal that the girlfriend can easily discover the morning picture of the group of friends, seeing who her cheating friend spent the evening with or can fire a company employee just because she writes her honest opinion on the top management in her blog: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has been fully revalued by now.
For those of you who live online, what you show yourself is what we can use to define the basic principle behind the behavior of young people today.
And if you want to hide something, or at least you want to avoid Google monopolies, you can do it (starting with Scroogle using Google's search system, for example, but not leaving a trace on purpose).
For example, the number of people who do not intend to register on social sites so that they can not be found can be replaced by alternative versions of Google's online applications from text editor to image manager and news reader, which are not connected to huge server parks and which do not put together the best profile that we have ever had.
Public opinion isn't so secret when Google shows its teeth protein.
With its current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), AdWords / AdSense advertising platforms threaten advertising agencies' revenues, and the services introduced at an ever-increasing pace cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft, but also to many other software developers.
However, critical spectators also find these disturbing opponents: for example, the senior management has completely rejected employees' objections, after increasing the cost of the company's kindergarten fee double, the management has found it too costly to eat employees more than once a day, but it is all fading away in addition to the fact that Google bowed back to the Chinese Government in 2006 and, according to their agreement, the company will eliminate any hits that undermine good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that no new service will be advertised until it can be used, but it is certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years can move the world at another point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine scanning and archiving project is of such size that the company will soon have to face the US Supreme Court, others are terrified of the Health system, in which we can build a full health profile with our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database can also provide good material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the popular story of Cory Doctorow, Scroogled points in orwelli, describes the future in which a person can only be alarmingly approached from Google data.
Two minors helped the Odd double murderer with the eraser.
"Two young men were questioned by the police in the case of the Ozdi double murder," said the spokesman of the Borsod County Police Department on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged their burden, and are now accused of aiding and abetting.
The two minors, according to MTI's information, have two girls on the loose.
Accidents can be punished by imprisonment for up to five years.
The suspect in the OCT double homicide, a 23-year-old local man, was arrested on Sunday.
Premeditated, wanted for profit, charged with the murder of several people.
The investigation revealed that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect refused to settle his debt, so last Wednesday, he lured his creditor to an Odd settlement where he killed him, and then his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was premeditated to commit the crime, indicating that he committed the murder with a concealed weapon at the scene.
The weapons and conditions of use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of an expert.
Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kroner - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange to purchase the 100% stock package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Ludwik Sobolewski confirmed the offer, which was made by Poles despite the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange was previously excluded by the Czechs from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in state hands.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State, which intends to sell more than 60% of the papers in a few months.
The new Czech economic newspaper E15 knows that the Polish offer is the highest amount that the interested parties have so far offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech newspapers, so far, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, New York Stock Exchange, London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, chief of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner, and did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated at 5-10 billion kroner.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90% of the papers could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance investment bank with a 25% stake, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna bank by 14,7% and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. 13,5%.
On the financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
The European papers leading up to the ever-deepening international financial crisis in their Tuesday comments refer to the 'second September 11'.
The global financial disaster is due to the President of the United States - the Roman La Repubblica accuses us - the President has not even been able to put his own party on the line behind the bill, which, in haste, is designed to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, it is more appropriate to talk about September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press see the scapegoat in Washington.
In El Mundo's view, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and the whole world will suffer.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, the congressional vote threatens Washington to offer no political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism takes place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - points to the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Today, some states can provide rescue belts to attacking financial institutions, and with taxpayers' money, they can save them from bankruptcy.
However, if more banks collapse like dominoes, neither funds nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to go beyond their national selfishness and centralise control over the fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was received by the Infirmary Financial Institutions - the Vienna Der Standard recalls that the concern that European taxpayers, like Americans, must reach deep into their pockets to remedy the crisis is becoming more realistic.
So far, the EU has not been seriously concerned with the crisis, which sweeps through the old continent like tsunami.
An 'ambulance' does not have to fly nearly EUR 100 billion, but it would be good to record: in which case it is reasonable to touch taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
The trance of the trance is imitated by the intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop technologies to avoid collision if not to imitate obstacle sensors in the world of nature?
Bees, for example.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebee bees gave Nissan's engineers the strategic idea of how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C Biotope Control System, a robotic minivan, which was provided with the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all collisions.
During the flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is in fact very similar to our safety barrier, explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, technological PR and research and development brand director.
An important role is the complex eye of the uterus, which can see in every direction at a angle of more than 300 degrees.
In order to copy the function of the composite eye, engineers touched the idea of a laser telemetry.
This will identify obstacles, calculate their distance and send a signal to the on-board microprocessor in a 180-degree field of vision before the BR23C, which will immediately transform into an operation to avoid impact.
Within a fraction of a second, the barrier is detected, and then the auto-box, mimicking the movements of the uterus, immediately changes direction by turning its wheels to the extent necessary to avoid impact.
In any way other than the current system, this evasive maneuver is conducted in a fully intuitive manner.
"If this were not so, the car robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the Mobility Laboratory and the driver of the auto-robot project.
It must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety barrier, a layer within which impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does in order to avoid other bees.
This process must take place in an instant.
However, in a way other than bees, the discrepancy must not be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, only two-dimensional and only in the direction of wheel inversion.
Thus, instead of the infinite possibility available to bees to avoid other bees, only rotation and acceleration and deceleration have been used as an option available for the auto-box.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, which means they have a longer life span than lithium-ion.
Andoh says that a instinctive intelligent response is important, not the ability to process data, even less store them.
This device must process and respond to only a few input signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and respond to intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers, so it only uses a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
There's no need for gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step in the development of instant bypass technology that Nissan estimates can enter serial-made cars within 10 years.
An additional application may be possible to combine the unit with the GPS-satellite navigation system in order to lead the car to the specified end-destination by avoiding obstacles on the road.
It's got a name for the expensive kid.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law for the purchase of banks' bad loans has been completed.
They spend half the amount in the first round.
At the time of the east coast, during the further talks until after midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders reached a conclusion in the debate around a total of $700 billion rescue package for days, said Reuters.
"We have made serious progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, who said that only the agreement had to be put on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson has stated that the programme will work and will be effective, but there must be more to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about reversing the economic wagon.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets in Washington on Sunday evening at 8: 00 p.m. (i.e. Monday morning at 2: 00 p.m. Central European time), but did not cause a spectacular uppercut in the prison.
The draft legislation on the programme, which is entitled the 2008 Economic Emergency Stabilization Act, will be voted on by the House of Representatives first on Monday and then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are pleased with the progress made last night and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our financial markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, spokesman for the White House.
Moreover, the programme differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which would have meant that the $700 billion would have been spent on the purchase of bad-quality, credit-backed securities.
In the first round, up to half of the sum of 700 billion can be spent immediately after Congress is expected to vote on the matter on Monday, of which the Ministry of Finance buys bad-credit securities, and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the President.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, which will include the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on another decision by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance can use a combined tactic: it can purchase bad loans, mortgages and mortgage-backed securities at the same time and other types of "toxic" loans.
The purchase may take place in auctions and directly - it has been notified by the Ministry's authorities.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme where the financial wallet guarantees assets of concern for which the companies will pay a fee corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the necessary means of obtaining up to $700 billion for the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the widespread purchase of bad assets, whether it is their insurance or the avoidance of systemic risk associated with the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law as soon as it is signed, he added.
However, the bosses of banks in distress and waiting for state help can expect the government to limit their withdrawal money, which the overseas slang simply calls a gold parachute.
Payments are limited only in certain cases, and the limits depend on how the Ministry of Finance helps.
In essence, the restriction means that if the Ministry buys at auction, an additional tax will be levied on the gold parachute, unless they retire the reduced bank leader.
When purchasing bad loans directly, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that management money is not excessive.
The picture includes the fact that existing gold parachute contracts are not changed, the restriction applies only to new ones, so as to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first time in American history that there will be legal restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs, commented on the measure by the President of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives, Barney Frank, the Democratic Party.
In addition, in the banks involved in the scheme, the State obtains the right to acquire a share and thus the risk of taxpayers is reduced, since they can ultimately win the transaction as soon as the economy and the bank that has been saved recover.
The bill states that for the next five years, the President will have to submit to Congress a proposal providing for the return of the expected losses to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their doubts about the plan.
"This is not what the American citizens have asked us to do, which means that it does not protect the taxpayers' dollars," said the Republican Congressman Darrell Issa, California.
His Democratic colleague, Mary Kaptur, of Ohio, believed that the measures were encouraged by the same people who were responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased by 0,1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12,9% in comparison with August 2007, which is reported by KSH.
The prices of industrial export sales were 1.1% higher than in July 2008 and 3,9% lower than before one year.
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial producer prices were 0.7% higher than the previous month and 3.2% higher than the one year earlier.
The domestic sales prices of the industry increased only to a minimum by 0,1% compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly by 0,1% compared to July.
The highest price increase occurred in August 2008 in the leather product and footwear manufacturing sector (2.8%), mainly due to an increase of 4,6% in the production of bags and straps and 2,5% in the monthly price increase in footwear production.
The higher price levels of plastic and chemical raw materials have resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical, product and industry (1.6%).
There has been a decrease in the production of crude oil (1,4%), electrical machinery, instruments (0.9%) and, to a minimum, wood processing (0,1%) sectors.
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing have not changed.
In the other processing sectors, we measured an increase in prices between 0.2% and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water sector, which represents a significant weight in domestic sales of industry, prices increased by 0,3% in August, mainly due to the excessive impact of the official gas price increase from 1 July.
In a comparison of 12 months, prices increased to the greatest extent in the oil processing sector (32,4%) as regards domestic sales of the processing industry.
The production of metal products has shown an increase of 13,2% in the sector of food, drink and tobacco production, representing a dominant weight, by 11%.
The price decrease occurred in the sectors of textiles, textile products (2,5%) and electrical machinery and apparatus (0,3%).
In the other processing sectors, the rate of price increase was between 0,6% and 9.1%.

In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured an increase of 6,8% in prices and a decrease of 1,4% in investment prices.
The export sales prices of the industry in forint increased by 1,1% in August compared to the previous month and decreased by 3,9% in 12 monthly comparisons.
In one month, our domestic currency declined by 1.7% compared to the euro, by 7.1% compared to the dollar, by 7.5% compared to the euro in August 2007 and 15.9% in relation to the dollar.
Don't you need a visa to the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance that the US-Hungarian visa waiver agreement will enter into force around 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago in front of the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, "now almost everything depends on whether or not the electronic access and control system is being established overseas in time."
However, it pointed out that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
He is meeting with the Foreign Minister Condoleezza Rice, to whom the Central Cross of the Hungarian Republic Medal of Medal of Medal of Medal of Honor with the Star, and is conducting meetings with the foreign policy advisors of Democratic Party Barack Obama and Republican candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are standing next to the bank rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidate of the two great American parties, gave support to the government's $700 billion bank aid package on Sunday, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
After days of negotiations between Congress and the administration in Marathon, the representatives of Congress and the administration announced at dawn on Sunday: an agreement in principle on the bank rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial package to melt the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain say they're better suited than their competitors to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, with the economic issues first, Obama again gained some advantage, melted the advantage of McCain, which, after the Republican convention, was nominated as Vice President of Sarah Palin.
Obama at a campaign meeting in Detroit on Sunday expressed hope that the 700 billion-dollar package bill would be passed quickly by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection passes that he supported.
"We must act now, with responsibility (...) in the face of your position, your savings, the entire industries, the stability of the entire economy," he said in front of the 35,000 people.
He didn't miss calling McCain's economic vision outdated.
McCain explained in his interview with ABC, "this will be difficult for all of us to swallow... but doing nothing is simply not an option."
The Republican Senator told us that the proposal included the establishment of the Finance Minister's supervisory board and the limitation of the severance pay of top executives, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no meaningful role in the negotiations, but he was in daily contact with the Minister.
On Sunday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives will hopefully vote on the bill by Monday.
View of the German language area
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the voters become more conscious - this is how Der Spiegel analyses the weak presence of CSU in Bavaria.
The Haiders are ready to steer Austria to prevent red and black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German newspaper on the left, Franz Walter, the revolution in Bavaria, is devouring his birth fathers, analyzing the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the known politician, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Duo Beckstein-Huber took over his office.
Christian socialists have renewed Bavaria for decades - and these are the modern citizens who are now turning away from them.
The change of era is also a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, including Angela Merkel.
The failure was not quite surprising to the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely almost ten years ago: the undisputed hegemony of a party of state ceased.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the '50s below 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, so it was still mentioned in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consistently implemented modernisation by CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong at the pace. However, there could not have been no consequence of secularisation, educational results, the introduction of Eastern and North Germans into the developing regions of Bavaria.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences are also visible.
The right-wing camp is intact, only within the camp have the voters become more conscious, more critical, more self-centered.
It is also noticeable that, in recent weeks, the classic civil groups are the most distant from the CSU; they are free workers, industrialists, graduates and senior graduates.
Here, the support of CSU has been reduced to 40 percent.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Vienna Day article entitled "Who, who? The Party Presidents on Coalition issues for Restraints" deals with the confused internal policy situation following the Austrian elections.
SPÖG wishes to negotiate with ÖVP.
ÖVP forbids SPÖG's interference in domestic affairs.
The BZE is open to negotiations in all directions, and the Greens do not want to discuss coalition.
The election has taken place, and everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders barely allowed access to their cards.
President Werner Faymann SPÖG has confirmed his intention to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖs wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in some provinces and in the social partnership.
The question of whether you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP President, as an alchemist, was left open by Faymann.
As you said, the Schüssel-Molterer course was voted down anyway.
Repetition of this direction is not an issue.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red offers.
As you said, cooperation will certainly not be effective if Faymann attempts to intervene in ÖVP's internal affairs.
Whether your party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is open to the moment, the questions must be discussed within ÖVP.
President Jörg Haider BZÖG has once again shown open in all directions.
"To prevent red and black coalition, we are ready to assume government responsibility," said Haider.
Walkers: Break the diabolical circle of poverty, segregation
Today, the European Equal Opportunities Summit in Paris was held by France, representing the Presidency-in-Office of the European Union.
Lívia Járóka, the Fidesse Member of the European People's Party, pointed out in his message to the parish as one of the main speakers of the professional congress, that this is one of the most serious violations of the Roma children and, moreover, that is the most serious obstacle to their enforcement.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, European social partners and the most important European legal protection and civil society organisations in the area of equal opportunities were invited to take part in the deliberations.
According to the press office of the EP Group of Fidesz, Járóka warned that, in addition to discrimination in recruitment, the Roma are primarily excluded from the labour market due to their low education.
"The vast majority of Roma young people have no secondary education, and due to low-quality primary education, only a minor part of them can obtain higher education."
Járóka also stressed that, as a fundamental human right, education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights.
Investment in early education for Roma children could mean strengthening the economy of the European Union Member States.
According to the Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these relations in the widest sense, including between Roma and non-Roma.
As soon as Roma students start school, they will increase their chances of becoming productive members of the labour market; they will contribute to the national budget through taxes paid for income and consumption.
"Roma must have the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their low quality and separate education," said Livia Járóka.
According to the Member, the European Union's objective and action-oriented coordination is necessary to speed up school desegregation processes immediately, and it is essential to ensure that existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly complied with.
"The diabolical circle of poverty, segregation, unemployment must be broken, the Roma children must be given the opportunity to contribute to the future of Europe as a full citizen," said Járóka.
In the spirit of the European Year of Equal Opportunities for all, the European Equal Opportunities Summit, which has been held every year since the meeting in Berlin last year, aims to provide a unique forum for promoting the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: Grace for a transitional period
At the end of October, they decide on the fate of the lost Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the mockery of the election failure, heads have not fallen yet; at the peak of the Bavarian CSU, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed.
The PM Erwin Huber and the Provincial Prime Minister of Günther Beckstein can remain in place, and the question is, how long will the grace last?
The fate of the 17% catastrophic vote-loss tandem will be decided on the last weekend of October by an extraordinary party congress.
In any case, the members of the many criticised couples have perceived that they do not hold on to their chairs with all their might.
This was their attempt to calm down the angry members of the faction and the base, who, one day after the Bavarian tsunami, demanded personal conclusions for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, with Edmund Stoiber on top of his career - the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, it was only 43,4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU has been a "single ruler 'in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
Although conservatives are still very important for the Hungarian economy in the southern region, they will be forced to coalition in the future.
As a first sign of reorganisation within the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer and Federal Minister for Agriculture, who is the potential successor to Huber, will also be present in the narrow search team that will start the negotiations on a possible Munich government coalition with the Liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Choice.
The funny thing about being on the list of Free Elections is that Gabriele Pauli, whose actions against Stoiber were taken as a coup d'état by Huber-Beckstein, and then mistakenly treated by the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now using all their energy to stabilize Beckstein somehow.
The transition will also play an active role in Stoiber, which has so far been a backdrop, calling it the worst day of September 28th of the political career of the former Provincial Prime Minister and former CSU President.
Huber made some epic comments to the CDU on Monday, and he thought they deserved a lot more support from the sibling party.
Other CSU politicians understood defeat as a warning to both CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel cannot be Chancellor if the CSU, which played a significant role in national success in 2005, is not somehow recovered by joint force.
According to Merkel, which is difficult to cover his disappointment because of the fiasco, CSU's loss of soil will not have a negative impact on the Berlin coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easier to deal with, and the crisis of social democrats will continue.
SPD achieved 18,6% of its weakest results in Bavaria since 1946.
Opposition Lukashenko: 110-0
No opposition Member has made it to the Belarusian Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, this can be explained by the welfare and stability provided in the country led by Aleksandr Lukashenko, but according to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the lawlessness committed at the time of the counting of votes.
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
Although the legislative process of the 10 million country has been lacking the opposition for a large decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, called the United Democratic Forces (ODS), was seriously hoping that Lukashenko, which, following the amendment of the Constitution, renewed his mandate four times in the elections of controversial purity in 2006, would "allow" some opposition representatives to appear in Parliament.
The ODS has therefore also stopped the pre-weighed boycott.
On the background of the opposition expectations, Belarus, which has been increasingly dependent on Russia, which has taken credit for the reduction of continuously expensive Russian imports of natural gas and has also contributed to the Russian hand of Beltransgaz, who owns gas pipelines across the country, wanted to improve its relationship with the EU, where Lukashenko and several high-ranking politicians do not receive travel permits due to the anti-democratic Belarusian political arrangement.
In advance, it referred to relief that the OSCE, when assessing the election campaign, focused on positive movements rather than on deficiencies such as the ban of a third of opposition candidates from departure.
However, the OSCE rapid report on Monday has already objected to the campaign - in which opposition candidates could not essentially appear in the press - and in particular to the fact that the opposition could not be present at the counting of votes.
However, according to the opposition, there is still an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to have a smaller confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which has been separated from Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus is a federal state on paper, has been independent for a month now.
"We have taken two steps forward, one step back, but most importantly, the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," said Aleksandr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this should remain, despite the fact that 'power is frightened of letting even one of its opponents into the weightless parliament'.
The opposition does not plan any protest actions in view of the results, but rather seeks to deliver its message of the need for economic reforms to the electorate.
'Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, and local authorities are putting obstacles to the distribution, but I can see that more and more people are supporting change, including among the elderly, 'said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which regards the creation of social security as a major achievement, is not even considered appropriate by the group of the most officially supported pensioners.
"The debt of the country, because of the increase in the trade deficit," said Milinkevich, "is a matter of time before the social security break of the 'silence of the cemetery'.
In contrast to opposition politicians, Russian observers have considered the elections to be democratic.
Sergey Lebedev, leading the mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian intelligence agency in Ria Novosyi: "people believe not the words but the deeds," so the absence of the opposition is proof of the maturity of the Belarusian electorate.
Brunetta: "Breakfast only before working hours"
In the history of the Chigi Palace, a unique revolving door was installed to get workers in and out.
From this day on, this new measure will take effect against the skillful people, to filter out those who block and then go out for coffee at work.
The anti-solar novelty was presented today by Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Mauro Masi, Secretary-General of the Prime Minister's Office.
"The revolving gates," said Brunetta, are for better and more efficient work, reducing deficits and increasing services. "
"There will be a new, more responsible and more transparent period.
This is the real reform, "stressed Brunetta.
The Chigi Palace will complete the installation of all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, "installation of revolving gates is also of symbolic importance."
We have not seen any resistance from the staff, the Secretary-General confirmed: "The workers have approved the measure, everyone has cooperated."
So, breakfast's over at work, no more coffee, no more brioche.
Brunetta, smiling, advises, "A good cappuccino at 7: 00 in the morning, can do wonders."
At the Rome College of Public Administration
At a meeting held, the Minister explained: "In three months, there was a 50% reduction in public sector deficit due to disease, which means 60 000 more workers in one year."
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more effective
"which, according to the Minister, has been twice the size of the private sector in the last eight to ten years and has been well above the inflation rate."
At the same time, thousands of civil servants gathered together, joining the petition supported by the Italian Association for the Environment and Consumer Protection to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulation.
"While the Minister of Administration boasts data supporting the reduction of disease deficiencies, the 'tireless loafers' army is constantly growing, 'says the consumer protection association.
Throughout Italy, thousands of honest and hard-working administrative employees have gathered to declare war on the illegal regulations of the regulation. "
The Regional Administrative Court shall, inter alia, challenge the abolition of supplementary sickness benefits, the extension of the residence time of workers on sick leave, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and several other aspects of the new provisions provided for by the Minister.
Accidents at work: Napolitano says prevention is of all importance
In Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work every day, of which 3 end in death and 27 end in permanent invalidity.
According to data from the accident insurance company at work, nearly 1,200 deaths occurred at the workplace in 2007.
The figures show the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death today and requires almost twice as much sacrifice as murder.
Today, for the 58th time, Anmil is hosting the day of the victims of accidents at work, traditionally held on the second Sunday of October, in all the counties of Italy, to draw the attention of the institutions, social organisations and mass communication to this dramatic problem.
"The worrying data provided by Anmil and the tragic events of recent days show that prevention in accidents at work has an extremely important role," said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to Pietro Mercandelli, the President of the National Association of Accident at Work.
The head of state sincerely commended the 'association's persistent commitment to prevention at work, to the protection of the interests of workers in accidents, to help victims' families and to making public opinion '.
"Natural and honestly divided outrage is caused by these kinds of tragedies, which, by their size, also attract the interest of the media and the public, but in reality, we have to face dramatic, repeated and repeated cases every day."
Napolitano openly admits: 'There is no doubt a shortage of resources, funding education and information is crucial.
Intra-school initiatives aimed at direct education of young people on the verge of entering the world of work are of paramount importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in this phenomenon, not to ignore the social importance of this issue, and we need more effective legislation to enforce it.
The President of the Lower House, Gianfranco Fini, stressed for his part, "how serious accidents at work end in death are of social importance to all of us, and they require the institutions to put an end to this as soon as possible."
"Data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this type is still extremely high," said Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Anmil.
"At the same time, we do not want this downward trend to be combined with decreasing attention, because the biggest tragedies are happening when attention falls."
"We believe that, at a general level, we are still not doing everything we can to combat this phenomenon, which could be resolved through a complex action programme.
In our opinion, more stringent supervision and control would be needed, said Mercandelli, and a stronger intervention in the field of labour training, starting from school education. '
"Further efforts are needed to inform and secure public opinion," he added.
What is most needed, however, is a more responsible employer environment in relation to a phenomenon that is a problem at social level. '
Then Mercandelli criticised "the gradual deterioration of the protection net for victims of accidents at work 'and" aid policy towards which the system has been drifting in recent years'.
"The aim is therefore to give the workers back the security provided by the insurance, because the fate of those who suffer from the accident cannot depend on the arbitrary measures of legislators, and on their distribution."
Hearing damage can be caused by MP3 players
May cause permanent hearing damage by listening to portable player devices for longer periods of time and high volume, such as MP3 devices -
in its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, on the basis of the opinion published today by the EU Scientific Committee on New and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR).
"The opinion shows that 5-10 percent of people who listen to their portable music player for more than one hour per day for five years can suffer hearing damage."
"It is worrying that young people who use portable music players and mobile phones that operate on a high volume of sound often are not aware of their irreversible potential to damage their hearing," said Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific surveys indicate an undisputed risk, which we urgently need to respond to," said the Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information about them widely.
In the light of that opinion, we also need to review existing control systems so that they can operate effectively and keep up with the latest technologies. '
Brussels asked the independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem in view of the prevalence of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise damage.
The European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures that could be taken to protect children and minors exposed to noise caused by portable players and similar devices, "said the member of the committee.
The current European safety standard sets out 100 dB maximum noise levels for portable music players, but there is an increasing concern about hearing damage caused by excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing the level and duration of noise pollution by which these hearing damage can be significantly reduced.
In the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee, it explains that when using a portable player device with a high volume of music (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week, noise pollution exceeds the current maximum noise level at work.
If you listen to music for a longer period of time in similar circumstances, there is a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10% of the users of portable equipment, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will set up a committee responsible for the future of the capital
It starts today, it lasts until March, the results can be expected in June.
This is the timetable set by the Capital Government for the operation of the "future of the capital of Rome" committee, which met this morning at the new headquarters behind the baths of Caracalla.
For the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up Rome's guidelines.
After the final date of March, the study and plans will be evaluated in the General Assembly and in the municipal committee, in order to be able to submit a strategic plan officially approved by the Municipality and Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"This is a completely independent committee in which all kinds of political, social and cultural ideas are represented," emphasized Alemanno, "and its task is to develop proposals on the development ideas of Rome that political decision-makers, namely the General Assembly and the Committee on Local Government, can rely on.
There is no conflict of competence. We just wanted a platform where big plans for the benefit of Rome could be made.
In March, after he has completed his duties, the committee will be dissolved because he has a term of office.
In June, we presented a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee on the Future of Rome's capital, said the Mayor General.
For those of you who consider the Commission to be redundant, on the grounds that the opinion he has put forward is not binding, Alemanno replied: "Everything depends on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals will be put on the table.
If the standards prove appropriate, as will the Attali Commission in France, which I am sure of in the case of Rome, the contribution it has given will play an important role.
The power of policy is often fragmented in the management of daily affairs and in the management of urgent cases from time to time.
On the other hand, we, taking into account the perspective, look further and plan for a longer term, and we are committed to the development and future of Rome. "
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that "this Commission cannot be considered as a useless' water head ', because it is absolutely free, it will not cost any euro to Roman citizens, but it will serve as an incentive to think and aim to involve the finest minds in the capital.'
Alemanno says that "we need an open-ended and flexible strategic framework that allows our city to jump to the level that it needs in a single spirit to think about its future."
The future on which the mayor of Rome underlines: 'he will not only be limited to the current municipal framework but will look far further', we see not only the future metropolis and the metropolis status, but also 'the role that Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean can play as capital cities and must be filled'.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known, independent American politician wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, with his decisions, destroyed the American economy and had close relations with the enemy Islam (as he does today as a private person). "
As the election date approaches, the attacks on Obama are getting more frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet, "This man is full of ambition.
Obama bravely believes that he can win the highest public dignity of a nation that has so far had two governors and five senators black! "
These attacks are actually meaningless; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the question of whether or not the voters will be a good president, and then there are public opinion polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and they will have a significant superiority.
In this case, there are people who listen to their feelings, not their brains.
Inside the southern states, a newspaper in Mississippi wrote this in its editorial: we know very well that the real American patriot in the voting cabinet will cast his vote on whom.
A side of American thinking appears here that remains hidden until the last moment.
"Just talk what you want, and we'll know where to put the eggs, Obama or McCain."
Some people swear that if Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
Such words have never been spoken until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all these wisecracks, the Democrats have a winning weapon, George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked about the mistakes made during Bush's term of office? 89% said Iraq.
America is changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and they kicked it so hard it flew home.
4500 soldiers died in Iraq, and the Americans didn't have to pack.
Yet the majority believe that Iraq was Bush's weakness.
It's a huge task for anyone who takes George W. 's place.
USA: the economic collapse has already been felt by journalists, the time has come for cuts in editors. Many blame the Internet for the "death" of the printed press.
The PEW Research Institute has asked 500 American journalists how they feel about the future situation and the spiritual power of their profession.
Well, at this point, almost every journalist is a pessimist about his own future.
However, it was not clearly claimed that their concerns had been reduced in terms of credibility.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to be.
The problem of American journalists is money.
They believe the crisis in 2008 is the failure of a weak economic model.
There is also a serious problem with the restrictions on newsroom, which is newspaper-making editors.
If we do not want traditional journalism to be reduced to a minimum, this problem must be solved, "says the journalists who have been asked.
Today, there is a visible and complex pessimism of American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in printed press are convinced that national journalism is on the wrong track.
At local level, 65% of journalists are in senior management positions.
Printed versus electronic press.
The press staff will have no difficulty seeing where the world's web is going.
The biggest publishers make their way to the Internet, which many believe to be the "killer" of the printed press.
The "economic pressure" perceived by journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists who have been questioned have admitted that they will vote in favour of technology in the hope that it may benefit from mischief.
Today, in the American press industry, there is a gap between the editorial leaders, the directors, and the reporters working for them.
At national level, 56% of the leaders are sure that their correspondents share their information with others, while at local level, this ratio is only 23%.
Some people connect that to a certain job.
At national level, 47% of the leaders are afraid of losing their jobs within three years.
In the case of journalists, this rate is 30%.
In America, the issue of "sure work" is on the agenda at team level (for our editors, etc.).
Only 13% of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a large nation such as the United States with 300 million inhabitants, where thousands of newspapers, journals, radio, television and Internet service providers operate, employers usually offer as much as they want, so the thing works on a "must or should not" basis.
Directors usually get high salaries and editors can make $10,000 a month, in addition to the pension and health insurance fee.
Freedom, on the other hand, is a rather complicated principle: in the first year x day, in the third year, as well, until it reaches a maximum of 15 days after a certain time.
But American journalists, according to their own admission, often "get sick" during the year.
Everything depends on the climate.
THE COURT OF ROMA: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATA
Carmelo Rinaudo, president of the second branch of the Roman Court of Justice, rejected Danilo Coppola's application to move from his place of residence, Grottferrata, to a Roman apartment.
Coppola is under investigation for economic bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the Unipol-BNL share exchange agreement.
Last week, during the proceedings against him, house arrest was lifted and changed to a residence ban for Grottferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, have requested that the real estate professional enter the capital apartment of the rural town.
However, according to the court, these commutes (for which the prosecutor has made a negative proposal) would allow the company to influence its affairs and to have access to the evidence against it.
In danger of the elite
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote in favour of the 700 billion dollar rescue package presented by the White House: much of the Americans were more interested and still interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also supported by yesterday's New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis has caused a break in the Republican Party, which shows an ever-increasing division between the traditional, moderate, Eastern-Coast attitude to support federal institutions and business circles and the ever-increasing new anti-Washington and Financial World line in the Central and South States.
This line was expressed in a critical way during the vote in the House referred to in the introduction.
However, this event is only one of the major changes that economic restructuring still taking place indicates or allows us to see, and not only in the United States, but also in the entire Western world, and perhaps beyond.
It seems that the crisis, both in the US and in Europe, will only speed up the long-standing phenomena that have been solidifying in this new climate and will finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-updating, the renationalisation of the dual category of state sovereignty into public consciousness, a sort of renationalisation of the economy.
The crisis concerns banking and financial institutions which, although they have close links with the rest of the world, are, first and foremost, and quite widely, bringing with them people and families that live in a single country, in a single state.
This is, however, a direct political difficulty for those in the government: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people who are also electorate.
Therefore, the crisis appears to be global in economic terms, but it is almost exclusively national in political terms.
It appears that political internationalism is essentially off the coast: the European Union, which, lagging between different interests and different national strategies, is not able to set a single political line.
Thus, everyone expects the intervention, the rescue package, the recovery and the new rules, but most of all, the opening up of funds: because, in times of crisis, only individual states have economic resources, financial resources that can make things right.
They also have the means and the authority to use them: under certain circumstances they have two invaluable resources that no other market and no international organisation will ever have in this way.
Moreover, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on national statehood is fully in line with the fact that the economic growth that has taken place recently attaches to an increasing importance that is closely linked to this element: this is territorial.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the abstract world of increasingly sophisticated technology, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to rule the world, we suddenly had to realise that our future depended more and more on things such as water, crop and oil.
Things that can be transported from one side of the planet to another, but they can be completely linked to a demarcated place, an area.
So whoever controls the area has a lot more cards than one who, unfortunately, was born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also like to turn to the second novelty, which suggests a sort of fault line.
Anyone who says "territory, state, government," necessarily says "politics," in other words, "driving."
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two conflicting phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition of the need for credible leadership, someone who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, especially economic leaders, has resulted in a total loss of faith, who have proved to be completely inadequate and have proved that many of them still have a vague area ahead of them.
Together, the two are even deeper and more disturbing in a sense: the loss of faith, impatience, incompetence and isolation, which affects the entire leadership elite in more and more Western countries.
So it seems that there is a growing belief in the wider population that the time of the social elite at its peak has expired. It expired before their actions, experiences, ways of life, culture, in the complex sense of the word, they became self-absorbed, thus making the social elite increasingly alienated from the opinion of the majority.
In other words, the need for leadership, in its veiled form, provides a broad but strong delegation movement against the ruling class and the traditional political system. This manifests itself in the unexpected "revolts" of voters, or in the recent sudden changes in the public mood. Such as the conservatives' access to power in Austria and Bavaria, the collapse of the Labour Party unit in Great Britain, or the rebellion of US congressmen against Bush (and perhaps even the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, along with their parties, programmes, and even their customs, press and notable intellect, seem to understand less and less and less and less what has been happening for some time in the deeper layers of Western society. Furthermore, the economic crisis is growing, spreading and potentially capable of creating more and less passion.
In spite of all this, talking about the impending rebellion of the masses would, frankly, be excessive.
But it doesn't hurt to keep your eyes open.
We can walk on the wall with super-strong glue
With the help of a super-powerful glue to overcome gravity and walk on the wall like Spider-Man.
This is the goal that several American research centres and a group of four institutions have set themselves close to the solution.
With a mere 2.5 square centimeters of glue, researchers managed to attach a 100-pound body to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American Journal of Science published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the scientific group has already been produced from the further development of existing special carbon nanotope materials.
"The principle of adhesive operation must be seen as a set of tubes similar to spaghetti," says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Researchers drew the idea from the foot covered with gecko microscopic folds, which gives the animal perfect grip.
Tests with various materials such as glass, Teflon and abrasive paper have demonstrated that the new glue is ten times more effective than the sole of the reptiles mentioned, but "easily separated from the wall," explains Liming Dai, researcher of the engineering arm of the University of Dayton.
"This material can be useful as a temporary glue," says Liming Dai.
Can we walk on the wall, just like Spider-Man? Maybe, but researchers think of less impressive uses than connecting electronic devices because carbon nanotubes drive heat and electricity well.
You can find more applications in space research.
Superheroes can wait.
The University of Berkeley in California is also conducting experiments on a new glue.
According to the article published in American Chemical Society, Californian scientists have presented an adhesive made of microfibre that undergoes self-purification during the movement on the surface, so it always provides perfect grip.
It's forbidden with juice!
Care must be taken with grapefruit, orange and apple.
These high vitamin-containing, especially popular thirst-extinguishing drinks, when taken in combination with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, increasing or reducing their effect, as appropriate. This may have serious health consequences.
David Bailey, Professor of the University of Western Ontario, London, pointed out the risks associated with the use of boxes or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. The professor announced at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and putting the patient's health at risk.
Grapefruit juice had already been placed on the bench of the accused when it was found to be capable of increasing the effects of antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anxiety, heart rhythm control and neurodrugs to a level considered toxic.
RISK MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Institute of Pharmaceuticals itself made the news public in its official publication and at the same time warned doctors and patients to take seriously the risks associated with this co-consumption and to pay attention to what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, both orange and apple juice contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A long list of active substances that are prevented from being absorbed by grapefruit and other fruit juices could be provided.
This is what Michele Carruba, professor of the pharmaceutical department of the State University of Milan, draws attention to: "Discoveries of this kind are usually immediately indicated to the various national and international pharmaceutical institutes who, if necessary, will ensure that the information contained in the information provided by the relevant drug is changed.
That is why you always have to read the information on the medicine you are trying to collect, and if something is not understandable, do not let yourself be influenced, but ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly, 'said the specialist at Ansa.
Paul Krugman won the Nobel Prize for Economics
The American Paul Krugman received the Nobel Prize for Economics for the analysis of the territorial context of commercial models and economic activity.
55-year-old Neokeynesian Krugman, teaches at Princeton University, and is a known publicist of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most intense critics of the Bush government's economic and foreign policy measures.
A few months after the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman predicted in his column in the New York Times, that the latter event would have even more decisive consequences for the history of the United States than the collapse of the Twin Towers.
This forecast has sparked not only a few debates, it has been put in the eye of the economist several times, but we now know that it was accurate.
"I am surprised, and I am a little shocked at how quickly Enron or Worldcom went beyond the scandalous collapse of public interest," said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "very valuable economist ', while, at the same time, disseminating his criticism of the overliberalism of the Bush government in a rather" aggressive manner'.
Open Office, third edition was also worth the "Microsoft Anti-Microsoft" package
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 personal productivity-enhancing open program application package is published, which targets more and more layers as a free alternative to Microsoft Office, from home to office users, from free professions to administration.
Following work carried out by SUN Microsystems and by voluntary developers for almost a year, the new Open Office will come before the general public with several new features: besides the welcome screen and the less rethinking, less Spartan user interface, it will also offer more important novelty. For example, compatibility with Apple Mac OS X operational system and support the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Special attention has been paid to the compatibility with the Office 2007 system, so the Open Office can also open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
The specific function of some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint displays. This may be useful in sending files via email. Another function supports the import of PDF files into the graphics module by keeping the page layout correct.
We can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this interface that combine the typical Adobe format with spreadsheet or text editor elements.
The sharing of applications has also gone through a number of developments: the spreadsheet manager supports the common use of workbooks, but prevents overwriting each other's work. Each employee's comments are marked in different colors, which helps to identify easier at the verification stage.
Some companies are already working to make some of OpenOffice's functions available from the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version will probably be presented in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from the following address: http: / / it.openoffice.org / download / 3.0.0 / download300.html
The program package is available for Linux in addition to the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can take over the installation CD either at home or at work.
Free use at home is probably the most attractive in terms of the spread, but the Open Office programme package is now trying to kick into the business sector as it can expect many administrative and school projects.
There is no lack of education, consultancy and service services ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, Word-compliant text editor; Calc, Table Manager for Excel; Impress, Powerpoint-like presentations; Dbase is similar to the most famous Access Database Manager; and finally Draw is the graphic module.
The 2008 goal is to achieve 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the new version is already at 3,600,000, this number is likely to be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth doping case.
On the last stage of the Tour de France, a positive sample was produced by one of the participants, the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, competing in the colors of the Gerolsteiner team, who, in addition to the bronze medal, won the best high-speed shirt.
The news came out on the website of the Equipe Internet newspaper.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth competitor, the Italian Riccardo Ricci and Leonardo Piepol, and the German Gerolsteiner competitor Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result on the Cera test of the third generation EPO.
Kohl's blood sample was tested by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-malabry, as tested over the last few weeks.
If control tests confirm a positive Cera result, Austrian will lose its third place and will be prohibited from competing for two years according to the regulations.
The news of the positive outcome of Kohl's third-generation EPO test was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the head of the French Anti-Dopping Agency, and communicated to the Associated Press News Agency that he indicated the positive doping results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was able to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and he also won the best high-end polka shirt.

It has only recently changed from the country of emigrants to one of the most popular targets of reluctant immigrants.
Is this the reason why Belpaese is transformed into a racist nation? This question is being addressed by the New York Times, which, based on the case of young Abdul William Guibre in Burkina Faso, who was murdered last month in Milan because he stole a box of biscuits, is dedicated to a long article about the debate on racism in Italy.
The case is well characterized by what the New York Times calls the 'North paradox': in the northern regions, the 'most powerful integration and employment' is also the 'anti-immigrant and support of the North League'.
In support of increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYPD also recalls cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws demanded by the League, which would strengthen the reins on immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, were set as an example of the change of mood in Italy.
This trend was also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano XVI. Benedek met at the Quirinale Palace and suggested that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism."
Students suffer from expensive rentals, it costs up to EUR 900 for a room
The market for accommodation for university students is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey of the Sunia Housing Association, a student can pay up to EUR 900 for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken such amazing proportions that, due to the considerable cost to the families, it blocks a wide range of students from learning," explains Laura Mariani, the head of the study office of the Sunia. "In these cities, the high demand of students has distorted the market to such an extent that there is a general cost-bearing process against local residents."
In most cases, real estate offers include a series of irregularities: non-registered contracts with no lease fee limitation, with related rent.
According to Sunia, an exceptional measure would be necessary to allow price maximisation by reviewing the tax system.
Details of the survey show that in Milan, around Brianza, a single room also costs EUR 450 for a bed; the price of the single room covers an average of EUR 650 (Bande Nere) up to EUR 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but it can also reach EUR 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence, a bed costs an average of EUR 350 / 400, a room of about 700.
In Bologna, where most of the students live near the university, one bed costs EUR 250 / 280 when it is double and EUR 370-500 when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about EUR 600 is requested for a single and 450 bed in a double room.
The prices are slightly cheaper (550 euros for a single room) in the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
In the suburbs you can save some money: it costs 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and other similar districts.
In Naples, they ask for EUR 300 / 450 for one bed, from 400 to 600 euros for one room. Price-setting is highest in the vicinity of Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, EUR 250 / 350 must be paid for one bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they represent more weight within the urban budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU are often looking for accommodation, there is another disorder: the rent requested from foreign students is about 25-30% higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, the days of the old cinema in the cities are over.
Traditional cinemas are closing in for the multiplexes.
"A city with no movies, a blind city, like a face without eyes."
The pictures taken by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively illustrate everything that takes place in Italian cities, but also in rural regions.
The displacement of cinemas - the appearance of large multi-chamber cinema in the suburbs and, as a result, the depopulation of single-grown people in city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time bears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
When historical and memorable places disappear, "it's like a friend of ours going away, a friend of ours who shared our journey and many experiences with us," says the director of Cinema Paradiso. The film, which was the Oscar Award 20 years ago and the Cannes Festival Grand Prize for Tornatore, tells the lyrical story of a small-town cinema after a movie that might have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, Anec, is clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinema theatres have closed. The biggest losses were recorded by cinema in large cities: 10 cinemas in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
The most affected regions are Emilia-Romagna, which lost 82 single-chamber cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, the multiplexing of multiplexes is not more likely to prove it than the number of newly opened multi-room cinemas in these three regions of Italy, which have increased by 195 in the last five years in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and the same in Emilia-Romagna.
"The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally," says the President of Anec Paolo Protti. "It is okay to build new facilities, but it is also necessary to ensure the survival of the existing ones, because when an urban cinema closes, not all visitors are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention unfilled financial funds intended to support operators: the state's outstanding debt is about EUR 10 million.
From both ethical and moral point of view, it is shameful that the government does not comply with the legislation in force.
In order to maintain the market, EUR 16-18 million per year would be needed. '
This is the first Italian city, which, in its concern for closures, decided to remedy the problem by means of an agreement between the municipality and Anec to protect and boost small-town cinema in the suburbs and downtown.
The provisions would include tax advantages to operators and benefits to the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can drive to restricted zones and park at preferential tariffs in certain parking spaces.
"I like this initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
However, it is also certain that traditional cinemas, in order to be able to fight the rule of multiplexes, need to improve sound and image quality, because today's audience is much more demanding.
Protecting the traditional cinema was always an important issue for me: closing the Superperinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that made me finally do Cinema Paradiso, even though I've been thinking about it for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, so when I go to the closed Rialto or Quirinale to see no blackened posters, I turn my head. I've had so many experiences here. "
Close ties between politics and ndrangheta, arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Pyromalli clan in municipal decisions."
Serious charges have been made against the Mayor and Vice-Mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external involvement in a criminal conspiracy.
Handcuffs were placed on the hands of a lawyer nephew named Giovachino Piromalli, a senior middleman between the clan and the administration, who had previously been convicted of participating in a mob-like crime syndicate and had been compensated for EUR 10 million.
"The disregard of all legal and moral rules, more than good taste, is written by state prosecutors." The two local authorities have declared their intention to pay an advisory fee to counsel Piromalli.
"So the clan would have had official access to city hall, which would have given us an additional opportunity to control and control public administration, which is already significant.
The President of the General Assembly of the Calabria region, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "there are many collusions between the local institutions and the organised underworld": there are areas where the proliferation of the mafia is stronger than elsewhere, where collusion is almost inevitable.
However, many local politicians resist the pressure of 'ndrangheta, they are the heroes who remain clean'.
This morning's arrests are the continuation of July events, when the police announced that they had managed to decapitate the Pyromalli clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were relieved of their mandate to manage the municipality. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee was disbanded once in 1991 because of the alleged conflicts between organised crime and the local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, Christian Democrat mayor who was in charge of the right-centre coalition in the second round of 2006.
He cried a scandal when the County House ordered the dissolution of the municipal committee.
He brought the former Deputy Minister of the Interior to trial Marco Mindini and accused him of planning everything for political purposes, but the court stated in the arrest warrant signed this morning that the Pyromalli clan had gone to the point of demanding that the A3 project be changed.
From the eavesdropping of Dal Torrione, the state prosecutors say, "he was willing to meet the demands of an extensive contractor representing a group known to be close to the Pyromalli family, and to subordinate the decisions of the municipality to the Clan interest."
The energy comes from the waves, and now comes the big ones.
An inexhaustible energy source that accounts for 70% of the planet's surface, and which is only now being discovered by large international energy companies.
Waves, sea currents, tides, all renewable energy sources, to which giants like Chevron, who are now trying to put their hands on it.
They have been searching for hundreds of years for the possibility of obtaining energy from the movements of the sea. In the 1970s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
Around 1980, when the price of oil decreased, the idea of using marine energy was put aside, but today the need for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices give the industry new impetus.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimates in 2007 that 15% of the world's electricity demand could be covered by installations using sea wave.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
Besides, there would still be currents and tides.
The Titans are in motion.
Enersis was the first company to commit to maritime energy and signed an agreement on a power plant in Northern Portugal in 2005.
It seemed like a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
Two years have passed, and more and more companies have voted in favour of marine energy, including those who have been committed to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the technologies that exploit the energy of the oceans and considering the possibility of cooperating with us," said the spokesperson of an associated company of the American oil giant, Wall Street Journal, to the economic newspaper.
The cooperation in question concerns the acquisition of a licence to launch a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska issued by the US Energy Commission.
The matter is of no small importance, especially considering the fact that the US is currently in Alaska producing oil, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. and Ocean Power in New Jersey are on the road to energy that can be extracted from the sea.
The technology is waiting to be developed.
According to experts, it is still primitive technology, even because energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about environmental impact.
The existing facilities such as those of Portugal or Scotland are all small and therefore do not cause too much problems in terms of the ecosystem.
However, in order to produce energy on a larger scale, installations which have a significant environmental impact are needed.
There are several possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a connected buoy system.
The shocks generated by the waves and moving buoys up and down are converted into hydraulic pressures by the pistons and cylinders in them.
The pressure is turning a turbine that feeds a generator.
The electric current goes to land on cables under the sea.
For the time being, there are four similar facilities at the planning stage, which are now waiting for a federal permit, and some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, has already started producing energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot with six underwater turbines in the East River Strait of New York.
At tides, the movement of water turns the turbine blades, and this whirlwind nourishes the generator.
Verdant stated that it has a long list of partners who are only waiting for the permits to use energy.
Waves after tides.
At present, particular attention should be paid to the potential to be exploited by tidal tides.
Although it is a temporary phenomenon, tides are more predictable than wind, sun, or waves, so they can be considered as a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states spent $7.5 million in 2008 to exploit the energy supplied by the tides, which is projected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
