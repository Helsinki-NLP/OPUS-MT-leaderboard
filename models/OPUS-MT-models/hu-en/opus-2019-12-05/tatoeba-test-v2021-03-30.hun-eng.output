What are you cooking?
A gray stone building.
I found it in the attic.
Tom was waiting.
Look at you.
Time to rest.
He explained the rule to me.
I was resting.
This old building is not worth retaining, it would be better to tear it down.
We can't get any more.

That's enough!
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things, either destruction, and the dead is unaware of nothing; or, as they say to us, a real change is the migration of the soul from this place to another.
Don't hang out.
That was a stupid question.
If you read the book, can you lend it to me?
If you stop telling me not to be nervous, I probably wouldn't be so nervous.
Of course.
What are you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the vault.
Tom felt it would be a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.
He knows almost nothing about that animal.
Take care.
When Tom woke up, Mari took a shower.
Get your ass out of here!
Everyone's staring at me.
The show is a success.
My father lives and works in Tokyo.
Is he sick or a doctor?

He calls me from time to time.
Something's not right.
Don't patronize me.
I need a room near the elevator.

It was you, wasn't it?
Can you tell me the name of this man?
I'm looking for someone.

That's a big, fat lie.
They've been busy with this for hours.
He was born to be an editor.
I tried to forget.
Let's pay the bill for extra.
Someone stole my bag.
I saw a really good movie last weekend.
The cloud is a large amount of vapor in the sky.
Tom is one of the best singers I've ever heard.
We've been learning French for three years now.
Mary has a handsome husband.
Tomi's been pretending for a while.
There was a storm, and the snow started swirling through the road.
I think you have a very good job.
There's a problem.
The sun seemed to be standing still.
Who thinks so?
By insulting them, you won't bring them to your side.
Tom's fishing, too.
Tom's nose started itching.
Tom bought Mary a drink.
The young woman was so beautiful, even the devil wanted to marry her.
Because of him, I missed my bus.
I'm gonna put a lock on my mouth so I don't blab anything.
We have to act now.
You want a ride home?
Tom's hopeless.
Have you ever committed a violation of the law?
I'm not the coach.
It's very boring.
It's too cold to swim.
My hobby is to collect old toys.
Tomi had to rest.
Mary's pregnant.
I teach Chinese.
It happens every once in a while.
Can I have it?
The flower I saw in the park yesterday was a raflesia.
It all happened fast.
I've had enough of Tommy.
It's cloudy day.
We tried to warn them.
I'm proud of Tomira.
He has a strong faith.
He's studying history at the university.
He hired her.
He likes to tear apart electrical devices.
You were rude.
It was really fun.
Thomas is a hoarder.
They love my mom.
I don't have time to gossip.
Don't forget to write to me.
Everyone worked hard.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Blue looks good on you.
Who did you go there with?
The theatre was designed to enable the audience to get close to the performers and to establish a connection.
I couldn't move my arms.
Excuse me, can you help me?
I can understand that.
Can you hold on for a few minutes?
I'm sure there are 500 books.
Has the mailman been here before?
That helps a little.
It's been a wonderful day.
When are you getting married?
He's tried to call Mary Tamás several times.
Let go of the handle!
Mary's a doctor.
Is that your money?
I'm not used to this kind of treatment.
These kids can't tell the hen from the cow anymore.
Tamás music teacher.
My mother measured my temperature.
Please follow me.
Get out!
Did I make a mistake?
Tom was pale.
Thomas is wonderful.
I already know.
I appreciate what Tom did for me.
Tomi's happy it's over.
Why are you climbing that tree?
He led me to the palace.
There's a woman there who wants to talk to you.
They told him to stand up, and he did it.
That's the problem.
We respect them very much.
How do I get to the airport?
Tom will do almost anything for money.
You need a good rest.
It's a nice day.
You just have to work harder.
This smells good.
We need a change.
To learn a language carefully, you need about 10,000 hours of learning.
It's been two years since he left me.
He lost all his money.
It's not hard.
I came to Tokyo three years ago and I've lived here ever since.
He believes in the innocence of the man.
Can you turn on the light?
They warned him not to be late for school again.
I was looking for the key.
Tom saw it.
It's all clear.
Where did you stay in Boston?
Tom walked.
His main attraction lies in his character, not in his books.
Every car in this garage belongs to Tomi.
That sentence is too long!
How much for the gold ring?
History is written by the winners.
He's a lawyer.
I wish you didn't look like you were having a great time.
Would you like to have dinner with me?
I'd love to write hundreds of sentences on Tatoeba, but I have work to do.
I'll pay you later.
I needed water for Tomi.
I work every day except Sunday.
Tom's red.
Nothing's your fault, is it?
My big toes are starting to get numb.
You don't have to try.
Tom put his money in the bank.
Tom was big.
There's always room for repairs.

Forget it.
We're poor, but we're happy.
I respect Tommy.
It's all dark out there.
Have you heard from him lately?
We'll wait three hours.
Apparently, Tom was late because there was traffic jam on Route 19.
What did Tom say?
Your profession is a dentist.
This is Uncle Tom's farm.
Good night, Mom.
I think I have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I can't imagine getting married.
Everyone says the food in this restaurant is very good.
Do you know what your children are eating?
It seems like it was just yesterday that we went to school together.
Mari loves kids.
The team will be ready.
I wasn't ready for it at the time.
They all expressed their regret of his death.
What was the problem?
It's basically your fault.
Eat slower.
One of the twins is alive, but the other one is dead.
You can e-mail me the file.
We need help up here.
It's free on Sunday.
Tom hid the evidence.
Stay away!
I warned Tommy.
The dog was dead.

Thomas, what's wrong?
He's bringing in clothes from Turkey.
Are you recording this kimono?
Do you have a fire?
Find me a good book from the library.
Tom will stay.
Are you a Nudist?
This has never happened before.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
Whose bag is this?
Mari renovated a house.
I wish I hadn't seen such a terrible movie.
I read this story in some book.
Please spell your name.
Sorry I'm late.
Tom ignored my advice.
He's got a lot of history books.
Don't give me anything.
Moderate exercise stimulates blood circulation.
Everything's fine in the office.
Would you like some orange juice?
I want coffee.

It's true love.
It must have been stolen.
We'll leave as soon as it stops raining.

I forgot.
Stay with me, Tom.
This isn't right.
I don't think Tom ever studied French.
It's great you could make it.
Even Tom wouldn't be stupid enough to ask Mary.
It's not fate for us.
What happened last week?
Tom's lifting weights.
This is a song I sing from the outside.
I want to do everything.
We appreciate your ability.
Tomi turned the napkin into a crane.
Can you do this yourself?
Tom said he didn't see anything.
Take an aspirin.
She's in school.
Are you deliberately trying to confuse me?
I volunteered.
Tom will answer all your questions.
You're gonna need an alibi.
You locked yourself out.
The sentences give an intellectual connection to words, the sentences have personality, they can be funny, smart, stupid, insightful, moving, hurtful.
No, it's not.
My book's not here.

It was a joke.
He was no longer dependent on his parents.
Honestly, you're wrong.
They talk about that and that.
Why worry about that?
I had a beer last night.
Do you have any money for a cab?
These are the things I like.
No one can see it.
It's simple to understand why Tom doesn't like Mari.

A moment's hesitation with a pilot could cost him his life.
I have to go to my office.
How'd the rehearsal go?
Let's not go back to that restaurant.
Do you have a lover?
I saw your name on the list.
I love speaking Spanish.
You had no right to do that.
It's too easy for him.
He didn't like my answer.
Tomi took a 20 out of his pocket.
Tom's advice is not very good.
You put on some weight, didn't you?
Did Tom tell you how he did it?
I love that girl.
Mary accepted the gift.
The crops need rain.
Tom, can I have this?
What do you want me to tell Tomi?

It was a friendly competition.
Get out of here!

Do you have enough time?
They're angry.
Mary's less active than her sister.

I tried to suppress the breaking cry.
My wife's family is very rich.
Tell Tomini I'll be back.
Get out of here!
Someone broke the glass.
Tom, your fly's open.
The boy held a mouse in his hand by the tail.
I want to go there.
I would like to thank you for your great work.
Let's hope not.
Your French language has improved a lot.
Tom won't believe a word you say to him.
Tomi got an "A" on the exam.
Tomi's word against Mari's word.
I don't have time to talk right now.
Have you ever been to Mexico?
They're having coffee at home.
Respect can't be bought.
Tom smiled.
Tom was terrified.
You should never have left early.
This book is used in Spanish.
Health is more important than wealth.
That's exactly what Tom told me.
I'm hungry.
I'm not talking to Tom.
I think all fat people should be on a diet.
What do we do first?
I don't know, I'll call him and ask him.
Can you suggest another appointment?
I gave up too early.
What are you gonna do there?
It's perfectly normal.
What else?
Let me go first.
Tomi left about 30 minutes ago.
All right.
Let's try it.
Tom insisted on paying for dinner.
Buy a piece of cake.
I need scissors.
Shamuel Hadar.
I like to travel alone.
That's not what we want.
My guitar's in the trunk of the car.
We were sitting there.
The glass fell and broke.
Everyone's scared.
That's a good sentence.
I don't have a computer.
Tom's not drowning.
The former tenants left the place in a mess.
Kiss me.
Your theory is far from reality.
Some people look down on others just because they have less money.
The witch cursed the poor girl.
Tom didn't show much interest.
Your work is done.
I want to pay for it now.
I want to ask you something.
I answered the question.
Mary solved the mystery.
Do you have any water?
How can I stop Tom?
Tom just arrived.
I usually eat with my family at home.
You shouldn't have done that.
We can't prove anything.
You can ski on that hill.
Tom was drunk, so Mary drove him home.
I don't speak English.
The party Tom organized was a huge success.
Tom was naked.
We saw a castle in front of us.
Have you ever seen Tommy go crazy?
Tomi seemed surprised, too.
I often go swimming in the river.
Don't worry about them, they're just a bunch of idiots.
I regret visiting Australia.
They do the same things I did when I was a kid.
That's great.
I fell off the ladder.
Mary went to her gym class.
The report was prepared in a hurry, and there were several spelling errors.
Tom is neither rich nor famous.
Everyone's gone silent.
Tom's in the criminal record.
I'm arriving in Boston tomorrow night.
He invited me personally.
I have to go to the bathroom.
I'm looking for something to eat.
He can't stop it.
I've learned so much about Tom.
I need a job right away.
Everyone's still asleep.
Dog barking.
Tom decided to go home early.
That was our biggest problem.
You're very kind.
I'm deaf, too.
I'm so proud of my team.
Sit down.
I don't know where I am.
Tom's not very educated.
He's very proud of his talent.
Have you ever been in a long-distance relationship?
All passengers were taken off the plane.
I need a red pen.
He didn't know what to do with the problem.
I'm thirsty now.
My dad's going to work on a bike.
Where's Tomi?
Don't be so emotional.
I run eight kilometers a day.
I never understood Tom.
We had to be there.
Tom made breakfast.
He's definitely the smartest student in the class.
You should have called the cops.
I'll keep it a secret.
Tom hasn't flown a broomstick yet.
You spilled your coffee.
I couldn't have done better myself.
Tom became a member of this club three years ago.
My wristwatch is so small, I can't change it.
Go home quickly.
I'm not crazy.
You found my cat.
I thought Tom was coming.
If you like flowers, you can't be a bad person.
Einstein says everything is relative.
The old book was moldy.
Only adults.
He's about your height.
Tom's honest.
It's important that we help those in trouble.
You can't teach an old dog new tricks anymore.
I need to let off some steam.
I like occitan.
I see what you mean.
There's work to be done.
Tell him you love him before it's too late.
Can you lend me the book when you're done with it?
I already told you that.
That would cause a catastrophic accident in the work area.
What do you think of my theory?
Give me some time to figure out what went wrong.
Tom's not afraid to die.
We don't have enough information.
My home is far away.
The bus is on its way.
There's the biggest lake in Turkey.
The radio's broken.
There are no houses on the other side of the road.
Either way, you're gonna have to wait your turn...
I can't speak Turkish.
Tom checked his pockets.
The rain got even more intense.
Tom does that to everyone.
Are you logged in?
We're about to change that.
I don't want to talk about the weather.
My request has been denied.
We were surprised to hear the news.
Don't underestimate yourselves.
I'm Antonio.
This is where I met my friend.
I've traveled all over Russia.
I like to annoy Tommy.
Tomi is our son.
He's a stranger.
You can't know the truth.
Tomi is enraged by the least critical remark.
Believe it or not, it's the truth.
I went without him.
He loves his brother.
Where else would we go?
If you don't like this, you can go.
Tom's gonna pay.
I see.
Tom was just bored.
I don't want to see him.
Help yourself if you want anything to eat.
Dad's still in bed.
Do you have to work on Sundays?
We got divorced with a good feeling.
We haven't had a problem yet.
What color are your hair?
In that chair you're sitting in, I was sitting in yesterday.
You're not benevolent.
I hope Tomi understands.
Do you believe in ghosts?
I thought I could trust you.
The noise woke me up.
Compassion is for losers.
The snow took the whole city in one night.
I'll explain later.
Honestly, I don't really care.
Autumn is the best hiking season.
Tom's gone?
They called the vet because there were no other doctors in the village.
I know what I want.
Don't let him swim.
Believe in yourself.
You work Monday?
What's your commission?
The dean shook hands with senior students.
I live in Milan.
Tom can come anytime.
I think time will solve this problem.
Why did you put your shirt together?
I'd rather stay home and watch TV.
Tom's a Christian?
Ask Thomas to explain.
You broke it.
I slept at the window open because of the heat.
The sun is saved.
He lost his umbrella again.
Let's go to the movies.
I want to fight!
A Nazi killed a Jew.
We don't know exactly.
If you want to get out of here alive, listen to me.
Instead of German, we studied French.
Wonderful!
Is that what everybody wants?
Are you breaking up with me?
You can't believe a word he says.
I love Spanish!
I'm going for a walk to clear my head.
A little work won't hurt anyone.
A chain is as strong as its weakest eye.
He calls me a lot.
I'm applying for the job today.
I'll try to keep you informed.
Tom said Mary was Canadian.
My father went to Greece.
My Berber skills are pretty ugly.
The King has destroyed his enemies.
You're talking!
I want Mary to let Tommy finish.
I'm exhausted.
We have a big problem.
You're too drunk to drive.
The crying turned his eyes red.
You're going there without me.
Tom will starve.
It's not a secret.
I was wrong about that.
Have some, please.
We're gonna do this together.
Can you help me, please?
She saw Mary Tomi smiling.
He's in a hurry to catch the eight o'clock train.
They saw him as a hero because he saved his friend's life.
Your father would be proud of you.
Just give me a few seconds.
I don't understand why I love Tom so much.
Tomi has sharp vision.
He promised me he'd be here by 4: 00.
I don't want to lose this game.
The education system is changing.
There they are.
Hey, guys.
Tom ate a bowl of blueberries.
I don't feel like waking up.
Thomas thought Mary had financial problems.
When I hear the news, I get goose bumps.
He couldn't resist the temptation.
Why should we worry about what happens after we die?
We have to help each other.
At some point, my dream will come true.
He spent all the money I gave him.
We used to be neighbors.
Do you think I should tell Tom?
What's it worth to you?
Do you know how to do this?
My dad's a doctor.
How old is your grandfather?
I don't have a nickname.
Who loves Tommy?
Kill Tom!
I think I'm dying.
What's it made of?
Tom has a scratch on his forehead.
We're cool.
You're smarter than you think.
Have you seen my camera?
Tom did a lot of great things.
I've been really busy.
There's a limit to everything.
Don't be a smart-ass.
You're gonna pay for this!
It would be nice to have a collection of the last words of famous people at our disposal.
I'm a social worker.
The ceremony was amazing.
I believe your words.
Different how?
Tom has as many servants as he needs.
Tom wants to succeed.
Nothing happened.
Were you in the library yesterday afternoon?
I like you more than that.
He wrote ten books, but he didn't publish any of them.
Tom's at home with his parents.
I don't really want to eat right now.
Tom is happy with his success.
No one was hit.
You can do this for you.
It doesn't take much time.
I hate lawyers.
Tom said you hate dancing.
If you have time, why don't you check his gallery?
I was nervous at first, but then I calmed down gradually.
I don't want to buy this kind of couch.
You have to ask Tommy first.
Explain it to me.
I'm aware of the difficulties.
I'm not sick.
Where are you from, Karen?
It's frozen somewhere in the mountains.
Tom went that way.
Tom spilled milk in his cat's bowl.
I feel like something terrible is going to happen.
Is that it?
Tom's not married.
There's no one there.
We were enemies.
Tom intimidated Mari.
I had no idea you didn't speak French.
I had two dogs.
They're completely different from me.
We can't save everyone.
Tom's sitting down.
Where's the moon when it's not up in the sky?
This is one of the best places in town.
I just need directions.
Tom was supposed to be an actor.
I ignored it.
The dam broke, and water flooded the valley.
You look very pale.
Bring him in.
I'm helping Thomas.
I made a lot of money on the side.
I'm gonna tell Tom what he should tell Mari.
I haven't eaten yet.
I accept your terms.
I'm a good cook.
This is an accident!
Can I open my eyes now?
Car's blue.
I was sick, I stayed home all day.
Tom was born in Boston.
Can you wait a second?
Spiders have eight legs.
I'm still a kid.
Tom despises women.
That's ugly.
I work as a bus driver.
I think you know him.
That's enough.
We didn't have dinner.
I finally caught you.
I'll give the message to Tomini.
Mari was too shy to admit her feelings.
Tom should have done a lot better.
Which songs were they singing?
I'm going home to Boston.
Already or not?
Mr. Harrison was sitting on his porch with lugas on his sleeve, smoking his evening pipe.
I don't feel like studying French today.
Tom's a mess.
Go, but without me.
I was a fool to trust Tomi.
What kind of beer is it?
That was a secret.
I trust him.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
Japan has diplomatic relations with China.
My parents are dead.
Not everything is black and white.
You have no right to judge these people.
It definitely freaked me out.
Tom and Mary ordered the same thing.
That's what we're discussing.
Would you like to go shopping with me?
The tap water is not healthy.
Can you crack an egg with one hand?
Tom has a twin.
He's here to protect you.
Tom seemed very worried.
Tomi's got guts.
There's a book on the table.
It is important that we promote our language in every possible way.
When's the next train leaving?
Sometimes I don't understand him.
Any time, you can ask me anything.
I love you.
This isn't your hat, is it?
Tom doesn't have to talk to me if he doesn't want to.
You might as well go home now.
It's just an empty threat.
We have two old chestnut trees in front of our house.
They were screaming.
The snowflakes fell on her long blonde hair.
I don't recognize anyone in this picture.
I hope we don't make you uncomfortable.
Let's discuss this outside.
Tamás is studying chemistry.
He keeps his word.
I don't expect any special treatment.
His old friends turned away from him.
Tom didn't put enough sugar in my coffee.
I'm sure I won't pass tomorrow's exam.
The sentence is fine.
The new furniture arrived today.
Horses!
I've never seen anything like it in my life.
I'm calling Tommy right now.
I broke up with my girlfriend.
Hopefully, things will be fine.
Paul is clockwork.
She replaced the butter with Margarine.
That was popular in the '90s.
Everyone did.
People are like goldfish in aquarium?
I live in a little cottage not too far from here.
Tom risked it.
Excuse me, can I help you?
The paragraph the teacher asked Sarah to read it wasn't very interesting.
Tom and Mari are both good teachers.
Tom gave Mari his number.
He lives across the street from Rod John.
The soup is very hot.
There's no money for this to sell.
Tom would have walked.
Tell Tom to meet us at the station.
Professional diver.
It's good to see you again.
Tom was a good worker.
Everyone has the right to be stupid, and some people abuse that right.
I just need a little encouragement.
Dani found out Linda passed away.
I'm not the man I used to be.
I'm not Catholic.
Let's rest here.
We're out of money.
I don't want to walk with you.
I don't understand anything.
What's the price for this hat?
I'm from Trondheim.
Tom doesn't know.
I need more space.
Tom taught me the most of what I know in French.
Shall we have a drink?
He keeps his money in a bank.
I don't care if you believe me.
What do you think these are?
It's hard to please everyone.
There's a solution.
How much do you think Tom makes?
It's not like that.
This world is governed by evil forces.
He laughed to hide his fear.
I'm in line.
Can I have a kilo of boneless tuna, please?
Don't make noise.
The story was real.
The wounded screamed at the pain after the anesthesia wore off.
This is what I need.
How much money do you have?
Focus.
They don't talk at all.
Cease fire!
He always asks for your opinion.
We use margarine instead of butter.
I'm very happy with this reception.
When two people do the same thing, it's not the same thing anymore.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
How much money is Tom gonna get?
Is it true that Tom committed suicide?
Serbia borders with Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
You might as well follow his advice.
My name is Ricardo, and yours?
She speaks in Mary's sleep.
I don't expect this to ever happen again.
This is for you, Tom.
Get me another beer.
My shoelaces got stuck in the escalator.
How does ice cream taste?
Thomas speaks French.
I'm sleeping.
He doesn't understand you.
I'll explain.
Tom retired a few years ago.
We're all safe.
It was a success.
Calm down.
They drank two bottles of wine.
Come tomorrow.
Can we try this?
The table is green.
Tom was supposed to win the race.
I have to be the one to write it down.
I'm not there yet to give up.
I don't want to know either.
Fate often gives us what we don't expect.
What's the recipe?
We're competitors.
Give me a painkiller, please.
You're crazy.
He had a bad cold, so he didn't come to school today.
Something's not right.
They're going to negotiate tomorrow.
This table has a smooth surface.
Open up!
Do you understand English?
He got up early to see the sunrise.
Tom took part in a web conference.
Am I sensing sarcasm?
It's hard to steal from a thief.
Tommy's never gonna get out of his way.
Tell me, where is the police?
She was so tired, she fell asleep.
I hope to learn your beautiful language in the near future.
Tom was so paranoid.
I need tools.
I'll count to three.
Don't talk.
Tomi didn't even know how to thank you in French.
Where's the nearest pharmacy?
I sang.
Tom and Mari are as different as fire and water.
Tom's a good performer.
We have less than three hours.
Tom's parents were hippies.
This is a mistake.
This car looks like mine.
What an idiot you are!
It may be obvious to you, but not to me.
Don't try to imitate me.
No one can know everything.
He's a bus driver.
Don't eat.
But that's not the real problem.
What's the title of the book?
Tom loved me.
Are you telling us the truth?
Russia is big.
Who's the woman standing there?
Tom's declared bankruptcy.
Tom was the most powerful man in town.
I can't wait to get married.
Is it cold in Germany?
Leave my camera alone.
You have to go crazy.
Don't ask me to help you anymore.
I'm not coming.
I thanked you.
Let's get a pine tree.
It's not drinking water.
Did you know them personally?
Tom doesn't look very happy, does he?
Please speak up.
You need to keep your eyes open.
Tomini has a black cat.
Courage creates heroes, and trust creates friendships.
Again, he came up with the old story.
Tom bought Mary a box of chocolates.
My fate is in your hands.
Let's talk about something else.
The light went out, and we stayed in the dark.
I'm planning on cleaning my room.
The horse stopped and refused to go further.
He accused them of stealing.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I've decided to join the volunteer firefighters.
Tom got up, but then he sat down again.
I like melons.
I'd rather not go out today.
The woman sitting there is your current wife.
I got the letter.
I feel so much better today.
The train arrived on time.
You can't do anything wrong by learning language.
Shut up or I'll have you thrown out.
Is everything ready?
I have to go.
I'm not yelling.
There's nothing to justify their existence.
Mathematicians are poets, they just have to prove what their imagination has created.
I'm cooperative.

Seventy-five divided by five is fifteen.
What were you doing last night?
Let's have a doughnut.
Tom's intentions were not pure.
Do you have my book?
Please think about it.
Tom did what he wanted.
I can see the light.
I'm only as guilty as anyone else.
You're worse than me.
Don't talk to me like that.
There's nothing urgent.
Tom won't hurt me.
He's a vegetable salesman.
You can't always win.
It's a silver coin.
I feel helpless.
Goodbye.
I'm fat.
It's already 10: 00 in the evening.
The road is full of potholes.
What do the papers say?
You were lucky.
Can I go home?
If time allows, let's go for a picnic.
I love you, but I'm not in love with you.
- Whose rings are these?
I'm convinced that this tennis match will be won by me.
They went to Boston.
One of us is wrong.
I was surprised by what I learned.
Elephants have two ears.

My hobby is reading novels.
You'll get used to it soon.

We helped each other.
This happened when he was out there.
Tom painted the door green.
Just start working.
I'm sure I'm hallucinating.
Tom cleaned Mary's car.
Let's go over it.
You're the most important thing in my life.
But the proposed changes contradicted each other.
I planted this tree.
Tom let me go.
May I have your full name?
Boring!
I care what he says.
I told you this wouldn't work!
Tom gave Mary chocolate.
Don't complain, don't explain.
Here's your boarding pass.
I saw one.
What do you do for a living?
Tom Mary's boss.
It's small, or there's no chance of finding the real conspirators at all.
They let Tom down.
Too bad I'm late.
Tomi didn't agree with Mari.
I want to put a smile on your lips.
Is that a bird?
I've had enough of Tom and Mary.
Is that a wolf?
There's a military base nearby.
You have to do this.
I'm having a bad day.
All right, everybody, let's go.
Tom went on a trip with his friends.

Tom was trying to reduce his costs.
Tom told the dog to sit down.
Tomi's never coming back, is she?

To me, he's like a king.
He looks young.
I'm from Japan.
I saw Dana.
Tom's good with animals.
I didn't register.
The salt you put in the soup is white, not pink.
I always look after you.
Tom started cleaning.
I take the train to work every day.
You look nervous.
Now we have to get started.
Do you really believe in magic?
I don't know exactly where I was born.
I'm scared of Tommy.
I'm glad we agree on something.
Then the bear ran to the wheelbarrow, threw his bear skin and touched it with the magic wand that the witch gave him, and in a moment the skin turned into a beautiful moon-made baleen dress, and the wheelbarrow turned into a carriage drawn by two dancing horses.
Don't make mistakes.
Are you busy right now?
He's giving his time to the books.
Is he tall?
I'll wait for Tomira.
I heard you weren't going home either.
I'm sick and tired of your complaints.
Young people today are smart.

The whole town knows.
Someone put me in.

There were some ink stains on that book cover.
He wanted to go out.

He was a poor musician.
Animals are our friends.
I don't like surprises like that.
He was a cruel man.
It's an opportunity.
This is Tom's house.
I know you can help us.
I saw him with my own eyes and heard him with my own ears.
Would you excuse us for just one second, please?
Which one's your beer?
I won't allow them to use my Husqvarna chainsaw.
Everything in the bathroom was paved all the way to the ceiling.
I'll read the description to get it working.
There was silence in the area.
They were skiing.
Tom has no idea what's real.
Hey, listen to me.
You live with your parents?
