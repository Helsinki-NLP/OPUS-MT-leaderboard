I want to be invisible.
You're going to school.
Are you talking about it?
Are you all right?
I'm so sorry.
I'm here to stay.
I've seen some stress in the zoo.
I'm really sorry.
Do you want to go?
Look, an abyia tree.
Tom wanted this.
I'm pretty tall.
I'm a dear man.
He was trying to be a girl.
All right?
I don't need any kind.
I lost my pencil.
I didn't forget it.
Where do you speak French?
I want a guitar.
What are you doing?
Thank you!
I know Tom well.
I've got the list.
Are you here?
He was a beautiful girl.
It's hot.
My book is on your desk.
Tell me what you want.
She's in the toilet.
Tom didn't know that Mary was very happy to speak French.
You!
Look, apricot tree.
He hasn't written the letter yet.
I spent all the time answering the emails.
They're dying.
I like to hear.
It can't be.
This is not a sentence.
Tell me what you want.
Can I have a small bread waiting for you?
They're burning them.
Is he white?
Have you got a car?
It's a lot of compassion.
Tom didn't want to walk along his dad's directions.
I'm very tall.
You're coming in Tatoeba!
Tom was talking.
Have you a car?
Mersi.
I lost my phone.
There's a lot of fruit.
What's your address?
Who's ate all the cookies?
I'm not waiting.
Do you like the black citizens?
It wasn't my fault.
Don't talk to me!
NAF, it's as funny as possible.
He was very poor.
I'm sorry.
I'm ready.
He was treated as a woman.
Is it always raining?
Warning!
It's raining in my heart.
I'm not alone.
Don't leave me alone.
I don't know.
My money was stolen from me somewhere.
Studying a foreign language is a life.
Tom's on the door.
Tom was ready.
A cat came from under the desk.
I came alone.
Luun, Meurzh, Merc'her, Yaou, Gwenner, Saturday, is the last day of the week.
And you enjoyed it?
I don't leave my unit.
Give me the salt, please.
More coffee, please.
He was very poor.
Mersi!
There were many people in the community.
I'm telling you good luck.
Tom loved his friends in love with his friends
Lol, it's so funny.
I don't need anything.
Good night!
Look, a Japanese apricot tree!
I understand it.
Sit down.
I know you know.
Nice.
Please respond.
Tom was talking about you.
Tom was talking.
Tom saw that.
Burj Khalifa is the tallest skyber in the world of the day.
Are you all right?
I'm not waiting.
Give me the salt?
I've got bad news.
Tom said he was fighting.
There isn't any need for any help.
I'll work alone.
Take the water with you.
Where is the saluting?
And Tom's been there?
It's raining in my heart.
Vaglana just like ironism.
It's my car.
I must go.
It's enough to go on the table.
Look, an acety woman.
It's French.
Tom wanted this.
They lost again.
I want to die with Gitter Jaani.
I'm fine that your father's dead.
Bennoz, Yukina.
It's not so big.
There's a lot of big cities in Brazil.
The horse is black.
I'm so happy.
He sang a song.
I'm sure.
I'm sorry.
Thank you!
It's not white.
Look, a freak.
My dad's not at home.
They'll go away.
Opened the door and got out of the car
You can't eat here.
I need advice.
He's in Tokyo.
I don't want to be a soldier like his father.
I've done it.
They lost again.
I saw Tom there.
He was very poor.
I've picked up a filter.
I like to travel.
Tom could call him the police if he could.
Bara and sugars.
We're going home.
I'll continue.
I want a guitar.
My dollar is full with filters
Are you serious?
Warning!
I could have done something like that once.
Look a blue-hair.
I'm all right.
I'm putting some chickens on my knees.
Tom is the only one who knows what happened.
Great spirits.
Look, an akokantera tree.
And with you?
I'm always going to sleep before midnight.
You awake?
How much is that?
One fort voiceest attenuation.
I'm living in Japan.
I'm not special.
NAF!
When were you born?
Tom plays rugby.
Sunday is the last day of the week.
I'll hold it.
It's not my cat, and my one that's white in his feet
Look, this is an akasia tree.
How much is this clock?
The horse is white.
I'm sick.
I still have questions to ask you.
Friends do things together.
It wasn't my fault.
It's late.
I saw him running.
He's alive.
Tom didn't know about Mary's contact between John and John.
I'm really talking about it.
It's a big man.
I'll work alone.
I love her.
Tom plays rugby.
Thank you very much.
I see something.
Tom's best to make people do things for him.
Tom was there.
Tom's very well known.
Come on!
I'm better not to stay.
I've got to go.
Who's that guy?
Thank you.
White bread, please.
He came a cat from under the table.
It wasn't cheap, wasn't it?
Did he go there?
The house is very cute.
Tom was a safare.
I remember you.
I'm so happy.
I don't like it.
I'm not working.
I've finished.
This movie was very pleased to Dom and I'm late for BARI.
I don't speak Spanish.
If you've finished the salt, please give it to me.
I have a seat in my arm.
Are you eating meat?
Yeah.
It's a pain to eat.
Let's have a smoke-like pothole.
It's raining in my heart.
I've got to finish with my uses
Do you know that something bad happened?
Are you sisters?
I'm still here.
Are you able to take SIDA an alternative to private papers?
I want something funny.
Where is the problem?
I lost my pen.
I want to die with Gitter Jaani.
Have you got the money?
I'm not doing that. I'm not gonna die.
I didn't listen.
I know you were.
Tom's hit?
Only one language is enough.
Have you ever been in Paris?
Tell me what you want.
I'm an expert.
I'll see something.
Call the police.
They turned back.
Bara and games.
Tom didn't believe Mary when she said he loved him.
I laughed a lot.
Tom's gonna get out of a French trip.
I don't speak Japanese.
I know you know.
I know you were.
It's French.
Where do you speak French?
Tom is dressed in a manner that is quite wide for him
She's a dog.
I think they're all right.
There's a lot of shit on the face.
Mersi, Yukina.
And you're jealous?
He was late again.
Compulsion for Paris.
I'm coming to your feet.
You're better not to go.
I'm not angry with you.
I've got a lot of laughs.
Thank you, brothers.
Where did you buy French?
I've got it.
Sur you?
I heard him out of the way.
I've lost my trust.
He's a funny boy.
A beer, please!
You've taken everything.
Who's this guy?
I've got two shits.
Look, an akasia tree.
Have you had two orders?
I've got kids.
The art of eating bread.
I don't know how much people are.
He was too late for me.
Do you speak Japanese?
I'm here from England.
Are you really funny?
I don't know.
This house isn't very big.
This house isn't very big.
I'm not working.
I think it's beautiful.
I know Tom well.
Have you ever been in Paris?
I didn't take any matches.
I'll work alone.
NAF, what?

You feel like you?
How much does a room cost?
I didn't sleep.
Thanks to you!
I didn't take a shower.
I'm gonna give you a good heart.
Have you seen a great weapon?
Tom is not a student, he is one of the teachers.
I don't eat at home as much as I did before.
Look, a woman's adenium.
He was very poor.
Look, a sound.
What's this clock?

What would you do?
I'm eating a apple.
He was very poor.
I don't think I've got some smokes like licking a lighter.
Where do you speak French?

I came alone.
Lol, this is so funny.
Tom's breakfast.
That's not a sentence.
Nice!
The car is green.
