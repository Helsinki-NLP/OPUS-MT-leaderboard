Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricane home win at the opening - Savo Volley's second win
After seven consecutive men's flight ball, Hurrikaani-Loima, on the medals of the Master League, began the 2018-19 season with home wins when Raision Loimu fell on Saturday 3-0.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective player in Hurricane at 22 points.
There were some influences abroad, but they didn't come true, and then a call came from Land.
Pretty fast, Kouki said.
Like Kouk, Tomi Rumpune, who played in Loimussa, supported Koukia at 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the country team contract player Samuli Kaislasalo 17 points.
The winning of the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience from the other side, and it brought extra extra to the game.
Our game is not yet ready, but the continuation of the medal pipeline is, of course, a goal, Kouki said.
Precise Savo Volley's most effective
Miro Määttänen was 18 points at Savo Volley's most effective when the team landed next to Vantaa Ducks in 3-0.
Our game was stunning, especially at the head of the attack, but fortunately, we were able to win.
At least I didn't have any other conscious downloads when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Next to the flight ball in 3 series in the period 2000-01 Antti Siltala, who started her career, made 12 points.
Chief Coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, the mood on the roof all the time.
A good fiilis was left with the house opening.
Miro was king, Silli played a good game, said Tuovinen.
The last season of the bridge in the League was 2006-07, then he won silver in Pielaveden in Sammo Tuovise when he was the principal coach.
Thiago Maciel was the most effective of Ducks at 14 points.
Mikkonen again Akaa-Volley Star
In the period 2012-13, Joni Mikkonen has won the league's score exchange with a strong start to this season.
The hacker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley took the season's opening win after dropping Kokkolan Tigers 3-2.
The season has begun from one's place.
Today there was a loss near, because we had four rounds of loss 17-21.
There was some sort of bounty digging, and the fifth round came there at the same time, said Mikkonen.
The most effective tigers in the final matches a few years ago was the 28-point hacker Edvarts Buivids.
Maj Aleksandrs Kudriashovs supported at 17 points.
There's not much to get into the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland's comparison of human capital world number one
Finland is at the top of the world in comparison with human capital, reports Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was the first in statistics.
In 2016, it was almost the same as in 1990.
In the past, Finland was followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, Holland was placed on one higher and instead of Canada, Taiwan was found on the list.
In 2016, the worst comparison was Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, consideration will be given to the level of education in the population, access to education, skills and health.
The World Bank has aligned human capital with economic growth.
Real Madrid Thibaut Courtois held at Atletico, the local game ended untapped
The real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stretched to splendid fights, and the local game of the Madrid teams ended up on the untapped game late Saturday in the Spanish football team.
Atletico Madrid Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest goal, but the Belgian watchman Courtois was able to fight.
Courtois played at Atletico three times on a loan wash while he was Chelsea's player.
At the beginning of the week, the International Football Union Fifa chose him as the goalkeeper of the year.
In Real, Gareth Bale got the best painter, but his shot went past at the end of the opening half of the paint.
Bale was left after a break for a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, the disappointed supporters of Real cried out the name of Christiano Ronaldo who moved to Juvenile.
In the United States, there is now an attack on abortion law, and a powerful documentary tells us why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to find out whether one of the nine members of the Supreme Court could be elected as candidate for President Donald Trump, Brett Kavanaugh.
In the Republican Party, many hope that the decisive voice of Kavanaugh could be repealed by a decision known as Roe against Wade, which made legal abortion in the United States in 1973.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's documentary film Reversing Roe - United States and abortion rights tells us how the current situation has come over the years.
As unbelievable as it feels, the topic is topical in Finland as well.
The Foreign Minister Timo Soini (sin) has done public work against safe abortion and has received various degrees of support from the majority of the representatives of our country.
At the beginning of a vigorous document, Gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who has been the only doctor in Missour State who has remained an abortion due to the blackmail of the laws.
The Clinic's armed guard says he's defending U.S. freedom of religion.
The news videos remind the clinics of the murderous terrorist attacks.
The time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
The Lutheran churchmen's association then guided women's trustworthy abortion doctors.
The reason for the challenged pastor is good, but actually they don't even need them, a photograph of the woman who died in abortion itself is enough.
There were about 5,000 deaths in the United States a year.
The legalisation of abortions was advocated, in particular, by the Republican Party.
Already in 1967, in California, Governor Ronald Reagan signed an abortion law.
Later, in his 1980 presidential election campaign, Reagan began to reverse religion into politics and voters.
His abortion position also turned his successor George Bush older.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document to the deepest core of the matter is reached in the search for the root cause for abortion policy.
When religious organizations that supported racial separation were denied tax freedom, they became politically active.
An abortion was chosen as a horse of knights.
Religion has brought exceptional ties into politics.
This is the case in the United States where, with its sexual harassment, the voices of the religious right on its abortion basis have been chosen as a candidate for Kavanaugh, who is now accused by a number of women of sexual harassment.
Kavanaugh may be empowered to decide on the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
The Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children at the border with large demonstrations.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel has fired demonstrators in the border zone.
On Friday, Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border zone, reports the Palestinian Ministry of Health.
According to the Ministry of Health of Palestine, there are two children among the dead: 12- and 14-year-old boys.
According to the Ministry, 505 people have been wounded.
Of these 89 were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and made a free attack to the border zone when the demonstrators threw Israeli troops on rocks and explosives.
The army says that it has begun the use of power that demonstrators do not break the border or seek to the other side of the border.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza demonstrations since March, when Palestinians started weekly demonstrations on the border.
According to the UN Human Rights Representative, there are 12 000 people who are vulnerable.
Demonstrators demand Palestinian families access to areas where Palestinians had to leave when the Israeli State was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosions dropped from the Palestinian side by lions and helium balls have sparked forest areas and croplands in Israel.
The teemum Santa got a penalty kick. He couldn't shoot himself.
Wigan's top partner, Chey Dunkley, seemed to have dumped him with a tachograph on the ground.
Judge Gavin Ward let the game go on.
According to his interpretation, the coupling was clean.
The teem of Santa couldn't believe her eyes.
I think the situation was in trouble with Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick at 85 minutes when Santa was dumped.
Ward showed me a penalty bill, and Mario Vrancic knocked out a 1-0 win goal.
Santa has made five goals for Norwich in the Master's series.
The previous one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
The job was good for Santa again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created paint situations and defended it untiringly.
The match for Norwich was five in two weeks.
The team will continue in the league.
There's a five-win pipe behind it.
The paedophile support service was immediately filled with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 experiences interest in children
According to the estimate, 2% of men and a small proportion of women are experiencing at least some sexual interest in predecessors.
This means about 40,000 people in Finland.
To date, sexually interested children or adolescents have been difficult to get help.
The joint SeriE project of the Criminal Care Foundation and Sexpo trains professionals to meet paedophiles as customers and helps people who experience sexual interest in children.
When the project was reported in spring, the Sexpo email flood and meeting hours were very quickly booked, Yle tells us.
However, these are promised to be released during the autumn.
The sexual preference for children causes many to be ashamed.
Most of the pedophic emotions themselves have not realized their fantasies or thus done anything criminal.
However, pleasure is usually a permanent feature.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also complicate normal life, says the sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, who serves as a special expert in the project.
I think work is valuable if one child is saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The Korean leaders or the Congolese gynecologist?
As the winner of the US President Donald Trump Nobel Peace Prize - the idea may sound awkward, but Trump is one of the biggest prize winners, based on betting factors.
The backdrop is Trump's role in getting North Korea at least at the level of speeches to commit to nuclear disarmament.
On the basis of reports from South Korea, the main favourites of the Nobel peace recipients are Moon Jae and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have already met three times this year and promised to pursue a peace agreement between their countries.
The warming of the inter-Koreans is significant, as the inter-Koreans were still good last year.
Yet the rewarding of Kim, who is leading with the iron grip on nuclear weapons for years would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The winners of the Nobel Awards will be released from Monday, and on Friday, the most attention will have to be paid to the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not given to those participating in the Korean Peninsula diplomacy, it is one of the congolese doctors, Denis Mukwege.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women who have been victims of mass rape and has become a leading expert in the world.
Mukwege has been working to focus on sexual violence, which is a terrifying by-product of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Organization, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been held as a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has reported that this year there are 331 candidates for the award.
The names of the candidates will not be reported to the public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if Nobel had it.
In May, the journalist asked him in the White House if he thought he deserved a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the whole world, the President continued referring to the North Korea negotiations.
But there are things that make Trump Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee has often given recognition to individuals and organisations representing liberal democracy and a multifaceted world order - such international cooperation as has been seen as Trump's opponent.
In the 2000s, the award has been awarded by three US politicians who have all been democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007 and Barack Obama in 2009.
Thus, rewarding Trump would require the Nobel Committee to have an ideological full turn.
A fire announcement in the tunnel: Car drivers behaved like sopules and drove in the wrong direction
The traffic gap in Lohja on the 1st Street took place on 8 September.
As a result of the notification, traffic in the tunnel area was cut in both the direction of Turku and Helsinki.
When it found out that it was a systemic breach, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
However, it did not work very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Road Transport Center said it couldn't be opened because there are car drivers in the road with a socket of swine and they're driving the way it hurts, the emergency fireman Pasi Kääriäinen told STT that he was fresh at the time.
At that time, the engines were left to go even in the wrong direction only after a moment of waiting.
When the first starts to act against the traffic rules, a few others often follow, the Transport Security Contact Manager Tapio Heiskanen amazes.
According to the traffic rules, motorways and tunnels must stop for only a compelling reason.
Transport security reminds us that in exceptional situations it is impossible to leave to jeopardise transport through urgent solutions.
Alert vehicles shall always be provided with the most unimpeded route.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as well as making u-turn and withdrawing.
The same prohibitions are also in force in tunnels where driving lights must always be switched on.
It is also prohibited to stop without compelling reasons, as is of course also parking.
Backwards there have even been cases where the driver has stopped in the tunnel to brush snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this action, Heiskanen says in the Transport Security Communication.
The Ilves fans would've wanted to keep celebrating even though the ship was caught on the lake base.
The Ilves fans of the inland waterway M/S Tampere would have wanted to remain on board to continue their victory celebration, even though the boat had been caught at the base of the lake, tells Juho Syrjä, the ship's leader at the time of the event.
The M/S Tampere on his way to Tampere took off the route late Saturday night and was caught at the bottom of Vanajavede in Akaa.
19 passengers on board the ship and five crew members were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one got hurt in the hart.
The Ilves fans would have wanted to continue their celebration on the ship until the morning, but of course it was more reasonable to send them on a fire department to the port and on a bus home, Syrjä told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlin to follow the game of Ilves and HPK, which ended with the 4-3 victory of Ilves.
According to Syrjä, Saturday's hare was due to the water surface on Vanajawater being about half a meter lower than normal.
According to Syrjä, navigation was also hampered by the fact that the nearest pathway was covered by log debris, which is why its reflections were not normally seen in the dark autumn.
No mention of a collision
Haveri took place on the west side of the Jumusensalm shortly after the ship's route had undergone the bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
According to Syrjä, there was no greater dramaticity, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident, and no more significant impact was caused by hitting the ground.
According to the Cyrjä, landing at the bottom has not caused any leakage or depression of the ship, and the cruises of the ship in these sights continue normally.
The diver went by Saturday morning to check the ship properly before the ship started to shove off the ground.
For certainty, we are still going to the yard to check that there was no harm, says Syrjä.
Syrjä believes that next M/S Tampere, next weekend, a busted cruise can be handled in an agreed manner.
The cruise period of the ship will continue until the day of independence.
Do not use in ambush
The rescue facility received an alarm on Saturday night a little after 12.
Ambulants were alerted to the port of Vialia to receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use for ambulants.
The day-to-day firemaster Matti Willman told me late tonight that the evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and the wind.
After half three hours on Sunday night, the Pirkanmaa Rescue Agency informed that all those on board the ship had been evacuated and that the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser built in 1957 has been upgraded in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's judge's candidate for anger and drunkenness may be out of office.
Brett Kavanaugh, a judge of the Supreme Court of the United States, may well be absent from the post he seeks, assesses Director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Political Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior at school.
According to Aolla, doubts have brought so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up presenting another person.
In the United States, it has happened that the presidential candidate for a judge of the Supreme Court has raised many conflicts.
In this case, the judge's candidate has usually withdrawn himself, Aaltola says.
This is how the President has been able to keep his face.
The name would rain on the lare of the Democrats
The U.S. Supreme Court seeks to be above politics, but at least in the case of Kavanaugh, the choice of a new judge has become a very politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, according to Aaltola, the decision will likely rain into the Democratic Party in the forthcoming elections to the Congress.
It would raise the enthusiasm for voting among young people and women who would more likely vote for democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the highest court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for appointment every presidential term, for judges of the Supreme Court in the United States are appointed as lifelong.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70 to 80 years of age.
Some of the Republicans even hesitate to name
The candidates for judges of the Supreme Court of the United States will normally be made a background statement, Aaltola states.
Although Trump has only assigned a week's time limit to the FBI's further investigation, Aaltola still says it can bring out something essential.
Yeah, it might bring you.
"The most rare is smoke without fire," says Aaltola.
According to Aolla, it is at least certain that the suitability or inappropriateness of Kavanaugh to office will still be discussed vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a majority of 51-49 votes in the Senate, but at least two women republicans are suspected of considering Kavanaugh's appointment.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the appointment to be taken to the vote and for the Republicans to disappear.
A woman identified as an agent of the military intelligence of the Salisbury suspect.
A Russian woman has told BBC that she has identified Salisbury's poisoning as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service of a suspected Russian man.
On the basis of photographs, the woman told me that this is the military intelligence of Anatoli Tshepiga working in the GRU.
Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia reported earlier that they revealed another of the suspected men poisoned to Chepiga.
Earlier, they said that they found evidence that men's current identities are covert personalities.
The BBC group travelled near the Far East to the village of the border between Russia and China, where Tshepiga grew.
A woman in the village recognized the pictures published by the young Tshepigan Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from the pictures of the British police who appeared as Ruslan Boshirov.
Russians are suspected of poisoning the former dual agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter in the Novitshok nerve poison in March.
Skripals survived.
Colonel Tshepiga has been rewarded, among other things, by the Russian hero's honour mark in 2014.
Russia is still denying a suspect's GRU connection.
Men suspected of poisoning reported earlier in September that they had been tourists in Salisbury in the Russian television interview.
Elderly in bags of throwing in war reform
There has now been a living example of what the Sipilä government's practical limitations on war reform have meant.
The war services of my municipality of birth, Vaalan, are produced by the municipality of Oulunkaare, whose head of health service has been selected as the former regional director of Attendo in 2016.
The leaders of the municipality will warn the delegation of the change limit.
If war expenditure is now rising, the municipal state aid will be cut in the future.
The city's central directors were alarmed, and most of them are ready for a major structural change in the care of the elderly, which would put an end to the hospital care department of the Health Centre and a small unit of memory nurses.
Household care would be added, which means that the elderly living in the outskirts will be torn by their roots next to the health centre to be treated as a "home".
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay it to customers.
The left wing did not swallow bad preparations, but organized a good public event, which was attended by a lot of family members, caregivers, and also by other parties' representatives.
I presented the war-preparation with the dios of how the municipality of Vaala is treating the elderly at home the most in the whole of the North.
In addition, Carina West was the congressman of the neighbouring municipality.
The local magazine did a big thing about the opportunity, and it lifted the Oulunkaare manufacturers on their backs.
War preparations do not write in any paper that Attendo has built a new hospital in Vaala, which now awaits the empty inhabitants.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers are only talking about service checks, but do not tell us what level of care they receive or what kind of staff structure Attendo will take care of the elderly until they receive care.
Without a nurse?
Namely, health center facilities are stopped because there is no medical emergency.
Attendo will also rely on doctors from the Vala Health Centre.
The illustration of how central government officials rotate with incomplete information and the authorized ones are turned back against the wall by means of a change limit.
This is how the Central Party will wipe out the inhabitants of Vala, for who will remain insecure to live voluntarily if there is a chance to move away.
Was the center one election clause that the whole country should be kept inhabited?
President Erdogan opened a big mob in Columbus
In Germany, in the city of Cologne, thousands of people showed their minds when the visitor of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened up the mosque of Europe's largest.
Several hundred people had been gathered on the beach of the River by the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read in the protesters' signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
Several demonstrations have been held during Erdogan's visit on Thursday and security measures have been strict.
Some 10,000 people were expected to protest, including Turkey's human rights situation, on the streets in Cologne in advance.
The supporters of Erdogan had also gathered in the vicinity of the great chef.
However, the police had isolated the large-area mosque from the environment for safety reasons.
In his aide speech, Erdogan welcomed the success of his German visit and considered it to have strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
On Friday, Erdoga and Merkel pledged to rebuild relations between countries that have significantly deteriorated since the Turkish coup attempt in 2016.
However, Merkel stressed that there are deep disagreements between countries on, inter alia, human rights issues.
Review Surrounds Visit
Both Köln City Director Henriette Reker and North-Westfalen State Prime Minister Armin Laschet withdrew their participation in the opening when the criticism of Erdogan's visit was accelerated.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, told me that he came to an anti-Erdogan demonstration from Switzerland.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed and subdued.
For Erdogan, all that differs from his own thinking is terrorism.
In the last Etap of Erdogan's German voyage in Nordrhein-Westphalia, a significant proportion of the population is Turkish.
In Slovakia, three charges of murder of a journalist
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of the journalist Jan Kuc.
On Friday, the D.A. told me that three people are being charged with the murder of Kuc and this fiancée, as well as other crimes.
Previously this week, the police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot in February with his fiancée in Bratislava.
He had been studying the links between politicians and the Italian Mafia.
The police have suspected murders related to Kuc's investigations.
The case and Kucia's published article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
Distribution of livestock may have problems on Sunday in sparsely populated areas
Because of the fault of the printing, the Karjani will also be forced to mail without address on Sunday.
This may be seen in the distribution of the newspaper in decentralised areas where distribution to joint boxes is required from external memory.
The situation was the same for Saturday, and the problem may continue on Monday.
Postage puts extra newspaper bouquets in the province.
The newspapers of other Finnish subscribers will only be posted separately on Monday.
The distribution of these magazines is significantly delayed.
The water is a Finnish astronaut.
Journalist Arto Nyberg is interviewing us today in his future discussion programme, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio to tell about his coming space trip, which he booked for Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
The price was EUR 151,000, which was needed as a bank loan for payment.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
However, the date of departure has been postponed year after year.
Now it seems that after an unlucky pilot flight, which happened in 2014, and the death penalty, things are in order.
If everything goes well, commercial flights will start again this year or no later than next year.
The number of the water flight is 300, which means that his trip is about one year from the first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and has 5 minutes of unloaded space at a height of 100 km, the Finnish astronaut tells of the future homepage.
At the same address, he's also tasting the need for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel, and I saw it on Star Trek TVs.
Star Wars have been seen, and that's why the idea got caught...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a rude master.
Manchester City continued its unforgettable journey in Valioliga when it landed on Saturday at Brighton's homefield 2-0.
Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero paint syringes, which are the sixth guarantor of the ruling championship team in the season.
Sterling was able to direct his fourth round of the season from a distance to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him at 30 minutes in the back of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own goal to five when he saw with Sterling the Brighton defense in the 65th game minute.
The Argentinean was able to place the 2-0 end-of-the-counter penalty in an easy way.
With six wins and one even game, the city that started the season leads Valioliga 19 points on catches.
However, the less played Liverpool at one match is only one point away.
Liverpool meets on Saturday night in his seventh round of matches with a series of three Chelsea.
Youth Societies Choosed New Leaders in Joensuu
At its closing meeting, the Finnish Youth Societies selected new decision makers for the next three-year period 2019-2020.
Anu Sivonen from High Savo and Vice-President Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme were elected Chairman.
The council was elected by 40 members and 40 alternate members, the Finnish Youth Societies will be informed on Sunday.
The youth group meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and security.
The Youth Society meeting in Joensuu gives three promises in its three-year policy objectives: We keep the doors open for all, and we organize equal hobby activities regardless of the location and background, and we support voluntary activities and people on their own paths of growth, the Finnish Youth Societys will report in their briefing.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikko and amazed Ferrari: "Leave a very important driver"
In the Swiss newspaper Blick's interview with the British driver of Mersu, it was asked whether he believes that the release of Kimi Räikkösen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton the rest of the period.
Hamilton leads the second driver of Ferrari at MM points to Sebastian Vetteli at 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago Ferrari told me that Räikkönen will not continue in the garage next season and at the same time Räikkönen announced his move to Sauber.
Of course, Hamilton doesn't think Räikkönen would hit the gloves in the dish.
I don't think Kimi's changing in the remaining races.
He's an exceptional professional... fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favorite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari will lose a very important driver.
It doesn't make sense to me.
Hamilton has previously told me that Räikkönen has been one of his previews.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreamed of formula one, I played the F1 game at PlayStation all day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season will continue on Sunday at the Russian party competition.
The race starts at 2:00 p.m., leaving Mercedes Valtter Bottas.
The afternoon will follow the race for a moment.
The football championship of the A-Youth SM series became a full farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players' strengths
Soccer boys' top serial level ends on Saturday, when they play the last round of the season.
Before 13:00, the starting points for the championship race were clear: the FC Lahti Academy had enough for the first space in practice to score against Vasa IFK.
In order to revert to the situation in the last round, Ilves in the second championship race must win PK-35 and hope for the loss of the fleets.
However, the Gulf championship was in practice already before the beginning of the hate, as Vasa IFK had arrived only seven players.
If there had been one less, the battle could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
In the meantime, the Gulfs led 7-0.
One reason for the vaasan player loss is that the team has played part of the same A-youth SM series, the P20 series and the Men's Second C section.
Vasa IFK has played in the Second in practice against the fall of the entire season.
On Saturday's 2nd round, Vasa IFK is forced to win the JBK visit and at the same time hopes that Tampere United will lose his own visit to KuFua against Siilinjärvi in Toivala.
The car ended up on its roof in Eno, according to the rescue department, luck was involved.
The passenger car drove out of the road and ended up on Sunday at 9:00 in Eno's Case Warning.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were mildly injured, the rescue department informs.
Good luck with that, it says.
According to the rescue department, the road was wet from the rain.
The police team went to the accident site.
Supo awaits new means of enquiry: equipment purchases and recruits already made, foreign planning does not hinder
According to Deputy Chief Antti Pelttar, the Intelligence Act has been reserved by making equipment contracts and training staff.
With the entry into force of the information laws, the budget should be increased by around EUR 10 million permanently.
The premises of the protection police (support) located on the Helsinki Railway are already fully prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, Vice-President of the Board of Directors, tells the West Media that equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence powers.
Serena Williams is shocking with a video where she sings in topless places, campaigns for breast cancer awareness.
Tennessee Superstar Serena Williams will raise again.
Now he campaigned to raise awareness of breast cancer by publishing in his Instagram account a video where he sings only his hands in front of his breasts, reports the news agency AFP.
The chapter is the 1991 hit of the Australian The Divinyls I Touch Myself.
The video Williams supports the activities of the Australian breast cancer association.
"I voted for the worldwide hit of The Divinyls to remind women of regular self-action [princes] inspections," Williams writes in his Instagram message.
And yes, this put me in the area of discomfort, but I wanted to do it because the subject touches all women of skin colour regardless of the world.
Early detection is all a and o - it frightens many lives.
The Divinyls' second writing is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"He died of breast cancer but gave us a song of hit to remind women to put his health first," Williams says.
The video has now been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early on Sunday morning.
In the video's remarks Williams is praised for courage.

The runway of Corpela ends today: This is how it all ends.
Everything good will end in time.
Today, this is what happens to the home country drama Corpela's alley run, which has been quite held.
The third production season has gone on like hot stones: last week, TV was viewed as a first show of 722 000 Finns.
The peak figures in themselves no longer have any practical significance, as Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkis are not coming forward.
In the final period, the ratio of Jaska and Mirku will be taken again by the ribbon, and I think Jaska's mother will guess what's to come.
Even between Anss and Misha are warm, in the light of recent events just romantic, but then the patterns appear once again Laiho.
The police also have a suspicious position about a man in the bone.
However, no one in your power can predict the fate of Laiho in advance.
Anita, for her part, will hear incredible news.
The last will of the distance comes out, which makes her tears beside her.
After a week, Sunday evenings will continue in the new period of Sorjone.
Corpela's run today on TV1 at 9:05.
Is it worth going to work in a little flu tomorrow?
Here's what you're saying for and against.
The flu season is hot.
A lot of arpoes stay home or not.
However, the shopkeeper should consider whether others should go to infection, for the disease may be contagious even if their symptoms were small.
Sometimes the symptoms of the flu strike suddenly, sometimes they appear in the hives.
In the latter option you may already infect others, even though your own symptoms would seem small, says Prevention publication.
So it's worth staying home?
Prevention indicates that the flu is contagious even when a person has no symptoms.
The virus will be infected for a day before the symptoms begin and thereafter from five days to a week.
Children may infect the disease longer.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or at work.
You can get back to work when the cough slows down and there's no fever anymore, says the medical professor Gregory Poland.
Training should also be avoided.
Too fast to return to the gym slows down recovery.
Also, remember to wash hands, put them in your handkerchief and throw the stick paper into the trash.
Still sick to move?
If you have to leave your home as a sick person, consider using a protective mask.
Maski doesn't keep viruses under control, but keeps the user aware of the area of the head.
Then no fingers will be put on the nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also, sneezing is limited with the mask.
Then how could infection be avoided?
The best way is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, it is difficult to avoid the latter.
For example, in the United States, average people touch their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
The new Miss Finland repeats the missi tradition: "My husband is a hockey player."
The hockey and the misses are often connected.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland's crown has received Alina Voronkova from Pertunma.
She lives in Lahti now, where she moved to when she was 15.
Alina's mother is an Inker Finn and her father is a Russian.
Voronkova was bullied at school about his father's Russianism.
Mom and Dad have moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied by my Russian attitude.
In the customary country, I had no friends at all, Alina will tell you at the Miss Finland semi-finalist publicity event.
After high school, Alina decided to start from a clean table and move to Lahti to go to high school.
Soon, the beauty lady found new friends and the ark left to roll hopefully.
At the age of 15, he thinks he's an adult, but after that, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurrin, who is familiar with the Pelicans lines.
Since the career of the SM League, a hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009 he was on the Finnish team in the 18-year-old MM races.
In the early days of dating, the couple lived in a distance of almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel with her husband to the world.
If I got to the third winner, and with that I'd have a career, I don't want to believe that it would have any effect on our relationship.
Even if we have to live apart, we have good confidence and there is a good side in the distance that it will remain on the top of the whole time, Alina swelled in May.

The restaurant ship M/S Tampere raided the lake on the Pyhäjärve - "Strengthening on the stone"
Inland waterway M/S Tampere drove off late Friday night at Akaalla on Pyhäjärve.
The rescue facility received an alarm from the water traffic accident on Friday night after half a dozen.

Now they're being transferred on a bus ride to Tamperetta, said Chief of Staff Jari Nieminen STT at 1 p.m. at night.
In the port of Viiala, ambulances were alerted to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, a ship travelling from the Stargate to Tampere had departed from the narrow west of the Jumusensalm.
The police will find out what happened.
The day-to-day firemaster Matti Willman told me earlier this evening that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the dark and fairly hard wind.
According to the rescue agency, the fate of the ship is unclear.
Apparently, the ship's not bleeding.
After the evacuation operation, dives will begin to check the situation at the bottom.

Ex-managers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius.
The fight against Erkan Teper by Robert Helenius's fight is shagging the money.
Today the evening-Sanomas news the boxing manager Jaakko Helmisen and Vice-President Jussi Kokkila filed a challenge application in which Helenius receives a total of more than EUR 80 000 unpaid managerial fees with late rates.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Heleni 15.4.2014-30.1.2015.
We've tried to settle, but there's no other choice.
This has been a clear mandate, and much work has been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius, today's manager, Markus Sundman, sent the evening magazine with a reply to the boxer's view of the events.
Helenius denies being obliged to pay the required sum.
According to his opposition, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services in a financially difficult situation to Heleni and promised to be able to organize matches and sponsorships for her.
It had been said that Helenius was obliged to pay rewards only in percentages of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius does not have to pay for anything, only to receive the income they have arranged.
This is also a normal and unique practice in the management of professional athletes.
The work on wages has never been agreed and that would also have been absurd in Helenius' situation, Sundman will find out in his message.
There was never a written agreement on cooperation.
According to his response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on the distribution of income in writing from the outset, but Kokkila and Sundman received the draft until the end of 2014.
For his part, he said that the proposal was poor and broke up cooperation with Kokkila and Helmise.
Helenius didn't fight once when he was dealing with Cokkila and Helmise.
A year after the conclusion of the cooperation, Helenius was shown to have a "individual but sizeable" fall from the work of the manager.
This year, an appeal has been brought against the same arguments.
Helenius sees the aftermath of Helmise and Kokkila as poor, he says.
Helenius meets today with the boxing union in Stuttgart, Erkan Teper, in Stuttgart, on the seventh challenger list of the IBF's heavy series.
A heartfelt man and a good journalist
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio editor and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
At the age of 83, the radio editor and journalist Erkki Pälli died of unhealthy liver cancer.
The runner's death report was published on Sunday in Helsinki.
The report reports that Päll died on 3 September.
Pälli told me about serious illness on his Facebook site in March 2018.
The publication also saw Ile Vainio, who knew that fate was sad.
He left Facebook earlier, as if he said goodbye, Ile Vainio says.
The vanity sees Erkki Päll as a gifted expert who became a great reporter.
He's remembering that Päll was a man with fast hoses and funny things.
I learned how to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finnlev and started there as a storekeeper.
That's when we met Erk.
He was then a Finnlev's informant and in different tasks, Ile Vainio remembers.
As a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a standard publisher at all parties, making stories about artists.
He was always expert and I saw how great a fire he had for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he went straight to the skin of his interviewers.
He was a heartfelt man and a good reporter.
To many he became acquainted with as a radio editor of Yle, but he also wrote great news stories.
Erkki interviewed me many times too.
He was good at talking.
Over the decades, Pälli worked in addition to the journalist's work in Fazer-disk company with Hope Kärje.
He was a music producer on Vesa-Matti Loir's records.
However, the greatest passion for Päll was radio work in which he had his own style.
Since the 1960s, he did radio work, and he became acquainted with numerous listeners at the Yle ether.
Rolli retired in 1998.
On Saturday, the Finnish Ski Federation reported that the year ended in May showed some EUR 450 000 profits.
The alliance describes the "full translation" of its economic situation, although the economy is certainly burdened by the "significant debt in the balance sheet".
CEO Mika Kulmala welcomes rapid response and strict economic discipline.
Last autumn, we reacted to the situation as quickly as possible by taking adaptation measures.
The careful planning and economic management of the operation has hit through our entire organization, Kulmala tells us in the press.
We have also succeeded well in acquiring partners and, in addition, the world's yield was the maximum in the past competition period.
However, in the future, cost management must also be careful, and at the same time we must continue to look for new financial models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Ten bodies lie in the backyard of the hospital in Palu, in the island of Sulawes, Indonesia.
Only one building separates them from the area where injured survivors have been gathered to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also treated outside because of post-strikes.
One of those who moved in the hospital area was a 52-year-old returnees from Baharudd who were looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
I spoke to him last time he was going to school, Baharuddin told the news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris was lying in the courtyard of the Army Hospital in Palu, which has had injuries in his back and arm.
He was in a local hotel with his wife and daughter at the start of the earthquake.
The family was invited to the wedding party of Return.
I probably got under the wall that collapsed in the compressions.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what's happened to him and my child.
I hope they're safe, told Haris' news agency AP according to British media.
Small stores are robbed.
The mother of a 35-year-old baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm down her feverish baby.
He described the moods in the city as tense.
There's little clean water.
"Small shops are robbed everywhere," Kusuma said.
Many of Palu's residents have slept outside or in temporary bamboo houses.
Even if the house was somehow up, possible post-storms could destroy it forever and bury the inhabitants.
According to AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palu prison fled after the prison walls collapsed.
The prisoners were known to be about 560, so there are possibly about 300 escapers.
Also, some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners became angry and lit the prison fire after the guards had banned them from searching for their relatives suffering from earthquake and tsunami.
The airport of return has been reopened mainly for subsidisation flights.
Among the first ones, an army C-130 transport aircraft landed on the field, bringing back aid supplies.
Commercial flights to the Palau field are only permitted limitedly.
The pilots will have to land on the ground without the help of the airline, because the tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
The rain wipes over Finland at night
The entire earth will spread over Sunday night westwards, a long rainy area, reports the Institute of Air Science.
The rain comes mostly in water, but there's a rhino or snow to be expected in Central and North Lapland.
The last night's sparks of packaging are not repeating because the temperatures below the cloud cover remain higher.
The cloudy night keeps the lowest temperatures pretty efficiently under control.
In the west, you can take a glazed side, said the emergency meteorologist Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rainy area will flee eastwards along the morning.
In the south and west, there are rivers or half clouds.
In the afternoon, temperatures will always move to the height of Oulu at 10-13 degrees.
The beginning week for temperatures seems similar in the southern and middle parts of the country, but the weather becomes more unstable.
Sea areas have wind and wave warnings in place.
In the coming days there are no real storms to be expected, but otherwise there is typically different weather in the autumn.
Ilkka said it's the fall that's starting to slap on, Ilkka.

Russian father Dimitri and Indian mother Svetlana believed their daughters were successful at the Miss Finland Final.
The recent parents of Miss Finland, Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were proud to follow the first moments of their daughter at the end of the crown.
They arrived in the audience from Pertunma and were going to drive back home after the final.
It's a wonderful mood!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before the arrival, she started to get excited, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is an Indian and Dimitri is a Russian.
Alina speaks smooth Russian, even though she has lived throughout her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana tells me that when she was a little girl, she was more interested in acting and in many other things than missing a career.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should start being a mistress.
But he said he wanted to be a radio editor.
Only later was Alina excited about the beauty contests.
The parents' hope was that Alina would get to college before participating in the Miss Finland competition.
That was the case, and finally Alina still wanted to take a degree before the mischievous.
We already asked why he didn't take part last year, but he wanted to finish it.
Parents believe that Alina won the competition because it is a healthy example for young people and adults.
He's doing a lot of sports and eating healthy.
And Alina likes to be on the spot.
Alina's boyfriend Joonas Hurri is hockey at work in Japan, and he didn't get to Finland to encourage his love in the final.
Alina's parents believe that the young people's relationship is going to last a long time.
Yes, that's what I'm supposed to do!
The parents were hoping that the daughter would be here soon.
Now it's been such a long break on the tours for the Missikiirs.
I'm already sorry, even though there's been some messages.

Sari Piippo left his career in Brussels and became a home mother in Finland - he thought of the idea of a comic book: the lack of drawing skills did not slow down
Once my husband's statement, where he proposed it as a person in the story I developed, the Espoo comic bookwriter, the mother-in-law and the former EU translator, Sari Piippo, left.
Sari Piippo reports that he was an EU translator of economic and legal matters in Brussels until after the fourth child, the family became a returnee ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a homemother so well.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point it came to mind that what it would do when the youngest child was already big.
Then the 2014 picture came in a comic book.
Piippo tells me he never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read Aku Duck, Tint, and Asterix from a small age.
I had drawn the last time I was a child, but when these more Organic manuscripts began to be born, the situation changed.
First, I made a few dozen scripts in the desk box.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (s. 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I couldn't get her attracted until summer 2016, when I donated Long drawings with the help of the drawing disc.
His zeal lasted a ten-year strip, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Pippo, who says the drawing disc was a great encouragement to him.
The drawing disc is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something early.
On paper, I didn't even try to draw, tells Piippo about his relationship, which he usually draws at night.
Manuscripts pop up all the time, but usually I don't make ready at once.
One of the three screens takes more than an hour.
I might do a screen at a time and I'd love to play with colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest because drawing is not my strongest species.
Sari Piippo says he appreciates the current films of newspapers, including Scott Adams Dilbert.
More organic people are a carrot-in-law mother with a salad haircut.
Other people are Man, Pissis and Twins.
More organic in the world, man is what he eats.
The ideas of the series come from your own life and social media.
Sari Piippo doesn't want to preach or offer a bottle of force, even though he's in the middle of the thing.
Pippo tells me he's reading his series with his husband and his children.
It's such a great feeling when you look at the comic book that you're drawing and you're saying that this is what I've done today.
And enough challenges for my mother!

The 21-year-old flight leader Anthonius Gunawan Agung has become a hero of the Indonesian earthquake.
Agung remained alone in the tower until hundreds of passengers transported safely from the island shaken by the earthquake.
The young man was in turn at the airport of Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie, in the city of Palu, when the earthquake hit Friday.

Rehn wondered about Europe's conclusion to the trade war: "We have to look at the following tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire world economy.
All over Europe, growth forecasts have been calculated and Finland's Bank has also slightly reduced its own economic growth estimates.
The Director-General Olli Rehn said at Yle's first meeting that while the tightening tension does not have a direct impact on European trade flows, it undermines confidence, which in turn reflects the investment decisions of companies.
The situation also applies to the export of Finnish companies.
So far, Rehn believes that Europe is well-functioning.
It has been able to build an intermediate peace with the United States and has also contributed to calming the situation with China and Japan.
In Rehn's view, Europe does not seem to flourish in the foot of the trade war.
I have to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have an unpredictable partner in Washington's direction, however, he said in the Yle interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is the third largest national economy in the euro area, Italy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and in the Western world as a whole.
Yesterday, the market reacted strongly to the deficit budget clearly presented by the Italian Government on Thursday night.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4 per cent of the national product.
Rehn thinks the situation in Italy is worrying.
Five per cent of the country's lending stock is credits in difficulty and unorganized credits are more than ten per cent.
In addition, its public finances are weak, and the country seems to go beyond its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps it is not worth painting new crises yet, Rehn responded when asked if Italy was going to the new economic crisis in Europe.
The second issue facing Europe is the difference between Britain and the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be in agreement.
The disputed separation would be much more negative.
Rehn started as Finland's Bank's Executive Director in July.
Mario Draghi, Director-General of the European Central Bank (ECB), withdraws from his duties in just a year's time.
The debate on his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor, Erkki Liikanen, have been whispering in speeches.
I'm sure it's okay if the Finnish names are involved, Rehn said and added that he's not going to comment on this further.
HS super-recommended Black Box shows will continue again next week - the last tickets to Helsinki are being sold
The recommendations of Helsinki's Says will continue again in the week.
Other presentations will be seen in the National Theatre on 2 October, 8 October and 11 October.
October 23, the Black box will be visiting Tampere for the first time.
There are still some tickets for the National Theater.
The Tampere show has been sold out.
Tickets sell Flag.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers on the stage will report a long-term faction that has not been published in any HS instrument.
There's another thing nobody's ever heard of.
"A strange spy at night in Helsinki, an impressive report from across the globe and a story about a very topical health issue," says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet HS suppliers and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsinki's Sayms have arranged a live journalism night for three years.
They have been popular and often sold out from the outset.
There's been more than 15,000 people in the viewhouse.
The black box was rewarded at Bonnier as a journalist for the year.
The rewarders thanked the new way to make journalism and the journalists want to come close to their readers.
Spring 2019 Black box will be seen in the National Theatre in March-April.
The show is also visited in Tampere and Turku.
At that time, the present presentation has different contents than in the present autumn.
The missing mushroom was found because of "unpredictable experiment"
The drone-knowledge of the Finnish police is the top of the world: "We are being asked about training"
According to the Director of the Police College, the police can use drone in addition to the search for missing persons, for example, in criminal investigations and intelligence.
The Oulu police managed to find a missing mushroom drone in Rahae in just a couple of minutes.
Director Kimmo Himberg of the Police College tweeted the case and mentioned, among other things, that "through unpredictable experimentation and effective training we are at the forefront of the world as well."
Drone is quite a new captivity, and even more new in police duties.
There are no statistics on the fact that the Finnish police would be the master of drone use.
According to Himberg, there is a strong belief that this is the case.
This has emerged, for example, when the experience of the Finnish police has been reported in international events.
There is a terrible interest in it elsewhere, Himberg says.
It would be hard for visitors to watch the drone operation of the Finnish police.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting more common
Mr Himberg recalls that finding a missing person in Finland's winter conditions as soon as possible is very important.
As noted, the missing person in Raahe was found using drone in only a couple of minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drones.
Himberg says they're going to be trained more.
A lot of drone is already being used in police duties, and their use is becoming widespread and increasing in the future.
That's how I dare say, Himberg tells me.
In addition to the search for missing persons, the police, according to Himberg, can use drones, for example, in the investigation of an accident or crime scene, and in certain types of intelligence.
For example, we already need to check some area a little longer, where it is possible to fear that there will be violence.
Drone can then be used for pre-information.
Karjalan Rugby got up to the number one.
Karelia Rugby celebrates the victory of the 2nd division on Saturday in Kuopio.
The Joensus were still in the middle of the match with 7-12 deaths at the Helsinki Rugby Club, but they found a plot in the second cycle and sequestered the guests of the south 26-12.
At the same time, the 2-divisional championship knew Karelia Rugby's historic rise to the 1-divisional.
Previously, the company had played in number one, but at that time the Finnish rugby series had been divided into two levels, the SM series and several sections of 1 division.
The company is going to take the serial place, but it knows a lot of work next winter.
The current 20-player roster must be raised to 25.
As a division, you also know the increase in the number of games and longer gaming trips, so you also have to keep your money on it.
Eatcaniemi starts the season in Montreal, strengthens the main coach
The head coach Claude Julien, who plays Montreal Canadiens in the NHL of the hockey, confirmed the company on Twitter account that the Finnish attacker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super-promise for Eatkaniemen, 18, on the first round of three summer bookings.
The attacker joined the Montreal exercise strength from the end of the summer and has presented strong samples in the September exercises.
The eagle was immediately successful in his first exercise match to paint.
Chief Coach Julien said that the Finn had taken a big step in the development after he arrived in the camp.
The NHL series starts next week against Thursday night in Finland.
Montreal meets in the opening round of Toronto Maple Leafs.
What's a good leader?
This week, Finland has spoken a lot about leadership.
Risto Siilasmaa, president of Nokia's government, told HS' interview about his book Paranoide optimistically, where he illuminates leadership in his philosophy.
At the same time, he criticizes the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollila.
Ollila strongly contested the allegations, but in previous Nokia's explanations there have been talks about the inability of leaders to act as a team; fear and innocence, which in all respects caused a collapse in mobile business.
The risk-taking and agility of the company's rising phase disappeared.
This week, in Helsinki, a giant business event was also held in the Nordic Business Forum, which brought the Finnish business cream to Messukeskus.
In addition to Barack Obama, the main star of the 12 business world rose to the stage.
That's enough talk about good leadership.
The Legend of Leaders Gary Hamel said that a good leader has to dare to take the company to the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most intellectually linked to decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of the Whole Foods trade chain from a wide range of organics, said that the director needs to know how to communicate to the entire staff with the company's purpose.
And that's not just the purpose of winning the owners.
Susan Cain, of the introverts of the book of success, said that the most successful leaders are studying humility.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
Often they're introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a financial sector professor, recalled that the qualities of a good leader must be combined with the life cycle of the company.
At the start of the company, the manager must be able to tell a story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that grows to a mature phase needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons at the Nordic Business Forum listened to 7,500 visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
As a danger, they had a flash of information.
A good leader is demanding a lot.
That is why leadership is so often wrong, even at the highest level.
There were also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They used to talk to each other in a comrade.
However, they hardly wondered whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to assess.
Sara Chafak arrived on a great red carpet directly from Los Angeles to spend most of his year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Missifinal in a wonderful black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland's show dress also had a pizza lacquer.
A little jet lag.
I came back from Los Angeles.
For a long time, I spend most of my time there, Chafak tells me about his news.
Chafak tells me he's going to L.A.
He's been doing commercials, among other things.
Working in the United States he describes as interesting, and also similar to in Finland.
However, he says that work needs to be done more harder, for the model work is always easy to replace.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, says Chafak.
Choreographer for Sonya Lindfors EUR 30 000 live art prize in Kuopio
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural prize in Kuopio on Saturday.
Lindfors, awarded the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works on choreography, community activity and teaching.
The art of Sonya Lindfors is vital to its surrounding environment.
His work gives other people the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in the environments in which they have previously been lacking, describing the winner.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were candidates for the award.
The prize is distributed annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group in the field of live art.
The Danish police found a big Volvo wanted in the operation, "We can't tell you where."
The extensive searches by the Danish police have produced results.
At the beginning of the operation, the traffic was closed on the bridges of Juutinrauma and Big Belt.
All land and ferry transport from the island of Sjaland was closed to Sweden, Germany and other Denmark.
The police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
IS reached the Deputy Chief of the Copenhagen Police Media Centre.
We've found the car we found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm, about the police in Copenhagen, will tell you about the Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo wanted has no direct contact with the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet told me about the police briefing on Saturday.
Director Jørgen Bergen Skov was responsible for the cost of the shutdown operation.
He didn't want to tell me what the criminal name was.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to people's lives.
Three people have been searched for in the operation.
The police won't tell us if they're already caught.
According to the newspaper, the restrictions on ship transport have been withdrawn.
The Copenhagen police also followed events in their Twitter account.
However, according to the police, the public no longer has cause for concern, as the threat was directed against certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades to differ - now the people vote on it in the controversial elections
Macedonia in the Balkans is currently voting on the proposal for a new name for the country.
According to the Agreement between Macedonia and the Greek Governments, it would be called the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has hindered the efforts of Macedonia to become a member of NATO and the EU so far.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The question of the national vote does not mention a new name, but asks whether the voter supports the EU and NATO membership of Macedonia by adopting the agreement.
The vote began at least at a school in the center of the capital of Skopje.
The retired nurse Olivera Argiosvka, who voted at school, wished to support the agreement.
The referendum is a change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
In 1991, the name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official contacts.
The Government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned in favour of the adoption of the agreement.
The national right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has also called for a referendum to be boicotized.
In addition to the result, there is enough excitement to the fact that the vote will increase by more than 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but the victory of yes-voting would allow the mandate to change the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of Parliament is required to change the Constitution.
The agreement still needs to be adopted by the Greek Parliament.
Voting places will be closed at 8 p.m. in Finland.
That's a beautiful victory!
Robert Helenius smashed Erkan Teper.
Robert Helenius met late Saturday night at Erkan Teper's heavy professional boxing game in Germany.
A 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent in Waldenbuch, in Stuttgart's cup.
The main event of the evening was the IBF union's heavy series of Intercontinental titles.
Its winner may be given the opportunity to be able to fight on Saturday in harder tasks with considerable financial significance.
Helenius solved the match in the eighth round when he smashed Teper with a hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
"Nordic Nightmare" already hurt his opponent in the third round, when the German nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight already in December 2015.
That's when Teper appealed to an injury and retired from the game.
After that, it became apparent that the German had been drooling twice in the doping test.
Helenius has taken his name from his professional career for 28 matches and suffered two losses.
Teper, who was clearly a favorite in the match, has won 19 professional matches in his career and lost three times.
With the Hamilton deposit order to win, the difference was already 50 points.

Canada fights time to reach a settlement with Nafta USA
Time will threaten to end in negotiations between the United States and Canada on the free trade agreement in Nafta.
The United States has set the back line on Sunday, and country negotiators have discussed closely throughout the weekend.
Canada's main adviser, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly in order to focus on trade negotiations in full.
Following President Donald Trump's demand, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to reform the North American Free Trade Agreement on Nafta.
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States made a deal with each other, but Canada's agreement has not yet been established.
The United States and Mexico want to enter into force the agreement before the Mexican presidential elections won by Andres Manuel López Obrador will take office at the beginning of December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed the Congress that the plans are to sign the agreement at the end of November - whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready on Sunday in order to allow sufficient time for the US Congress to assess it.

I wasn't there, but what I saw from the pictures, so the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the rustling on the field.
There has been no criminal report as a result of the events.
The tablestone has shaken butterfly bathing in its SE time in the worldcup, Laukkanen also swims in the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi have advanced to the finals of the World Cup of swimming 3/7 competitions in the Netherlands.
Kisses are swimming in Eindhoven on a short track.
HSS's Pöytäkivi shocked Finland's record in 50 meters of butterfly baths, where he was the second in the early 22.82.
Previously in September Tablestone swims in Helsinki for the SE time 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Liukonen, representing the Espooese, was 24th in the 24th season of butterfly bathing.
The Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was at the start of the 50-metre breast baths in the sixth in the 30.48 time and went to the final.
At the beginning of two hundred yards of mixing, Laukkanen was 15th in the time of 2.14.25.
Students play a rare delight: Ancient Tragedy - Simplified Orestes influences their visuality
Ancient tragedies are rarely delightful at Finnish scenes.
For example, the National Theatre has recently seen the tragedy of ancient times, Sofokleen Filoktetes, in 1988.
Now the Theatre College brought to the tour from the National Theatre the only theatrical trilogy that was preserved in ancient times, Aiskylus Orestesia.
At the start of 2015 Lavat Open! projects Theatre College actor students work with professional director internationally.
This fourth project, as the first one, is the director of Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia received its international first night in Berlin in April.
The agreement on Orestesia will summarise the report on the end of the blood offense of the Atreus family condemned to destruction and the birth of the rule of law to twenty minutes, particularly by the consolidation of choir parts.
The work succeeds in being very faithful to the spirit of the fine tribute of Kirsti Simonsure (2003).
Dramatic lights and pages of the theatre showcase highlight a simplified and bright scenery thinking.
At its centre there is a dynamic between choir-releasing actors who play roles and choir-releasing actors.
The show uses both double and triple screenings of roles.
Actors do not leave the scene at all, so the murders of Agamemnon and the warship of Trojan, for example, are shown at the scene, unlike the ancient showstrade.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize that it is faithful to the ancient showstradition.
Rather, before the viewer's eyes, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created, which is constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing together an arrhythmic group of actor students in the master's field as a close group, in fact as one organism.
Especially in choir parts, very expressive, sculpture-sculpted group formations, actors are able to reach their rights at a bare level, only by decorating a white enclosure, on the stage.
Impressive.
Oresthesia's performances continue at Kouvola and Oulu's Theater.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first hydrocarbon truck

With this quality of the world's first project, we are moving further than fuel cell technology.
We are also constantly looking for opportunities to expand the market area of these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the tank network, Vice President of Hyundai Motor In Cheol Lee said the agreement at the publication event.
The nyrks burst on several occasions in Kajaan
A little over thirty men assaulted three men in a restaurant in central Kajaan and on Saturday morning.
He first hit one man inside the restaurant, resulting in his removal from the place.
Outside he pushed another man into the ground, and in the absence of a third man, the aggressor still hit him.
The police caught the aggressor.
By police station, a man was still aggressive and kicked another policeman's leg.
He also threatened the police by assaulting and killing.
The man was taken to the prison to calm down.
The matter will be investigated in three cases of assault and in the form of violent opposition by the official.
In the centre of Kajaan, there was also another assault on the middle street on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a 20-year-old cajanian man hit the victim.
A little later, another man dumped him in the ground, and the man who beat him in the past kicked the victim again.
The outsiders took the aggressors away from the victim, and the police were called there.
However, the perpetrators have already had time to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajaan police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail to investigate.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
Long line radio editor Erkki Pälli is dead.
As a long-term journalist, Erkki Pälli died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio editor Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of unhealthy liver cancer, which he reported on his Facebook site in March 2018.
It's all right. It's all right.
The doctor has said that, I live day by day, he commented on his situation to the evening magazine a month ago.
The security of trade aunts and seeds must be guaranteed
For the first time, I got paid in 1984.
When this year's tire makes an issue amazed, it's usually about the big news.
When I wrote (Carrian, 27.9.) about the insecurity of retail trade workers, I was amazed and momentarily even a little angry.
I also spoke about the case by the professional environmental expert Erika Kähärää of the Trade Union of Services (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers of course claim otherwise.
There are only clearly serious cases in which police are informed, and many of the actual violence remains unreported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to statify their close-up situation on the basis of the Labour Safety Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and are not collected at all," he said.
I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know.
Violence has always been the problem that they do not always cause physical injury.
However, psychological trauma can be much more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to draw a distinction between the violence situation and the threatening violence situation when even a certain level of aggressive threats must be counted as violence - even if there is no access to them.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs, even if the actual act is not done.
Some areas of residence are restless.
The store's got some guards.
As the opening times of the shops were released, there was also a rather high level of openness in the media from its impact on the safety of the sellers.
"At that time, many employers organized security services for at least nighttime feelings and to prevent work alone," Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, the wrong conclusion is made.
This would now seem to have been an effective effect, but this will produce a new negative trend.
As a result of security, the situation of disturbance remained well under control, a picture emerged that security would be unnecessary.
Now, in many places, attempts are being made to find solutions that could eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offence, and it is quite understandable that a seller who has been abused does not want to make an investigation request for a criminal who usually lives near the market.
But the same, according to the 2011 Act, mild assault becomes subject to the prosecution if it occurs at the workplace.
I think there's a need for precedents now.
When the next time she's a business aunt, or she's being assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor's charges.
When the court would put a few of the aggressors in prison, and the sentence there from the hard end of the penalty scale, the habits would be cleaned up.
A society where the food trade needs to be open in small towns for almost a day must guarantee the safety of trade workers.
Heidi Sohlberg signed to misses before the start of the direct broadcast, "Sarah, Iiro is then married."
Miss's crowning this year is not seen as a traditional way on TV, but is shown by the Viafree website.
The broadcast is hosted by former Miss Heidi Sohlberg and by the host of Viasatin and Viaplay NHL and KHL studios Iiro Harjula.
Backstagen and the red carpet are the planner of Janni Hussi.
Before the direct broadcast, the composer three informed the arrival guests and media representatives of the cost of the broadcast.
Initially, Sohlberg asked the public to give Harjula a hard applause.
Now all the women are screaming!
Now, look at this man-runner, Sohlberg glittered his colleagues when the audience was cheering.
Eturial games are followed by many of the previous years Miss Finland.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next door and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg blossomed in the direction of Sara.
The more likely Sohlberg referred to the just divorced Siep, who laughed at the comment, even though it seemed confused at first.
The seed spoke of his divorce for the first time in the weekend of the Saarlands.
Missikaunotar told me that she did not want to open up the reasons for the divorce more closely in the public, because it is a matter between her and Roope Salmis.
He said he's not busy with a new relationship, but he's going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own things, and especially I'm starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi told me.
Harjula's marriage status came up at a later stage when Sohlberg accidentally mistakenly called Janni Huss and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The runner-thirty laughed at the mess.
Iiro was married or how did it go?
Janni Hussi signed the mess.
The Northman tortured his unmarried mate by cutting, burning and feeding powerful sauce
The Northern Land district court has condemned a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola for a large number of crimes committed against his single spouse for three years in prison.
The instrument of crime was, inter alia, belt, cable and straps.
The court condemned these objects to the state as being lost.
The rar's charge was about a suspect's gross rape.
However, the court dismissed this charge.
The charge of Kokkola was four assaults, brutal assault, enforcement, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty, and two damages.
The crimes occurred between 26 March and 24 May last.
At the end of the last deeds, the man was captured and imprisoned a few days later.
On Thursday, the district court of Northland issued its sentence and ordered a 34-year-old to continue to be held in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-olds were also accused of two gross violations of liberty and of the brutal rape that took place on 22 May.
However, these charges were rejected as untrue.
The case was dealt with behind closed doors in court.
However, the verdict was made publicly available.
According to the trial judge, the accused had committed violence, threat and force against his spouse in situations where he had been bound.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, burned with a cigarette, fed a strong sauce and poured water and coffee on it.
In its judgment, the court ordered the state to be penalized by means of a belt and a cable, a sleeve, a bathtub belt, a knife and a water supply.
Four Witnesses
According to law, the parties continued their co-life between actions.
It can be read from the judgment that a large part of the most brutal acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men were heard in court.
A 34-year-old should pay compensation for pain, pain, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5800.
That is hardly the money he has, because the convicted person already has debts of his old age in his inheritance.
The prison sentence is not the first man.
The afternoon doesn't tell us the name of the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
A fresh verdict is not lawful when it comes to writing this.
Europe under four points to the Ryder Cup solution
On Saturday, European golf professionals imprisoned their leadership in a traditional hole game against the United States.
Europe is leading the Rider Cupia game in Paris at 10-6 points, while there are still 12 double games on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four 4-ball matches that began Saturday, and the 4-game wins in the afternoon were equal to 2-2.
The leading European stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four games they played during Friday and Saturday.
In the past, no European couple had succeeded.
On Sunday, the Twelfth is looking for more history.
No European player has won five points in the Ryder Cup together, nor has it been achieved by three players from the Americans: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
H.J.K. condemns his supporters' heavy harassment at the Honka game: "Austria is not part of football."
On Sunday, the football team HJK published a press release condemning the disruption of its supporters in the Saturday FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We regret the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters," the report states.
After the match ended, some 50 HJK supporters rushed into the field and some seemed to try to challenge a fight with Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers did not calm down the situation, but the police and the Knights were needed.
HJK informs us that team players and employees are shocked about what happened.
The events after the match are not in line with the values of our 111-year-old company.
"We are firmly denying all activities that endanger the security of events," the bulletin states.
HJK promises to help the authorities and organizers of the event in solving safety-threatening factors and eliminating mild events.
Supporting culture is a part of football and an important issue for HJK.
We support positive, happy and encouraging activities in football viewpoints in every way.
"It's not an issue," says the press.
The filipino inventor is flying with a drone car.
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Peloton.
He now belongs to a growing crowd in the world who swears to have invented a flying car or at least his own version of it.
As competitors, for example, he has factors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not believe in the mass production of his equipment.
According to reports from the world, a man has spent much of his property on building his dreams.
Six years ago, he started flying his car.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says that he made the first successful test flight, he slipped on his device at a height of over seven meters.
One of his objectives was to avoid traffic concussions.
I hope the device raises positive reactions.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Tomorrow's work-fighting activities will be seen in children's day care and social and health services
In public and well-being tomorrow, the bans on overwork and shifting will be shown in particular in social and health services and day care for children, the JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine will assess.
The effects will be extensive, and they will certainly be seen in such a way that there is not enough staff there.
Everyone's gonna have to figure out how to pick up their kids.
The employer's task now is to ensure that the services play and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the shortage of workers was also apparent at the beginning of the year when JHL members were over-working and exchange bans due to contractual negotiations.
Employers have made it possible, through the flexibilitys, that staff have not been hired, but that workers have been overworked or shifted.
This isn't a work action yet.
It is perfectly normal for each worker to be concerned about regular working hours and only to be done.
JHL opposes the government's intentions to reduce the protection of small firms' termination.
Markku Jalonen, Director of Employment of Municipal Employers, does not undertake to pre-evaluate the effects of overworking and shift bans.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, even though they may be weakened.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and made preparations for what is to be done.
The region is so broad, social and health activities and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary greatly by industry, region and employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that experience has already been gained last week, including the Association of Near and Basic Nurses for the three-day activities of Super and Tehy's Social and Health Professional Association.
Their effects were quite minor.
The JHL ban on overworking and shifting concerns, inter alia, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day nurses are excluded.
The fight at this stage involves almost 100 000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laki, JHL's activities may last for a long time.
The Federation is also prepared for other work-fighting measures if the preparation of the redundancy law continues.
The government should now admit that I'm running to the wall and hard.
The nobles think that both the Ay movement and the government must come against it.
It is special that the hard ones are already in the pipe, even though the performance has not been given yet, Jalonen will update.
Great Coralism is born with the strength of children and adults in the gymnasiums of studying the gestures of the raisin and the sea horse
In the other spaces, the Great Korallirius received its first night in Hamburg last spring and last Saturday it was presented for the second time in Finland, this time in Cannelhouse.
Like previous works of the group, Great Corality is a work that will be built from the beginning to the end together with the public.
This time, however, a clearer border show is also being built, which refreshes and glosses the observations made in the initial exercises.
There's plenty of random magic in the theatre clubs for children.
The child's perspective has already been included in the preparation phase.
The great Korallirius, however, is not a child's performance, but a performance that adults and children do in co-operation.
It gives adults information and observations on the way in which children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to throw themselves into exercises and joint plays also connects the distance between adults and children.
The great Korallirius is a bit like satubalet, fitness and nature-related consciousness, but it is finally flirting in different, non-human conditions around visits.
The great Coralism begins with the acquaintance of coral and coral bodies and fish business lines.
The six different fitness circles teach the gestures of the wilderness and the sea horse.
Finally, there is a short hour performance where music, lights and bright paints and costumes help to get to know the life of the coral.
In the Great Coral, there are both diving people who watch the life of the Coral, and the corals that are being considered.
In addition, there are bodies that look at corals.
Looks and observations in a number of directions make the show dense and stunning.
Whether one's landscape, one's landscape, one's landscape, and another's landscape, and all this at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult for children at all.
In other spaces, the group is seeking to practice at the border of thought and action, to which access when the group consists of both children and adults is challenging.
On the other hand, the involvement of children makes it more important.
After the workshop, Sitrator will hold a quiet demonstration for the endangered corals.
The destructions beyond man's understanding should not be allowed to be hardened, even if it might be difficult to understand how important it is to exercise compassion before the prospects of destruction.
In other areas it has built its work so that it respects the diversity of life also with political gesture.
There are other generations, there are other kinds of consciousness, other species, and the future generations whose wonders and plays it cleans up.
The kids grow up too fast. I'm happy that there were no smart phones in my childhood.
Today, children and young people are more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking as younger and younger.
I think children should be children all their childhood, and not mess their lives up because of victories and sex, because others say they're doing that.
I was amazed when my friend told me he had to pick up his sister in fifth grade in the "boyfriend" weekend.
When he came to pick up his drunken sister, this was about his sex experiences that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned all our childhood that we can't touch defeats and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood, and they will not need to grow up too early because of the group pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing in Instagram even younger girls who are in their pictures on makeups in the face and reveal clothes on their faces.
Snapchat is used to take and send illustrations at night.
It's harder for girls to figure out how old they are.
Nowadays, 13 years of age can easily look like 18 years old and older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad there were no smartphones in my childhood.
I had to be a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people think about me.
General: Authorities informed the State Department that the Airiston Helmi case does not relate to national security
According to Ilkka Kanerva, Ilkka interviewed, the protection police and the defence forces visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation of Airiston Helmen is currently not related to national security, but to organised crime, Yle says.
Information from anonymous sources was confirmed by Mr Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee (Cok).
According to Canerva, the defence forces and the protection police visited the Committees of Defence and Foreign Affairs this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily economic crime.
They were very strict that they did not speculate that there was something else, Kanerva commented in the Higher interview.
According to more information, no evidence of the link to national security has been found to date on the confiscated material, but the investigation is only under way.
We cannot yet know what can be revealed there, one of Yle's interviewers says.
A week ago, extensive searches on Turku islands and mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation involves merely economic crime or a threat to the internal security of Finland.
This week, the afternoon gathered a case in which arguments are being discussed both for and against.
Video: The Dream Mall saved Liverpool's Loss Series
The 100 percent start of Liverpool Valioligue was completed, but it was still more satisfied with team 1-1 balance game in Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be just a year after Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and escaped to a 1-0 guest win.
Then the combination of Pep Guardiola sent the whole Valioligue a signal that City was serious now.
Everyone remembers how the last season ended.
And I'm sure that Liverpool manager Jûrgen Klopp arrived with the same idea in Western London.
The Reds had begun with six successive wins.
Liverpool started stronger and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to rule alone after his own field end.
Chelsea, in turn, had a great Wednesday league guest win from Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard rose from the exchange bench to solve the fight with a wonderful individual approach.
Now, of course, Hazard was involved from the beginning of the minute.
In the 25th minute he first balled in a small state with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Eventually, the Croat saw Hazard crashing forward and sent him a fully weighted output.
Hazard went a little along the line of punishment, but he bombed the perfect left foot of the bet in the back corner.
Pool's brass guard Alisson was a little slow in his fight and didn't just get his finger in the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss position lightly unfair because almost immediately after Antonio Rüdiger took over Mo Salah's command from the goal line.
In the second section, Chelsea Water Kepa also got into real action.
The Basque guard reacted quickly to Sadio Mané's appeal and pushed the ball from the top to the corner.
On the other hand, Alisson's zero throwing through Hazard.
The best place for the guests came in 72 minutes when James Milner found Bobby Firmino.
However, the brass star's buckle headed toward the country teammate David Luiz, who saved the leadership of the hosts.
It didn't last for 89 minutes, either, when an exchanger, Daniel Sturridge, was free to shoot from 25 meters.
Sturridge played in his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed it in honor of an unbelievable bet in the top corner.
The 100 percent league start of Liverpool was completed with 1-1 match, but it's still in the league range, together with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also closely involved in the championship of two points behind the head.
In a time transfer conversation, the poteros are deep.
I remember when a decade ago a magazine asked different Finnish influencers which share the people of Finland.
Juice Leskiese's answer was the only one left in mind: the Nen end.
Some have a nose end and some have no last name.
You know, there's a number of lines that can be born anywhere, and here's one of the bidders.
Finland in the EU has resulted in the abandonment of the annual time transfer.
Very many agree that the transfer of clocks twice a year has been the job of fools and caused many kinds of problems.
Finally, this achievement seems to be at least the easiest stage of the solution in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The hardest thing now is to decide which time will eventually end: the current summer or winter or some other time zone.
This also allows the people to say their opinions on the takekantaa.fi page.
The survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open for Friday 12 October.
The debate is being held in the coffee tables and in the social media, and everyone has his words to say.
Those who defend winter time justify their position with the influence of the morning on human well-being and the summer time, with the influence of the light on the appearance of humans and thus on the well-being.
Both positions have strong supporters and good arguments.
According to the studies, the morning morning will speed up man's day and give you refreshment.
On the other hand, if you are not particularly suffering from awakening in the dark, you will increase the light of people's movement outside and give better opportunities for, for example, autumn yards.
The additional amount of light has already been calculated after the normal working day.
I'd like to take both of us, but we can't do anything about our bad position in the northeast of the earth.
Winters are too dark and summers for many too bright anyway.
It is typical of the debate on the subject that our own view is driven and the view of the other is strongly opposed.
The opposite's arguments are not very much heard, because the most important thing is how it feels about itself.
As almost everyone finds an opinion about this, it's kind of useless to try to turn another's head.
There's a lot of rut to waste.
The issue is a terrible easy argument, because it does not require a great deal of attention and there is a sufficient sense of mutilation as a justification.
In general, similar issues are disputed more firmly and equally fruitlessly.
Well, it's a shame if the wrong option comes to be chosen, but I don't think it'll fit in.
And it always offers an appropriate sinful saint if life feels bad.
Josba fought for a full-blown guest win.
Josba's first guest game in Divar's salibandy produced Nurmon Jymy with three full serial points.
Josba left the Wall River home for a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory with him.
Nurmo still led the goal at the beginning of the third round, but Josba applied for compositions and recycled men in chains.
In time, 50.47 brothers Eedu and Juso Lehtiniemi plotted a 6-5 win goal.
Both teams played decisive minutes at a level.
Josba's most effective was Juso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain was firepowered anyway when Teemu Ashen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) were also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also played his goal at the time of birth in the second chain.
After three rounds, Josba has six points.
The next meeting will be with O2-Jyväskyla in two weeks' time.
Eno's church on Sunday 200th anniversary
The 200th anniversary of the Eno Church will be celebrated tomorrow Sunday in a very sad atmosphere.
A week ago, the destruction of the church's risk of excitement was a shock.
Even the church was guarded two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain today, there's still a party place.
Even if no one would like to do so, it is now the oldest church of the Joensuu Congregation.
The church in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Eno despite all the municipal and other associations of the world.
The family fair starts at Eno Church today at 10:00.
Then we move to the parish to the cattle's table.
There's all kinds of things inside and outside of the program all day long.
For example, the church building can be acquainted with the retired, Ari Räsäsen, a 37 - year - old congregation master.
The Church's birthday celebration also means the end of one era.
Already out of use, the churchhouse built in 1982 will keep its doors open for the last time today.
Now we're in an emergency room in the former municipal building, says Cap. Markku Koistinen.
The church house destroyed the inner air problems, but the church has been standing in a healthy position for 200 years.
Elon Musk departs from Tesla's head of the government's office... the charges of fraud were settled for $40 million.
The electronic car manufacturer Tesla and CEO of the company Elon Musk have agreed on their case with the US Securities Market Authority SEC.
The SEC suspected that Musk had committed fraud and was at risk of being left behind by the company it had established.
However, Musk may continue to be the CEO of Tesla.
On the other hand, Musk will have to depart from the seat of the President of the Tesla Government for three years.
The company will have to hire the president of an external government.
Musk is also under stricter supervision.
According to the agreement, Tesla must hire two independent leaders and then monitor more closely Musk communication.
In addition, Tesla and Musk pay both $20 million (approximately €17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent new market disturbances and adverse effects on Tesla shareholders," says Director Steven Peik's SEC.
The case started in August when Musk wrote on Twitter that he might pull the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing is secured.
The TV raised Tesla's share rate for a moment.
SEC suspected that Musk was guilty of fraud.
According to the Agency, the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not talked about the arrangement with the other company's management or potential funders.
In practice, the agency accused Muskia of misleading investors.
On Friday, the SEC announced that it would challenge the company and the Musk.
The SEC stated that it would require Musk to be sentenced to fines and be prohibited from acting under the supervision of the stock exchange companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's share went to a strong fall.
Over 800 people killed in the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami
In the case of the Indonesian earthquake and the subsequent tsunami, the number of deaths has risen to at least 832, according to the AFP news agency.
It is believed that the number of deaths is still increasing, because the settlement of the disasters is still ongoing.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure may rise to thousands.
The earthquake on Friday raised the tsunami that attacked the city of Palu on the island of Sulawes.
Tsunam was immediately given after the earthquake, but a warning was quickly withdrawn.
According to the authorities, almost all the known dead are from Palm for the time being.
The rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the centre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
As of now, many people are known to be dead.
Restructuring requests for assistance
The Indonesian army has been alarmed to help rescue workers find victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the area of destruction today, urged soldiers to continue their rescues without exhausting days and nights.
One of the centers of salvation is the Palu hotel, which is still believed to be 50-60 people in ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, Chief of the Rescue Agency, told me that one person alive in the night of the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, favoured by business travellers.
We also heard people's requests for help, he told me.
According to Syaug, the earthquake and the tsunami area would be quickly deployed with heavy cleaning equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in Palu and nearby.
My friend's family members are still missing, and one writer appealed to the Facebook team.
Politicians' phone numbers leaked into disturbing hands in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contacts leaked because of shortcomings in the encryption of the application.
The disturbers were able to access, among other things, the telephone numbers of ministers.
This was an application used at the British Conservative Party meeting in the government.
For example, Mr Michael Gove, Minister for the Environment, Food and Rural Development, and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, were subjected to harassment.
Several parliamentarians received harassment calls.
Because of the lack of encryption of the application, the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were at the Conservative Party's Annual Meeting in the mobile application.
The audience reached out to the profiles using the political e-mail address that was easily available online.
The person who entered the profile was able to look and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to turn Boris Johnson's profile into a porn picture for a moment, and I tipped it off.
Michael Goven's profile picture was exchanged by media moguli Rupert Murdoch's image.
The Guardian's columnist Dawn Foster described the problem by writing that the meeting application allows the entry to other people's profiles at these email addresses.
Then the logger can look at the profile person's contact details and, for example, send messages in this name.
The meeting app made every journalist, politician and participant's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Conservative party informant apologized for the leak.
He said that technical problems have been solved and the application is now working safely.
The British Information Authority ICO supports data leakage.
The application was developed by the Australian Crown Comms company.
The opposition's Labour Party criticizes the fact that the Conservative Party cannot be trusted in security matters.
Every week, there is a large number of Polish people in The Wall in Finland.
Watched viewers drew attention to the reactions of the studio audience in The Wall Finland.
The U.S. Format The Wall, which spread rapidly around the world, ran in the Finnish version of Neloselle last Saturday.
Heikki Paasosi's hosted game show is described in Poland in the same studio where the form of other international productions are made.
In the Polish studio, the descriptions were exceptional, as the large 12 meters high wall of the form required space from the farm.
During the initial period, the social media raised the programme's studio audience, which was presumed to be Polish.
On Twitter, there would be a debate on whether the studio might be able to see the Polish sitting in the Finnish game.
Unne Sormunen, head of the four-country programmes, will illuminate this for the evening magazine.
He tells us that there are players close to the studio, other Finns, foreign Finns living in Poland, as well as Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international fighters in Finland's production, just like the audiences of the The Wall periods described in other countries' same production mode.
In Finland, too, there are such groups, so-called trade unions, which go to the descriptions of different programmes, Sormune's tasting.
He recalls that following the game in itself is not so difficult even if it does not understand the language in which it is played.
Red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to distinguish.
There are, however, interpreters in the study of foreign languages who carry out translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as a simultaneous closure to the studio director.
And then the studio director instructs the audience and tells us what kind of hop there is throwing, for example, and what the situation is going on, Sormune says.
He compares the situation with David Hasselhoff in domestic production recently.
David Hasselhoff was involved a few years ago in Talent Finland's descriptions with us in Finland.
All the time he had a simultaneous eruption in his ear, and he knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the descriptions, the sum of the Sormune.
Japan's southern parts of the taifum are moving towards the main islands - the authorities warn of land belts and floods
The authorities will also warn of possible land vaults and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Taifuuni Tram, but the authorities say that large injuries have been avoided and there is no information on deaths so far.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so hard that it has turned the cars around.
According to the NHK Broadcasting Company, people have been evacuated into shelters and electricity has been cut off from more than 300 000 households.
More than a thousand flights have been cancelled, and the bullet trains are stationary for the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka for half a day in Finland.
The capital of Tokyo is not directly on the path of the storm, but there are also strong winds and rains.
The train shifts have been cancelled in Tokyo today.
According to legal scientists, Trami's been stabbing Japan until Monday.
The sky of the wombs blurred further
It's been a bad start.
The sky was already darkened almost as soon as the team lost on Saturday at its home field for Vaasan Sport by reading 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The poraries now have five consecutive losses, and scores from the six rounds are in a total of two.
None of the defenders of the moss or two lower chain players have yet to paint.
The pressure also grows all the time.
Sports against the audience was already banished at the time when the game was almost half left.
Six games are only played and, of course, there is no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to worry about it, because that's a bit weak of what we played.
Especially the performance of the second lottery was embarrassingly bad, the power of Jarno Kärki 1+2 told Us.
Of course, it tasted like a victory for sports.
The team had a game underneath Friday night, so I thought it would have been visible in doing it.
Maybe it did, but the Asses couldn't take advantage of it.
The number of visitors to the day of the bread continued to grow
The mother of the day of the bread, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders at the audience in the big hall of the event.
Somehow, I thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, Mr. Moorine will think about it in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the SM competitions of the Traktoriknön were held at the same time as the Day of Leipzig, so perhaps in the expectation that the audience could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, it did not happen; the corridors were already rippled before the ten, the vendors reported that the products were out, the newswood was sold more than nearly 500 doses before, and even in the number of cars, Maarinen heard that there was an increase.
An estimate of the number of visitors has been about 6,000, says Hyvärinen later this afternoon.
For five hours in the morning and afternoon, there was a special programme for children's families, which seems to attract them to a lot of record.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will go further.
The salesmen also tend to take Liperi every year from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred of the rapporteurs, handicrafts, bakers and harvesters had arrived in their breadmaker.
The mother of the day of the feast, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the audience at the hall view.
At the beginning of the day of the feast, the crop was blessed.
In the children's series, Teija Kivinieme's beautiful bread won a public ballot.
There were 11 different forms of bread in the children's bread competition.
Marjatta Vepsäläinen, the winner of the rose sandwich contest, spent the day at the martian pie shop.
7 x most beautiful lamps - this is where you recognize a good lamp
Awake the space to life, create the right mood for the decoration and read the book without tiring.
A good illumination is worth a hundred.
We gathered together three good reasons to invest in illumination.
The tips were given by Innolux's sales and marketing director Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favor to your eyes
The importance of enlightenment increases, the more years of age are behind.
Sufficient light can help with problems that many people face with age when the accuracy of their vision is diminished and more and more are suffering.
Parentally, the need for light also increases.
Sixty-year-olds need light three times more than twenty-year-olds.
Therefore, the effects of the light and the characteristics of the lamp should already be observed for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light, but it doesn't suffocate, Jokiniemi tips.
Create beauty around you
The beautiful decoration can only be displayed with proper lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment can afford to choose.
It has a japanese style that combines unhealthy, scandinavian and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retrostyle, inspired by the 1970s, with strong colors, with different metal tones or ice cream colours, has risen to bum.
Reality is fascinating in the same way as in the rest of the house.
The materials are now displayed in wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather and bamboo.
Reveal Your Personality
On the other hand, more is now being invested in the home than before, and the decoration has become a way of expressing itself.
Instead of mass production, they want a tailored, bold lamp with a story to tell.
People clearly apply for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So let's be very design-conscious, says Jokiniemi.
The home is not necessarily acquired as a new trendy light, but as a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewelry and elegant classics keep their surfaces from year to year, says Jokiniemi.
Thank you and good-bye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian attacker after three games.
The roads to Kooko and the attacker Brendan O'Donnell are out of line.
A Canadian attacker played three League matches in the Orange Museum without power points, KooKoo tells us.
In August, O'Donnell moved to KooKoo by a one-year agreement, which included a durable trial period at the end of September.
Last year, a 26-year-old attacker played at KHL in Kunlund Red Star rows and at KHL farm in VHL, KRS Heilongjiang.
There's no information yet on O'Donnellin's new company.
The gameman wants to show an example in recycling... the goods go to the world in recycling boxes, the plastic switched to paper.
Games Special Movement Game is currently recycling games as well as packaging materials.
The products of the stone-foot store are no longer packed in plastic bags, but in paper bags made from recycling materials.
For example, products ordered from online trade are packed into packaging from importers.
All the packages coming for us will be reused.
We may use boxes ten times as long as the package is in the condition that it can be used, says Ville Puurula Oulu's Gameman.
As soft material, the company normally uses newspapers and other similar recycling materials.
The bubbles are avoided as far as possible.
In the near future, we are going to move in the envelope to recycling material.
The movement wants to show an example to others too.
Recycling isn't going to cause any extra trouble, according to Puurula.
There's no big problem starting to recycle.
It also comes with economic savings when, for example, carton packaging is being reused.
Recycling suits Gameman's activities in a natural way, as, in addition to new products, the main product range of the movement includes, among other things, used games and equipment.
Procurement of each fashion-conscious: One and the same shirt works in each suit
Classical clothing works from time to time in suits like dresses.
They create the foundation of a good garderob with its multi-use, as it is easy to gather different costumes in the surroundings of high-quality classics.
In autumn, the classics most used in the wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category also includes black poolo.
A black needle made from natural material with poolokauls cannot be mistaken.
The garment can be connected to both straight pants, dull skirts and jeans, and around it can create both a controlled housing and a stylish style.
Pooloneule is suitable for both a young modern dress and a classic style artist.
I saw you create a style.
The trendy tale of autumn comes from golden browns and wide-spread spy jeans, black pooloneule and grey ankles.
The classic pooloneule together with other classics, the blueish scotch ham and the red wine loafers, constitute a feminine and refined house.
Brings it to a black pooloneule by combining it with trendy garments: jean skirt, high boots and thick stockings.
Young and stylish!
The sabotage of Russian intelligence services has a long tradition
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation's foreign Representation SVR or the military Representation GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet Union, the so-called DRG groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from Russian-language words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: the sabotage and intelligence group.
The agents of the Soviet Security Service in the western KGB are preparing detailed plans on important sabotage targets, reports KGB's broken archiver Vasili Mitroh (1922-2004).
His information was published in Christopher Andrew's books at the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 2000s
Targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, KGB acquired DRG groups for Bundeswehr, Railways, Riders and Certain Dealers' uniforms and apartments for cover operations.
This trich was used by Russian parachute soldiers in Krim in February 2014: they dressed in local Ukrainian police riot equipment, established inspection stations for you leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated from their motherland in Krim.
Cold-war agents hid to the sabotase groups on the ground packaging with mines, explosives, lighters and messages.
In 1998, KGB's arm was still found in Switzerland, which was exploded when the authorities injected it with water tanks.

HPK keeps the risk in line with the end of the period, Lehtisen's test time is over
HPK Sports Director Mika Toivola says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in initiatives, under-powering and a four-field defense role.
At the beginning of the autumn, Filip Riska played will continue at Hämeenlinna HPK in the end of the season.
The success of an experienced risk, 33, in the roles offered to him, assured the company.
Filip has been an important part for us in initiatives, underpower play and the four-field defense role.
Even if there is still something to be improved, it is good for the young team to hold on to such an experienced player, HPK's sports director Mika Toivola commented on the company's news.
Hopefully, the risk value will rise when playing hockey league solutions games.
The Central Attacker Risk from St. Petersburg has previously played a league in JYP, Locker and Sport.
The next attacker, Oskari Lehtinen, was left without a contract after the trial.
A reality on TV today: The climber was left to die twice
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on man's own experiences.
The movie of the evening was made on the basis of it.
Everest now gets his first night on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snow storm surprised climbers at Mount Everest.
Baltasar Kormákuri's 2015 leadership relates to the survival struggle that has been dealt with in cereals.
Tragedy has been made of movies and documentaries before.
Real events are also being discussed in this case.
The highest mountain in the world took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced leaders of the expeditions: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
That's exactly what Hall was doing as a guide to Weathers.
The life of Weathers could have been saved before the eye surgery was carried out in Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure on the air, he lost his vision, which was why the conquest of the summit had to be ignored.
Rob Hall continued his journey and never returned.
However, the struggle of Weathers for life and death had only begun.
As the storm rose, he was lost and no longer found back in the camp.
When they came to find him, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe in survival.
Weathers was left to die.
However, as a miracle trade, he still got on his feet and found others.
The badly cold Weathers were thought to be still dying and once again he was left on his own fortune.
It's clear that, contrary to other expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point the riders began to believe in the possibility of being helped.
In a movie, Beck Weathers is playing Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today we celebrated the 200-year-old Church of Eno.
A 200-year-old church has been celebrated in the church today.
The church was inaugurated on October 4, 1818, and the whole family celebration was prepared for the celebration of the year for Sunday.
The feast began at 10:00 Eno Church at the family fair, after which there has been an antimatter of the cattle table at Eno Church House.
The church was full.
There were 517 participants in the family fair.
Eno Church Lord Armi Rail Mountain was glad that people had come to the church so much.
It is a great joy yet for a long time and give power to work, says Rail Mountain (in the picture).
The fire of the excitement danger church has touched many, and it was not overlooked at the 200th anniversary of the Eno congregation.
The Church of Eno is now the elder of the Evangelical Lutheran congregations of Joensuu after the destruction of the church's danger of extinction.
The wooden church was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a dent was held, where the church was silenced and remembered in a fire.
Photos and videos: The Medican showed his power in Greece - the sea disappeared and the street became a river
A powerful hurricane-like storm blew up on Saturday from lunch to Greece.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, is named Zorba.
The Greek Institute of Air Science has issued a red weather warning to the regions of Attika, Peloponnesos, Joonian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The pictures taken from the region show a lot of floods around Greece.
The video on Twitter shows how, between houses in the city of Kiato, in the Corinthian region, the river has suddenly appeared instead of the street due to floods.
The second video shows how the car has been transported by floodwater.
In the southern part of the peninsula of Peloponnese, the heavy wind caused a powerful sea trip.
The Finnish Embassy of Athens instructs people on its Facebook site to reserve for a storm in Greece.
The mission invites the monitoring of weather information and guidance from local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or a medic, brings with it hardships and even the danger of flooding.
According to CNN, one 2011 study shows that medics occur only once or two years in the world, typically on the roads of September-October, when the sea temperature is still high.
The storm now blowing left behind floods in Tunisia and Libya before continuing its journey to the north and Europe.
In Greece, there have also been refugee camps in the islands, such as Lesboks.
Thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in camps have limited access to adequate protection.
Under the storm are also the areas destroyed by land fires in the environment of Athens in the summer.
In Greece, the Mediterranean was also raging last November.
We don't have to go to the sea now, but the flights are still on schedule. Thousands of Finns on the Greek islands threatened by a storm.
Even when you walk, you should be careful that you don't fly rays or other loose goods in the storm.
Such instructions have been shared by guides in just 3,500 Greeks to a Finnish weekend for holidays through sunrise.
The instructions come into need, because even the Zorbas storm that rises to the atrocities has been predicted to spicy Greek islands this weekend.
For example, in the vicinity of the island of Kreeta, the wind speed can rise in the woods to up to 45 meters in seconds.
The weather's aggravated by heavy rains.
All travellers who have reported their telephone numbers from Greece through Sun travel and Tui have been warned of hard winds by text message.
Still in the air sun and heat
According to Inka Ikosen, a communication expert on sunshine trips early Saturday nights, the worst has been avoided at holiday destinations.
For example, flights have landed and risen according to normal schedule.
Of course, we follow the situation all the time.
Security ahead of us.
Antony Schroderus, a supporter of the media, tells me that their flights have also been on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our target personnel.
At least Crete was still calm, he told me Saturday night.
The most popular Greek islands, i.e. Rodox and Crete, currently have a total of 1,500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers leave in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm in Kos Island will arrive on Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rodox had ridiculed the sun and the temperature was in pain at 27 degrees, says Icone of the Sun travels.
It is estimated that Zorbasis will become the next problem in Turkey, although slightly mild.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and we have, for example, checked the number of Finns flying to Antalya Tulla, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Huss are completely identical evening suits in the Missifinal, so they react to the situation.
The Media Person and Fitness Beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open evening dress.
Hussi says he got a dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust professionals who found me a really great suit for tonight, Hussi smiles.
Exactly the same silver suit had also chosen the designer Shirly Karvine.
Two people also noticed their similar outfits and took a laugh at the situation.
Karvinen told him he was busy preparing for the Night-Sannis, and he had to get on the plane.
Hussi works in Missifinal as a backstage and red carpet editor, and he talks to the stars of the front row.
Huss has a fresh move behind him because he moved from Kamp on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what's going on.
It's important that the new apartment has its own office, Hussi wondered.
Before I moved, Hussi took a vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in the hotel for a week without going anywhere.
When stress erupted, I got a flu, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, says Hussi.
Shirly Karvise's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention to collecting curious watches from retirees.
The runner and Miss Shirly Karvinen in 2016 told Miss Finland's final red carpet that she had enough to do with radio broadcasts and Love Island Finnish films.
Even to the extent that Karvinen arrived in the final line directly from Finnair's flight, it has been enough.
I made and put the hair on the plane.
This is that glamour.
You know, at home for the evening dress exchange, Karvinen laughs.
Hair tells me he pulled out his makeup in the middle of the pensioners.
His preparation also raised the attention of travellers.
I had a big mirror, and I saw people's eyes in the mirror.
My makeup was at least fun for the rest of us.
The hair will fly to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends about a few days at a time.
Karvinen says he enjoyed his pestilence as a Finnish planner.
He describes his experience as being also stopable so far.
Hair tells me he came by to say hi to the singles on Friday.
It's kind of raw.
These are people's real feelings, Karvinen describes the feelings of the singles of the program.
How do I wear your over-generation boots?
Three perfect examples
Classical garments are garments that work from time to time in suits like dresses.
Often classics are decades old, but sometimes there are more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the super-polar boots that came up in the winter and in September have not gone anywhere.
According to their names, the boots above the knee are repeated in style from year to year.
Looking boots share users' opinions, but a bold model is worth trying, well... bravely.
In fact, superpolar boots are actually suitable for any kind of housing.
It's about jeans, pizzas, sloppy or tricose, the simple leather or artificial leather surface of the boots works.
Long boots look good in the festivities as well as in archiasues.
Black tops of the knees fit well in the manikins of the house.
They appropriately balance the femininity of the pink, flowery plyzer ham and peppery, thick needle.
A fresh but autumn-style archiasu for romantic taste.
The strong and slightly retro-spiritive housing is derived from long copper-brown luxuries, super-polar boots, earrings and lace bags.
Although there is a certain subtleness in the tops of the knees, they are also perfectly suitable for relaxing arc along with a T-shirt, long shorts and a trendy ticket.
Lovely easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars start operating in Espoo.
They're running for the rest of the year and taking passengers, the city of Espoo informs.
Takenieme robot cars are operating in the role of the bus simulator, as the next spring area is intended to be launched by a robot bus.
The project will develop and pilot robotic traffic throughout the year and test the technical performance of vehicles under Finnish conditions.
The experiment will find out how robot cars are doing on the current street network.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus drivers the opportunity to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, traffic manager.
For the first time, robot cars travel fully automatically between other traffic without special transport arrangements.
The safety of the vehicles is always the responsibility of the passenger who sits on board.
Vehicles constantly sense their environment with several different sensors and assess whether the driveway is free.
If it is not, they will interpret whether a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowboard, has been detected, says Harri Santamala, Managing Director of Sensible 4 for the development of robotic traffic.
Robot cars travel all autumn three days a week: Tuesdays at 13:15.30, Wednesdays at 10:15 and Thursdays at 10:15.
Robot cars stop on six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
Robot car stops identify the stop markings.
I'm sure you'll be able to drive from the stop on Otakaare number one.
Mokoma Foundation fell on the stage in the middle of the show and got hurt.
The Mokoma Group will report on the surprising situation in Tampere at the Package Room.
The Mokoma group's show in Tampere Packing Room was dramatically turned on Saturday, when the band based Santtu Humäläinen fell on the stage in the middle of the show.
It happened when the band was pulling the last song tonight.
The spider's wrist's broken.
The band will report it on its Facebook page.
"We're alive!"
Santu stumbled in the Packaging Room last night on the stage in the last song and broke her wrist.
Let's hope for quick healing for a metal brother!
The rest of the tour runs with a backup, the pages read.
The Mokoma fans are worried about the photo update, where the baset-Santu is lying on the kip in his hand in the bed.
This news has been expected, it was pretty hard to worry about how bad it was.
The relief is great, the bones will be improved fortunately with time.
Make it easier and quick to recover to Santu and continue a good tour for the other band plus the tutor!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great show, but will you promise to continue to leave such a strong play off the end of drama? write a fan.
Police monitored hunting in North Karelia and Savo
On Friday and Saturday, with the Forestry Government and the Finnish Rice Centre in North Karelia and Ylä-Savo, police personnel reported on Saturday in the social media.
The main weight of supervision was in the lawfulness and authorization of hunting.
Every hunter was checked for a hunting licence and a hunting licence required by the State.
In addition, the licences for the possession of hunting weapons and the authorized numbers of self-deploying weapons used for chicken laying were checked.
According to the police, 112 hunters were inspected during the check, and only one hunter was in contact with the control, who did not have the necessary hunting permit.
The hunter was assigned an unreasonable 12-day fine.
In addition, the police blew up 133 drivers of the vehicle, and two of them are suspected of driving drunkenness.
In addition, the patrols dealt with five traffic violations in a fine procedure, a police one.
As a summary, hunters comply very well with the permit of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by supervision.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time someone checked the permits."
The Eastern Finland Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in autumn, together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen goes to Turkey to follow the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (Code) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to follow the selection of contingent refugees to Finland.
Finland has been decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Selections are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration Agency, the Ministry of Labour and Industry and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN Refugee Organization UNHCR will first elect people in a particularly vulnerable position.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly urgent situation in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, disabled and ill, women and children.
More people are selected for the coming group in Finland than there is in the quota, because practically some of them do not arrive for different reasons.
It is also a mute meeting of NGOs operating on the border between Süleyman Soylu and Syria, Turkish Minister of the Interior.
Ilkka Salmi, Head of the Ministry of Interior, is also involved.
Speaking of quota lifting
Finland has already taken contingent refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1050 years, but there has been no agreement in the government to raise it.
The meeting has supported the increase in the quota, but the project has lately fallen into the blue resistance.
Mr Juha Sipilä (center) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota to 1 500-2 000 people per year.
During this period of government, a mute visit is the first to be carried out by the Minister of Interior to monitor the choice of quotas.
Previous interior ministers Petter Orpo (coc.) and Paula Risikko (coc.) were able to move to their new tasks before the visits were held.
Finland receives support from the EU of EUR 10 000 for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now let's go to the beckons... no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
Last Saturday, the Karjani newsed a bill to change the animal protection law.
In the article, it was understood that the proposal for a law initially prohibits the holding of all animals which are not permitted separately by the regulations of the ministries as production animals, pets or other business activities.
In other words, everything else is basically prohibited except for the animals specifically mentioned in the Regulation.
If the bill comes to an end, it means that we are rejecting the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger society's security or a good way.
We are now in the process of setting out, in principle, the prohibition of all activities to which the law or regulation does not authorise.
The change leads to the fact that nothing new can be tested, for example, in business activities or do anything else until the law or regulation is adopted.
The government's functioning in the preparation of law has generally been weak.
If we are now going to the way that, starting with Finland, everything is banned, which is not allowed separately, we no longer know whether to cry or laugh.
I don't doubt that the Animal Protection Act would require an update.
But the law project in this direction is not part of democracy.
Unfortunately, I do not know the Constitution very well, but I wonder if it will accept such a "everything is prohibited, which is not permitted in the law or regulation alone".
I hope there's a reasonable minister who's gonna interrupt the progress of such a law project.

Turkey calls for mobile phones to be downloaded in case of a storm
The Zorba storm blown in Greece on Saturday is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned the seamen, fishermen and farmers of the Greek storm in particular of the West Coast, writing CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is reported to be moving along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
The catastrophic and emergency authorities called on citizens early Saturday night to download their mobile phones before the storm and to ensure that internet connection works so that people can get up-to-date updates, reports the local news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
People have been encouraged to stay at home and away from the windows and, for example, to move garden furniture out of the wind.
Turkey is expected to be severe and the wind is expected to blow between 28 and 33 meters in seconds.
In Greece, a red weather warning
On Saturday, the Greek Air Science Service issued a red weather warning to the regions of South Greece, Attika, Peloponnesos, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Greek travel agencies warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy also issued a storm warning.
Travellers were invited to follow weather information and guidance from local authorities.
A little while ago when I contacted, there was a great wind and rain.
People were very peaceful. Communications Chief Laura Aaltonen, from Tui's travel agency, told STT Saturday.
Awakening described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By evening, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had also not received any messages from the Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports did not operate on Saturday, told local news agency Amna.
The boats to the sea were cancelled on Saturday, told STT about travel agencies.

Kimi Räikkönen litigated the reason for Mercedes's superiority to Ferrari
Ferrari Kimi Räikkönen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too hard at the time of the Russian gp.
However, there is no reason to fail in the Ferrari camp, an experienced driver's assessment.
They were just faster than us, but there's nothing huge about it.
Our car was the best in time all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, fourthly driven, and with his partner Sebastian Vetteli, Räikkönen, who clearly left the Mercedes speed, said.
Ferrari was having a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
A question was asked about the sudden fall of Mercedes' ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are, so simple it is.
If I knew why, we'd probably go as fast as they did.
But I don't know more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In time, there was a rare delight in the Sauber of Räikkösen's coming stall.
For the next season, Charles Leclerc, who was replaced by Ferrari, was the seventh, and Marcus Ericsson was also able to attend the last time event.
For the Swedish driver, the tenth place of departure is the best for more than three years.
And although in the second driving session five drivers left completely out of driving, the result was still tasty for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging thinking about Räikkos?
Yes, if you compare to where they were from the early age, then the step forward has been big.
Next year there's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
Robert Helenius knocked Erkan Teper out, "Robbe is back."
Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper's match at the night of Stuttgart took place on a steady footing.
The German was the most initiativeful party in the ring, but he did not get the right hit.
Evidently more extensive Helenius controls the fight with his hard series that they found very well.
The Finnish was also clearly in a better physical condition than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth round when Helenius knocked on the left straight to Teperin.
The hit was so hard that the guy who fought before the home audience didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was assured Helenius was very mildly fanned.
At first, in an interview, he praised the good mood and opposition created by the public.
Then he changed Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all viewers and Finnish encouragers.
We took the belt with us today.
Helenius was happy right after the match.
It was a really big victory for Helenius' career.
Perhaps it would be a chance to even get to the MM game, Helenius commented on the afternoon before the match.
Instead, the loss might have ended the entire boxing career.
Of course it's been in mind.
This isn't gonna get any younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before he hit Teper.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster may multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president calls for a clear increase in the number of victims.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the total number of victims can rise to thousands.
Severe conditions
The rescuers are looking for trapped and also for the dead in the worst suffering areas of Sulawes Island: the port city of Palu and its neighbour Donggala.
So far, all victims are from Palus, and the situation in Donggala is not clear yet.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 have been badly injured.
There are still people in the broken buildings that the rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, a hotel called Roa Roa in Palu has collapsed.
The Saviors say they heard the screams of people trapped from ruins, but the lack of cleansing equipment has delayed the beginning of salvation.
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, has assigned an army for rescue and extermination.
There is a need for the military and its equipment, as electricity and communication connections in the disaster zone are crossed in many locations.
Fuel reserves are also running out.
Miss Finland's hesitant answer and long thought caused laughter
Billnis Ruuk is currently selecting a new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, each Missifinalist was asked a question.
The finalists asked the question about the glass bowl on the stage.
Especially the finalist of the six Emilia Anttikosken, 23, hesitant response was the result of sweet but kind laughter in the audience.
The question put to Anttikos was made through Facebook.
The user Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the latest book the Missiphinalist has ever read.
Anttikoski thought about his answer with a good deal before he started his doubts.
Thank you for asking me, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read has... Anttikoski said thinking.
The question was raised in the public at a time of laughter until Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
Probably something related to economics.
So the last book I've read is someone in economics, Anttikoski answered.
After his answer, Anttikoski received the applause from the audience, echoed by laughter.
Anttikoski, a former Missikirtue, drew attention because he did not want to possess underwear because of his principles.
The 2018 Miss Finland will be crowned at 9:00 a.m. when the last year Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will give up the crown.
The apple pepper cake of yours takes away the language
This recipe is for you with good, acidic apples from your own back, because the domestic apple is in the shop at a shocking price.
You might have to buy a pear, even though I think a lot of people already grow that pearl tree.
This cake can also only be made of apples if the pearl does not want to be bought.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the cake also saddles its pearl.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed codes.
Slow down.
Melt can in a pot.
Stick eggs and sugar into foam and then add the corn flour to the foam and the melting can.
Combine maize starch, maize and bake powder, and add them to the sausage.
Add manure meals and wheat meal, mix well.
Mount the bread bed with bakery paper, sprinkle 2 candy sugar to the bottom of the year and spread peppers over the sugar.
It sprinkled half of the sausage on the peppers and the apples on the sausage.
The end sprinkled on the apple shells.
Cook in the oven in 180 degrees about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let's cool down in the bed and then revoke the waitress.
Just cut the cake cool.
The cake is fragile in its structure and is easily broken because there are almond and corn flour with no gluten.
An international criminal literature event will be held in January
The International Literature Festival for Nordic Crime Literature will be held in Kuusamo Ruka for the first time in January.
The Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other book numbers and jazz music.
Among other things, the Swedish twin Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who are visiting the festival's literature, are the stars of Swedish dekkari literature, Jens Lapidus and Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to the Swedish names, there are also visiting writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers in the event represent Max Seeck.
According to festival organizers, the northern location, nature, the dark season and the unique environment of Kuusamo provide a framework for the dream experience in writing.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts of popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who analysed this matter, have outlined two species of "coolidity" of a slightly different nature: generally attractive coolness and, to that extent, opposite dissenting coolidity.
Depending on the description of the researchers, attractively cool people had many socially desired features: they were outward-looking, friendly, compatible and qualified.
On the other hand, there was typical distance, independence, rebellion and fracture for other thinkers.
They thirsted for experience and cared only a little about external assessments.
Both types combined good self-esteem and stable emotional life.
The role of the harder is not cool: high status in teenage age will not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is what the U.S. study published in the Child Development magazine 2014 shows.
Young people dating early, partying, looking for good - looking teams and seeking popularity were at increased risk of using defeats as young adults and leading to crimes.
In their human relationships, they were more successful than their most unspeakable agemates.
High-status suk cars, label bags or watches don't make you cool or at least really attractive.
In a study published in the Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more prepared to become friends with their ordinary market shirts than with their branded shirts - despite the fact that most of them chose a branded shirt in the context of acquaintance.
If you're on Greece's holidays, be careful!
There's a horrific storm in there. The weather warning's screaming red.
During the weekend in southern Greece, water can rain as much as in Finland on average over six months.
The Zorbas storm will strike Greece during the weekend.
If you stay in the area of Peloponnese, Ionian islands, Cyclades or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy of Athens will report it on its Facebook page.
According to the Embassy, the Greek Air Science Service has given the regions a red warning of weather.
The near storm is also reported on the weather service in Foreca's blog.
According to it, the hardest woods in the storm are up to 45 meters per second.
For the sake of comparison, the Kuisma storm blew its hardest by 31 meters in a second.
According to the blog, however, the greatest concern of the Zorbas storm is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
At the end of the week, more than 300 millimeters of water can be found in South Greece.
It corresponds to about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Weather Service Severe Weather Europa has shared the video of the development of the storm on its Facebook page.
The Zorbas storm has caused floods earlier this week in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognize a man's death of Love Island in Finland?
It's played by confusing Youtube videos.
Few people know that in the Love Island Finnish series, several men's beautiful Anku also show up in strange videos of Youtube in 2010 as an asphalt theater.
With videos, Anku advises askers, among other things, to make a mustard from an old economic paperboard.
The duck also shows its sympathetic style how the stockings can be slapped into a coil to which the right spikes grow.
Now we make the pastures grow, but do it a little surprisingly, the duke inspires and presents sawing, socks and seeds of ravine from which he makes a sieve.
Videos can be viewed below or on the Youtube Canal of the Duck here.
Valtter Bottas was shaking and squeezing adrenaline in Sotsh. Will he be the helper of Hamilton on Sunday?
Power Bottas would shake a little more than ten minutes after his Russian gp toast while he was in front of the media.
A fine tour left Mercedes's number one in Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a mentally important criticism for the Finnish man who gathered this season.
Nice tour.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left in the middle of the round.
It feels good, I'm still a little shaken, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been on the stake once this year, in Austria (medium summer), so time has passed quite a bit.
This track has been good to me before, and I got some good rounds again.
It's not easy to pass on the Sotshi track, so the departure is in a particularly big role.
And, of course, Bottas was allowed to answer the question whether he was driving the victory tomorrow or whether he was going to jesate the Hamilton approaching the MM title.
My starting point in the race is definitely that I'm trying to win.
When you leave the ball, there can be no other goal, Bottas.
But as a stable, we fight for both championships.
Lewis's lead to Sebastian Vettin is pretty big and the difference between me is very big, so it's got to be kept in mind.
Let's see what's going on, but Bottas is full.
After driving, Hamilton was truly happy with the success of Bottas, and Mercedes's taliman Toto Wolff also tasted.
Lewis was going to win Valtter, but he didn't succeed in a stand-up.
He knows he's gonna have to tear everything out of himself to win Lewis.
And he was so loaded that adrenaline was squeezed out of his ears, and Wolff was shining.
The question is whether the tall Bottas and Hamilton are driving honestly, Wolff responded by evading.
We'll talk tomorrow morning and see how the race goes.
Kitean Erno Kinnunen achieved the Finnish Championship of the rally
The SM series of rallies rarely ended.
I don't think the brothers have ever ended up at the same time as the champions of Finland.
It was now done by the Eerik and Henrik Petersburg in a decision rally in Turu and Salo, since Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 class.
Kiterian Erno Kinnunen ensured his career's best accomplishment when the third place of the contest sealed him from the SM4 class of the Finnish championship of two-way cars.
The Kinnunen and the map reader Ville Mäkelä, who competed with Honda Civic, started the Turku's stakeout because the starting points were clear: the investment group would guarantee the SM.
In the dark of Friday night, two-two had to give a levelling when some of the additional lights were betrayed by another special test.
That's the kind of blindness of a third piece.
In a situation like that, it's not a good thing to do.
On Saturday, Jussi Tepo, who was in the second series, was only followed, Kinnunen told me.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister calls on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
The Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, says that foreign forces must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign forces are in Syria fighting terrorism, and the war against terrorists is "nearly over".
In his UN speech, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return to the country.
However, there is no end to the seven-year war.
There are more than 360,000 people killed in the war.
Union Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany told us that in October there are plans for a Syrian meeting to be attended by the French, Russian and Turkish presidents.
Not exactly Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court's TV drama.
The Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, received an exceptional number of people on the screens.
In the U.S., at least 20 million people were appointed by the Supreme Court in full power on Thursday.
At that time, Kavanaugh, appointed by Donald Trump and the Californian professor Blasey Ford, who accused him of harassment, were in front of the Senate's judicial committee to tell his story.
According to the preliminary results, the consultations were followed by six main channels, namely ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC, totalling 20,4 million viewers.
In addition, a number of millions more followed the online consultation.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people followed the lifetrim and CNN reported having made its record of the year with 8.2 million live broadcasts.
The CNN figure will rise to more than 10 million, according to the calculation of the followers of the shipment via Youtube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got to 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are own channels, TV viewing figures are from the research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they are dizzy anyway.
Few reach 20 million.
More than 20 million spectators in the United States usually only reach sports games and great Oscar and Grammy games in the entertainment world, as well as occasional political events such as presidential talks and also presidential controversies in 2016.
For the U.S. annual most viewed program, the final match of the American football team NFL to Super Bowl is certainly a journey.
This year, Super Bowl collected about 103 million people on the NBC channel.
Last year, according to Nielsen, the first talk to the Congress by Trump totalled about 48 million people and 30 million people who were fair in office.
It's a matter of paramount importance.
The nomination of the Supreme Court is an extremely important case in the United States, because the positions are lifelong.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died from the beginning of 2016 and the Republicans succeeded in preventing President Barack Obama from appointing him a successor.
Another place opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced that he was retired this year.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was on several issues called the language of the vaa'an, whose voice could rule on the position of the Nineth Court.
He was the advocate of abortion rights and sexual minorities and decided, for example, in 2015, in his voice that those of the same sex received marriage rights throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative.
His choice to the highest court may be locked in the right for decades of conservative overpower.
Children have the right to know their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see Kanta's health data.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation in Kanta was, of course, even more worrying in the first place: parents could not even look at the health data or the recipes of small people.
The situation was provisionally adjusted in autumn 2016 for persons under the age of 10.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken an amazing time to repair.
Now the repair is under promise - in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, the change of the legal basis should not have been more than a matter of call.
After that, the understanding of the secular is about the button pressing: when the stick is now closed, it will be opened.
Of course, the child can show his or her parents his or her information if he or she has bank IDs or an official identity card.
But how many people are ten years old?
Identity card is payable, and bank IDs are not even available to a 10-year-old.
Thus, the data of a four-class undergraduate school can hardly be seen in practice by anyone other than by asking for them in print.
It's not as much the right of parents as the right of children.
It is extremely important for the care of the child that parents may be involved.
Of course, the right of adolescents to privacy must be ensured.
Even minors may have family situations where all matters cannot be discussed freely.
Often they relate to sexual health, for which free care is deeply relevant human rights.
In the U.S., the FBI initiated the suspension of Kavanaugh's harassment charges.
According to the U.S. media, at least two women have been investigated by the FBI.
One of the women earlier this week was at the hearing of the Senate Judicial Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment during his studies.
U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investigate charges at the Senate's request.
The investigation must not take longer than a week.
According to Washington Post, this is a criminal investigation into an unlimited investigation, and it doesn't necessarily become public.
The man threatened to kill police at the police station in Kajaan.
A fixed raider continued to pull onto the chamber.
The police say they've put a man in police prison to "relax."
The police were threatened by a suspect assaulter on Saturday night in Kajaan.
The official will inform you of the case that started when a fair 30-quarter man challenged a strong fight in the central hall.
The man first assaulted another client inside the nutrition store.
This led to the removal of the restaurant.
Outside, the fighter attacked another man by dropping him down.
When the third party tried to interfer, he still hit him.
Trial malpractice led to a police call.
The police have taken him and taken Kajaan to the police station.
The suspect was still aggressive at the police station.
He kicked another cop on his leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the cops.
The police say they've passed a man to the police prison to calm down.
The man is suspected of three assaults and violent opposition of the official.
Aid organisations are preparing to start work at Indonesian Sulawes - "Pure water is the most urgent"
UN Children's Organization Unicef and other international aid organisations are ready to help in the island of Sulawes in Indonesia, reports Finland's Head of Information on Unicef Kirsi Haru.
Local authorities are leading rescues, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
Unicef operates almost in all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, Unicef is always fully equipped with emergency assistance, says Haru.
The first task now is to find people in the ruins, both survivors and dead.
In the city of Palu, Sulawes, rescue measures are under way, but the situation in the Donggala region is a little more northern than that.
There are still places where connections don't work.
Aid measures are difficult because the roads are also broken, says Haru.
The constructions are often light structures in Sulawes, so the disasters caused by the earthquake and the tsunami are great.
Once the survivors have been found, they need protection, for example, from tents and clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent in crisis situations.
First, people are most often able to offer water cleansing tablets that are also stored in Unicef.
Water systems are intended to be repaired as soon as possible, but in an emergency, water is first transported by, for example, trucks.
In crisis situations, many children get rid of their parents.
The search for family members and the reunification of families is one of the areas of work of Unicef.
Food aid will also be organised, among other things, as part of the UN, by the World Food Programme (WFP).
In the initial item, funds previously collected are used for emergency assistance.
However, among others, Unicef has already started a fundraiser to help the victims of the Indonesian earthquake and the tsunami.
The billionaire Elon Musk will terminate as president of Tesla's government - $20 million fines on Twitter
Elon Musk, the founder of spacecraft and electric car manufacturers, avoids fraud charges by agreement with the US Securities Commission.
The billionaire Elon Musk ends his duties as president of Tesla's government and agrees to a $20 million fine.
Musk is withdrawn as part of a contract concluded with the US Securities Authority.
By agreeing with Musk to avoid fraud charges.
The US Securities Commission SEC threatened Muskia with fraud because of the tweets she sent in August.
In those cases, Musk wrote that he was preparing for Tesla's withdrawal from the stock exchange, which led to a rapid increase in the company's share rate.
According to the agreement, Musk may not serve as President of the Tesla Government for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint its government as a new "independent member" and take two "independent leaders" from its management group.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor the communication of Musk.
Musk will still be the CEO of Tesla.
In addition to the personal fines of $20 million in the musk, Tesla also has to pay the corresponding fines of $20 million to the financial supervisor.
The Twitts mislead investors.
According to the SEC, the Musk tweets led investors and Tesla shareholders astray.
Musk claimed that he would have secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private shareholder.
According to billionaire tweets, the company would have been purchased from the stock market at a share price of $420.
Tesla's share rate rose by more than 10 per cent per day after the tweets, but fell later.
According to the SEC, Musk's claims had no basis.
According to the overseer, he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
Nor had he discussed the withdrawal of the stock with the other management group or the company's government.
This week, the course fell by 14 per cent when the SEC Securities Supervisor reported a fraud charge.
The new agreement is expected to confirm the company's course again.
The last sentence is not a reason.
Of course, the watches of the church do not ring when the wise men do not move.
It's a technical defect.
The tower in Helsinki has stopped.
Wisdoms show at 12:00.
The situation is like a mediocre picture of horror: even though the church's crypt belonged to exile and the horns would call themselves.
Of course, this is not the case, but the clock has stopped for technical reasons: it's broken.
It's been seen by the repairer, but some part of it is broken and there's a new part to be expected, says Suntio Eveliina Jamsen.
At the same time, Jamsen confirms the fact that the Church in Helsinki has already mentioned in the Twitter account.
In fact, the account states that the last sentence is not the reason for stopping the clock.
Jamsen tells me the church's watches aren't ringing because of the fault.
