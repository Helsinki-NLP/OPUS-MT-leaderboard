Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have any secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I have a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom now lives in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that.
Good morning.
Do you like juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh so much.
Tell me what you're getting at the exams.
I think two languages aren't enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter's a nurse.
I think we should talk.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at three.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I won't lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The raw fish isn't my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a junior high school student.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is he okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do this right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the green house.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How's things in Boston?
I got promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please close the door.
Garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you tell her to do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
Everything that shines is not gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
My phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everybody knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Whose is this?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.

My name isn't Kuzay.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a pool of hippies.
The water's hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was urgent.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Has anyone come?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom will live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than in the past.
Tom is no longer my friend.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they're coming back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you paint your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
Every day I walk.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We might need some.
That's a suggestion.
How did you spend your vacation?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Oh, do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find them for you.
What's your name?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom caught Mary.
He's from France.
Why are you mad?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who that is?
Did you see baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It's the same for me either it comes or it doesn't.
I don't understand English.
It's not a matter of money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like people.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I won't be long.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
Sort of.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
He closed the 40s.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain's welcome to us.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
What do you call that?

My office is downtown.
She has two sisters.
You're not a Canadian.
I visited Boston many years ago.
Tom questioned Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letter is written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks French steadily.
I'm taller than you are.
Have you lost the receipt?
Are you afraid you don't lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom is coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.

I'm gay.
You're easy to trust.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I could help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
Those keys aren't mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They were wrong.
I say it and I say it again.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Do you learn Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.

Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.
I don't want you to tell her.

Don't apologize.
He's walking slowly.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
His father's a Japanese?

Spread the towel and put it on the shelf for the towels.

Tom and Sue have known each other since 1985.
Do you speak Chinese?
I have two mother tongues.
I won't sue you.
What happened?
We heard the news that you passed the tests.
There are happy people and unhappy people.
We're not the only Canadians here.
I'm looking for Tom.
What the hell was I thinking?
Tell them I'm here.
I assumed you were Canadian.
I thought you were Canadians.
Where's her family?
Tom runs every day?
Thank you for helping me!
I don't want them.
I'll be back in ten minutes.
I want to thank everyone for their prayers.
Open fire!
We went to church every Sunday.
Tell her we'll be ready.
Can I walk you to the front door?
He's still studying.
I don't want them.
Tom ran.
She's not my wife.
I want to know what's in the box.
She's younger than your sister.
When do your holidays start?
Tom danced.
What did you tell them?
I've already talked to Tom about it.
Vatican is the smallest state in the world.
I want to drink some water.
I'm not sick.
He was busy.
Get out of my office!
What would you advise me to do?
Tom doesn't hate you.
The computer you use is slow.
I left the door open.
Tell him not to come.
He ate all the apple.
I'm not kidding.
I'm bored.
It's different.
I just moved in.
What did you expect Tom to buy?
You're smarter than her.
I want this TV.
She's tired.
In an hour, we'll be done.
I'd like to write a book about Cyprus.

Tell them.
As far as I know, Tom could be dead.
She's smart, isn't she?
Tom is always willing to help.
Thanks for coming, guys, I'll see you tomorrow.
Tom and I are both Canadians.
We're students.
Does anyone know Japanese?
Tom's not smart.
He was born rich.
That's a flag.
Tom agreed hesitantly.
I'm playing violin.
Pick up your things and get out.
You'll be surprised what you can learn in a week.
I don't know where you're going.
I want a green one.
We have to get out of here.
They told me to wait here.
Why are you so sad?
Tom was forced to walk to school when he was young.
They robbed me.
Only we can save them.
I guess somebody must like Tom.
He always works a lot.
You destroyed him.
When did you get here?
I know myself very well.
We'll find one.
I told my friends.
I think we could help each other.
I live in Milan.
Tom wouldn't believe us.
Am I your friend?
I may admire other people but I never tried to be someone other than myself.
I don't trust women.
I recommend you read this book.
Can you find it?
Please correct the next proposal.
Tell me if I need to make some changes.
What is the most read book in the world?
The iron sticks to the boil.
Is this book yours?
You're a lot smarter than me.
Tom's about the same age as you.
That's the target.
My grandson's crying very loud.
Can you take over here?
We need more coffee.
I'm fine, thank you.
I'll be ready.
What are you gonna drink?
What color is your dress?
No one will know.
He decided to cut the cigarette.
We're closing at 2:30.
I never hit Tom.
Looks like he lied.
You won't like what I'm going to say.
When are you leaving?
What time does the store open?
I don't know French.
You ruined him.
From your mouth and to God's ears!
You shot her.
They like you.
Water's not drinking.
Does she eat the apple?
You'd better stay here.

We're all trying to help you.
The girl is beautiful.
I'll come with you.

Where do you work?
They're actors.
Can you speak my language?
You're not going to Australia to build shops?
I like your shirt.
Tell them I'm ready.
I'm in bed.
Australia is a beautiful country.
Of course every religion has its own rules.
I know where Tom was born.
Go straight until you see the post office and then turn right.
You don't have to talk so loud.
Tom eats a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He'll walk.
You're ready.
We recognized it.
She's on a diet.
You're sick, you have to rest.
Tom is obedient.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadians?
Suddenly I started to take weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
That's Ali's book.
It was my husband's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.
I've got ten pens.
I appreciate that.
Have you paid all the bills?
Did you buy flowers?
Tom's approaching.
You told her.
Don't push the dog's tail.
Tom's mad at us.
I bought you red roses.
Tom made Mary cry.
He won a phone.
You look tired.
Not a lot of people like Tom.
You're stronger than me.
Tom's still in Australia.
I heard you.
Ask me tomorrow.
Tom tells me he doesn't care if you like it or not.
Forgiveing others is an act of kindness to yourself.
My goal is to learn your language.
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
I thought you were Canadian.
It was a bad choice.
Take my handkerchief.
I woke up and saw my briefcase was missing.
What have you eaten?
I think I can hear them.
My neighbor's name is Tom.
I visited Tom many times in Boston.
We have wine.
Did you tell them about us?

At first I couldn't figure it out.
Tom likes fruit.
That was my box.
He started singing.
He speaks French.
We all want prices to fall.
It must work hard.

Kiss me, Tom.
"Are you tired?" "No, not at all."
Hey, nobody translates my suggestions!
I like turtles.

I want you to die.
No one lives there.
Look at my arm.
Tell them not to be late.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm proud of you.
The sea is green.
They're bigger than you.
Are you having fun?
Why are you mad?
Tell them I'm ready.

The cat's safe.
He doesn't drink coffee.
Do you need them?
There's a man at the door.
Tom has worked in Australia.
Most of the participants are from Australia.
Tom ate fast.
Tom was hired in October.

I remember them.
Are you working Monday?
I don't know how much Tom makes.

Are you talking to me?
A small step for man, a giant leap for humanity.
You need to hear the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.

Do what you think.
Stop right there.
I'll talk.
Are you sure?
Her eyes were red from crying.
Are you taller than Tom?
Yesterday I went to the park with Mary.
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
He's awake.
I could do it in the morning.
I thought you were Canadian.
He can't even write or read.
Excuse me, what time is it?
We have three children.
Tell them to help me.

My job is to teach English.
That brings me great joy.
Tell them I won't do that.
I really like Boston.
I'd like to help you.
He cuts me off, Lord.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Try to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You're late yesterday.

Everyone likes money.

Plus, I don't like wearing socks.
Both of us are planning on attending your party.
Thank you for coming!

He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early.

You're a liar.
We're not guilty.

You hid the truth from me.
His answer was negative.
I understand them.
You're still alive.
How old is she?
Tell her not to come.
Is Tom really Canadian?
Tom plays tennis every day.
It's not cheap.
She's a very attractive woman.

You're Canadian, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?
Tell them I'm not here.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
Right.
We're honest.
I woke up at five.
Tell them we'll be ready.

How far is it from Brenno?
Let's hope it works.
Tell them you're sick.
I was hiding.
He's out of his mind, isn't he?
What are you gonna eat today?
Tom is Canadian.
Did you kiss?
We've been warned.

I'm not very good at that.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We're all Canadians here.
Tom made some mistakes at the test.
Tom's gonna cook.

I see.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom will obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right road.

When are you having a birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be determined later.
No one's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a lot of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend's here.

Tom sent you?
Tom laughed.
I've lost my pen.
How is that word pronounced?
He saved me.
I got an idea.

It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.

You have 30 days.

Russian is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother tongue in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the democracies of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you were coming.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm older than her.
Why don't you tell them?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How old are you?" "I'm twenty-three years old."

I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good appearance.
What are you gonna tell Tom?

We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car is dirty.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.

Tom must be over 30.
Help me get him up.
Tell them I'm ready.

I'll be with Tom.
About 600 languages are in the process of disappearance because of English.
Did you call them to the party?
I hadn't imagined it would be that easy to do.
Are you new?
There was a big castle in my town.
He's in front of the door.
I think they're just going to Australia to have fun.
Tom's cheeks are red.
I'm Richard.
What did you open him up with?
Would you like a reservation on a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom will understand.
Where did he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthday last night.
Tom has a Canadian passport.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom has never asked me for money.
He helped me a lot.
Airplanes enable people to travel long distances quickly.
Don't you have anything better to do?
In my opinion, you're beautiful.
Let's all go home now.
With the rain stopped, the game started again.
Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We've been well prepared.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like putting me to bed, don't you?
Is it raining?
He's very slippery.
They'll hear us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I consider him my friend.
What were you doing there?
It'll be time for you to understand.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does Tom know French?
These cars are built in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I work at a bank.
We'll stop you.
The overheating of the planet is in orbit to turn the peaks of the mountains into simple rocks into less than one hemisphere.
"Did you do this Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
He loves Tom, not me.
I'm pretty strict with that.
Cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Pick whoever you want.
I live on Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The kids are sleeping.
You seem disappointed.

You're much faster than me.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me that's not true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog is white.
When are you coming?
Mary is my wife.
Looks like someone's calling you.
How many tickets did you get?
I've never been to Paris.
Tom has visited Australia three times.
It's snowing today.
I heard voices.
No, thanks, I'm not drinking beer.

I rarely eat outside.
On your knees!
Please, hurry up.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
Did you invite them to the party?
You need to clean up your class.
What are you laughing at?
We have a lot of schools.
Mary's blackmailing Tom.
He doesn't speak; he screams!
You're from Australia?
They won.
What were you eating?
We're proud of Tom.
Horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
Love what you're doing.
What football team do you support?
I'm up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom squeezed his fists.
They ate at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I won't tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom's unmarried.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We're gonna make it.
That's easy to say, hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When's he coming?
Australia is a nice country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care if you go or not.
It was weird.
No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everybody knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're older than her.
Let me make my position clearer.
I never understood that.
She's washing her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will show.
I won't be there.
We didn't know who it was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.
Tom's not fair.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom is not your brother.
Where are you friends from?
I had too much coffee.
He likes walking.
The man is young.

What does she want?
Stop your stupidity.
Our university has a good library.

I'll sit with you.
I'll call you tonight.
I'm from Kyoto.

Can I have one of these?
Give me the pepper, please.
Was anyone in the car?
That's my baby.
No one moved.
It's not an easy language in French.
Tom came home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're older than her.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He was accused of nepotism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom had to accept things as they were.
How old are you?
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was Greek.
It was mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill us all.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom in the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
Let me make my position clearer.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.
You never cared about me.
The thief disguised a cop.
Can I come up with you?
I thought we could stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be fighting all the time.
Tom gave me 30 bucks.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew it all along.
Everything went well.
I've been asked a question by the Emilia.
Tell them to come and see me.
You played.

There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope I see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
Everyone agreed to his idea.
Come quickly.

Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
He met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French to English.
It was empty.
"Thank you." "Please."
I have something to say.
Everybody's waiting for Tom.
Did Tom do this to you?
You need to help your friends.
I won't lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You don't contribute enough.
You're my best friend.
Tom's achievements are impressive.
Give me everything you have.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me here alone.
Tell them it's important.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too old for Mary.
Who found out the phone?
He forgot to turn off the light.
Give me 30 minutes.
They seem happy.
They work hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You destroyed it.
You have a few books.
We're ready to help.
What did your teacher ask you about?
Tom loved Mary very much.
Is this yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's afraid I'm gonna be lost.
I'm very tired.
I want to learn guitar.
Do you like your car?
He was elected mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It makes my life a martyr.
Tom gave me this tie.
I wish I had been born Canadian.
I miss her.
You were happy?
She's happy.
You're incredibly stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like kids.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need it.
I like dancing.
You got the wrong key.
I thought Tom was Canadian.
They were young.
He died fast.
Are you angry?
What are you doing?
Tom's a mathematician.
Are you a friend of Tom's?
How did you lose it?
Every year the world population increases by an average of two per cent.
Tom was the main suspect.
I thought you were Canadian.
I would never think I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
Are you speaking Hebrew?
Who did Tom sell his car to?
You're very curious.
Come here right away.
They speak French.
We have to finish everything by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband deceives you.
Tom's obedient.
The merchants only look at the profits.
He married him for his money.
Many people in the world like spicy food.
Mary's playing piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to sleep now.
I want to live in Brazil.
Do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English is not my mother tongue.
Will you give me your number, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like him.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I always listen to music; I can't live without it.
It's gonna be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
Today I got up from 7:00 in the morning.
What the hell did Tom mean by that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus stop so I wouldn't lose the last bus.

This house isn't too big.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept at 10 yesterday.
You still haven't told me who you are.
I have as many books as Tom.
I like this song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
There's a pile of books on the table.
We should choose the right person for each position.
Think first!
Do you trust this man?
Who's gonna count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't get close to the dog.
Yes, I'm coming!
Tom misses his wife and children.
Where did you go on Sunday when you passed us?
Hold both your hands on the wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was she born?
That's unprecedented.
No one ever came to see me at the hospital.
You're not 30.
Everything was great.
It's very fun to listen to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, though the smile lasts only a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother's here.
Betty's been here lately.
Did he admit it?
It seems to me that you don't often help other people.
Wait, I need to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were fighting to survive.
We're not afraid.
You want that?
You're not yourself.
It was yours.
The house is too big for us and besides it is very expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're smiling.
"He kissed you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on deck.
I have more money than you.
Tell me about your son.
You still live on Park Street?
Unlock the door.
He's so young.

Nonsense!
I just did what Tom asked me to do.
Tom told us not to be afraid.

Two beers, please.

Lock the door.
That fact moved me.
Let me make my position clearer.

Are you alive?
He's a good singer.

Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The streets are covered in snow.
How happy I am today!
I can't see you.

I assumed you were Canadian.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to a Canadian.
I'll wait for you here at 2:30.
The rejection hurts.
I hope this goes on.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What did you say to them?
Come with me to Boston.
Do you swim often?
I felt awkward with so many people seeing me.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom painted his hair black.
Yeah, I'll be right there.

Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy it?
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and set me up for dinner.

When did you buy it?
Tell him to go.
We want to create the smallest possible turmoil.
We were born the same day.
You're indecisive.
She promised me she'd come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.

Where do you work?
Nice suit.
Please come before 2:30.

We can't change the story, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom has money.
Asshole!
It's not raining.
Tell them you're not ready.
What are you going to order at the restaurant?
Let's wait for Tom.

Didn't you read the story?
It weighs over 80 pounds.
My parents are in Australia.

My little dog's in an easter.
My name is Farsand.
I love Tom.
We were both tired.
Don't leave me alone.
Haven't you learned anything from your mistakes?
