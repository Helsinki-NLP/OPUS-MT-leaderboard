A 28-year-old cook master was found dead at the shopping center in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who moved to San Francisco was found dead in the local shopping mall's stairway this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he doesn't know anyone who would have wanted to hurt him, and says, "He was finally doing well."
The body found at the Westfield Mall Shopping Centre on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco Frank Galicia, said by the San Francisco Investigator's Office.
The San Francisco Police Department said that death was identified as a murder and that the investigation is under way.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC channel of KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously served as a line cook in Boston, had received his dream job as a master of the line kitchen at the Sanfranciscoan Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters' representative said that they are "terrified and shocked" because of his death.
"We have a small team that works as a close family, and they will miss him very much," the representative said.
We're sending our thoughts and regrets to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia said that Frank spent the night at the hostels, but that recently, "he was finally doing well."
"He found the apartment and dated a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He was kind and had a great heart.
His way of feeling like a family was to make us food, to make dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of dispute.
He was a brother who drove along with the power.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, he was a smooth diamond that shined brighter every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on this matter is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tipline number 415-575-4444.
Medical practitioners strike: Requirements for new work measures
The representatives of medical practitioners have asked their trade union to adopt new work-fighting measures in their dispute regarding the new agreement.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) calls on the Council as a whole to support new work measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that ministers have failed to address concerns regarding the agreement.
Medical practitioners and medical students voted in July to reject the agreement agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the voters.
On Thursday night, in a letter published through Twitter to members of the JDC President Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "silently silent" on issues that he said led to the rejection of the agreement.
He said: "In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement and to call for formal re-conciliation of all your concerns."
In response to the Government's silence, the JDC Government has today made a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to obtain authorization for a progressive and expanding work programme beginning early in September.
The dispute has been followed by the participation of medical practitioners in this year's six strikes, including the first complete work-sharing in the history of the NHS health care system.
The Director of BMA's medical practitioners, Dr Johann Malawana, divorced after the vote had been rejected, the terms recommended by BMA.
He had told the members of the BMA that the agreement was good and should be accepted before the vote of 54,000 doctors and students.
After the vote, the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be assigned to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external association?
Ele, who ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to hand each other and to declare the eight-month fight for words and economic sanctions officially ended.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the golden hall of Peter's Palace, I had a clear impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
Yes, they handed it over.
But Putin's smile seemed violent, and he did not very much defy heat, even according to his own controlled standards.
On the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdoga kept talking about his "loving friend" Putin five times according to a report.
I lost my bills.
He also swore that relations with Russia would return not only to the pre-crisis level, but even to a better level.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan's behavior as if nothing bad had ever happened.
In my opinion, his zeal portrayed the opposite.
But the radiant cold from Putin showed that the leader of Russia hasn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the reason for the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at that time was fierce.
Putin attacked Ankara for stabbing Moscow in the back.
The wound was even worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real confidence will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The opinion of the Russian public has also changed since November.
For months, the state-run media led to an astonishing, thorough attack on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turkish people were responsible for everything.
The most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has benefited from the illegal oil trade in Syrian territory controlled by Iss.
He has strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move forward.
Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received an apology from President Erdogan.
Russia achieved some kind of victory.
The benefits of an agreement on a heavy weapon are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after he was almost removed from power in last month's failed coup d'état.
Continued terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's economic sanctions have been heavy, especially a ban on subscription flights, which usually carry several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast annually.
The amount has fallen by almost 90 per cent.
As far as Russia is concerned, local travellers and air carriers will certainly be relieved when flights are finally continuing.
They're hoping for a late season on the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state television has predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables since imports of agricultural products from Turkey are again allowed.
"The tourists there, the tomatoes back here," as drafted in the report of the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit also had political added value for Moscow.
In a harsh way, the Western countries are angry about what they consider to be a weak response to the attempted coup d'état.
With long-lasting resentment from the previous EU membership negotiations, Putin, who is keen to exploit the coolness and to break Turkey's ties to the Western countries, will emerge.
The Russian leader certainly received clear points from Ankara, where he called after the revolution to support the designated authorities.
Of course, this is a survival for Moscow, which has its own deep rooted fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in the Pramean Coastal Latts enabled Russia and Turkey to present the "external association", as one analyst described to me the situation: two countries that experience the Western countries abandoning them and mistreatment them, joining forces.
However, these two have great differences, despite public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently reconciled itself with the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be a lot of talk that after nearly three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed it.
The President of Turkey consciously avoided answering the question regarding their disagreements, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear agreement on where they can seek a common basis for Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a full catastrophe when NATO member Turkey shoots down a Russian warplane, it is certainly better that two leaders are still even talking.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland
According to the Bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to the back office role.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the Bank's international objectives.
After the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved, it has abandoned these goals.
At the time, the Bank's strategies have used the 'RBS' product mark to protect other consumer financing brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds used to sponsor international sport, Six Nations Rugby, Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it has been considered right to allow more national brands to come forward.
Royal Bank of Scotland is in use with Scottish customers, but it will not be re-started.
In England and Wales, all RBS references, with the exception of the main office and exchange lists, are converted into NatWesti.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for Irish and Northern Ireland customers.
There are other smaller private banking brands that get more visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed on a round of clients and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland that "RBS brand will become our investor brand and employer of our employees because we will become much more a brand bank now."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say that we no longer have global objectives, we have local objectives.
Each of these brands means something very different in their own communities, and our staff work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it does not continue the Six Nations sponsorship, and it has raised the profile of different brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is now time for us to move in the direction of the Brands Bank, because basically (we have been asking) it is about how we can focus on making this a better bank for customers," the CEO said.
Three years ago I would have been very cynical if we had said that we were going to be a great bank for customers and offer these brands.
But with the work we've done focused on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins in Newmarket with Predilection and achieves 3000 wins
Dettori sprays champagne after he has double wins.
Frankie Dettori, a hunter, confirmed his 3000th british failure in Newmarket on Friday.
On his second win, he reached the ridge on his home track by competing with the training of John Gosden at Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey who reaches this ridge in the race hunt.
He's following Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-fold master jockey dettori who won earlier at the Ghayar said, "This is special."
I'm very emotional because my family's here too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket because I started here 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not a Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humiliated.
Dettori is sucking himself in hobbies when he picks up Predilection after he wins.
Two chauffeurmen have reached this in the blockade races of a champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 winnings in his career that broke records.
Lester Piggot, 9-fold Derby winner, 4493 wins
Frankie is one of the best hunters of the present era, and it is not a surprise that he has reached this pit that only few have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical awkwardness will separate him from others in the weighing room.
He's a great ambassador to the competitions, his zeal and charisma have been pulling fans into the species for a couple of years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that she would have rode 6000 winners if she wasn't just a weekend and big jockey!
Seriously speaking, Frankie has been riding the winners in Britain for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a living person who's a good thing for British competition, but besides that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the flight landing of a saddle made up of a flowboat to a trademark.
From flying stops to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a mountain track.
Increased profits in big races, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane accident and suffered a ban on competition due to drugs.
Three years ago, he had difficulty beginning with his return after six months of ban on competition, but he showed significant strength in challenging suspects and returning to his best condition.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has said earlier that he would like to continue to compete until at least 50 years of age.
Russian Putin dismisses Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly dismissed Chief of Staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted interior for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
The Kremlin statement stated that Putin "destined Ivanov to move away from the functions of the Presidential Director of the Russian Government", but no reason was given to this.
Since 2012, the Deputy Director of Ivanov, Anton Vaino, has been appointed as his successor.
Persecution, 44, is a former diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn in 2012, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and served at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's protocol and government staff, said on the Kremlin website (Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as Head of State, as regards the drafting of laws and the management of the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told the Russian television station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his place and recommended that vaino be appointed to his place.
Are smiles convincing?
This is a movement that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest allies of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, served as the Soviet Security Service in KGB.
As Head of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff had withdrawn at his own request.
But despite smiling to cameras, only a few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just a second sign of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man who was once advertised as a potential candidate for the presidency suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been very dubiously accepted.
In his comments quoted on Kremlin's website to Putin Ivanov, he said "it is true that early in 2012 I asked you in the debate to give me four years of responsibility for this very complex, if you could even say the job, task.
Well, now I've been Chief of Staff for four years and eight months."
Ivanov accepted the mission in December 2011.
He was formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Service in KGB, as well as Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the head of the State Security Service at the FSB, which replaced KGB, Ivanov was appointed as his Deputy Director.
When Putin rose to power, he mentioned Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
One time it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Puti after the second season, because Puti's third season would have been contrary to the Constitution.
However, this mission went to another close Allied of Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister before his return as President only three and a half years later.
The Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson got a shoe after hitting a producer.
Last month, Gibson was involved in a physical dispute at the show scene in Los Angeles.
A series of producers, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his separation in a joint opinion.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, acting Gibson, made an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and quarrels at the scene.
I regret that it happened," he said in his statement.
According to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the FBI team series are expected later.
The 54-year-old star of the Dharma & Greg situation has been in the series since its first century in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I have given it everything I can for the last 12 years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I'd hoped I'd be involved until the end, but it's not possible now.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, our incredible team of work, and above all the best fans that the series can have.
The beginning of the 12th production season of the series has been planned for the 28th of September.
Mystery fish ended up in a garden in Banff.
The man who lives in Banff has asked for help to identify the fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be windscreens that have been left behind by a waterworm.
In Periscope, Bain, who lives 500 metres from the sea, published film material from the show hoping that someone could bring clarity to the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing Highway: The bridge now extends to Fifeen
The project of £1.35 is expected to be ready by May 2017
The engineers have combined the north deck of Queensferry's crossing point and the countryside, which means that the bridge now extends to Fifee.
It's the first of four bonds between the "civil threats" that are now graduating around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The bridge share of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 harnesses.
The project of £1.35 is now expected to be ready by May 2017.
Minister of Finance Keith Brown visited the country today and was among the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in building the Queensferry crossing point.
We are all witnessing truly impressive engineering work in this project, where more than 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel have been used alone to build this bridge part."
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the meltdown between the shore and the bridge deck is a demanding operation in which the extremely accurate dimensions must be agreed together.
All in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the last portion of the deck is lying in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: "The first shutdown of any bridge project is always a significant pier.
In this fantastic project, this closure represents the tip of construction technology.
When the last part of the road was installed and combined with the expanding northern pillar, then we had to close the remaining part of the north, that is to say, the inland side.
This was done by pulling off the northern road at 700 millimeters south.
This was a huge and, at the same time, a very demanding measure.
It is huge because it is 222 meters long from the ground, weighing about 6000 tons and was to be dragged around 3% in the angle of inclination.
Required, because the permitted deviations of measurements, according to which the team worked, were small, only a few millimeters in both directions.
I'm glad everything went well, though.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky when they're alive"
Three men are "lucky when they're alive" after they fell off their fishing boat in front of Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue boat station made an alarm at 1320 (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the event evolve in the Moelfre Bay Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim safely while their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and we thought the worst," said Vince Jones of the rescue boat of Moelfre.
"Fortunately, the strong wind had blown it away from them by the time we moved," he added.
The local fishing boat saved two men, and the third, 60-year-old man was found exhausted hanging out of the poppy without rescue gears.
The men were taken to the coastal rescue boat and brought back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said: "These three men in the water are lucky to be alive and completely harmless.
The boat's engine had a kill-off rope, but it had somehow cleared the boat from the driver when the boat fell.
Someone took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectful hunt for health and happiness
It's fascinating to see the world change.
Over the past decade, many have been concerned that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but that they prefer to spend their leisure time looking at the evidence.
Pokémon Go makes people rise up on the couch and participate in some activity.
The viewing time was initially limited to television, then to video games and now to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity do not close each other.
Of course, I refer to a wildlife called Pokémon Go. An application based on characters that were originally developed in the 1990s on video games (afterwards they created a drawing series, game cards and other subsequent products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity was somewhat diluted before this new game was published in the United States, Australia and New Zealand early in July.
Afterwards, the game was posted in other countries, as the huge popularity overloaded servers.
In only days Pokémon Golla had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
Then how does it work?
As explained in the nuts shell, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémons that are traced using GPS, and which after finding can be "photographed" (using the phone screenshot) or "shouldered".
A generation who played the game as a younger has been associated with wildlife and jumped up on the couch according to searches.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the daily steps of the average person.
The Apple Watch application Cardiogram, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that within two days of the release of the game, the number of people moving 30 minutes a day jumped from 45% to 53% in followers of the Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Gota, it only sees the level of training.
The invitations of many public health campaigns "to find 30", "to rise on the couch" and "to be active every day" have not produced any result because most public health warnings are boring and cares about people who seem unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be diminished.
Regularly-moving people are less likely to experience cancer or depression.
Activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Its benefits are too many here to be listed.
Pokémon Gon's fineness is that it makes people go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine and fun.
Some people even get new friends hunting.
As usual, the disgraceful ridiculers are looking for things to complain about.
Yes, someone can walk the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
Although earlier there were applications like Fitbit that could monitor activity, they did not give reason to move in the same way as this game.
The new attraction disappears and the use drops in time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there are other games that combine apps and virtual reality with the activity of the real world, helping many hunting people to be more active, better and healthier.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's multiplaying.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to everything.
Energetic in jumping.
It's good with the teams.
Unbelievable in a stay.
It's great everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympics winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnasticist achieved a multiplayer's championship on Thursday leaving the gap between himself and the rest of the world in the light bowl of the Olympics.
His total point, 62,198, was clearly better than the silver millist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronsimitalist Aliya Mustafina.
At the US Simone Biles Balance Party, the final multiplaying of women's feminine feminine teams at the 2016 summer Olympics in Brazil on Thursday, Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American woman who has successively won the championship of the multiplayer, and all in all, the fifth American champion. At the same time, he strengthened his reputation for his generation, and perhaps for all times, as the best.
He burst into tears when his final point was announced, and his long journey toward this moment ended.
This achievement raises his class to the same level of other generations of best athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who have raised their species to a new level:
Biles has ruled its species for the past three years, winning 15 world championships, including 10 gold, with programmes whose ambition and precision have been so astonishing that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "best to see him as a gymnast".
The final test was expected in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and other competitors, but between his and the overlapping expectations.
Returning home to Texas Spring without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
The United States Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after winning the gold and silver medal (in this order) in the final multiplaying of women's feminism at the 2016 summer Olympics in Brazil Rio de Janeiro on Thursday, August.
Biles reached the first medal on Tuesday when he served as the top coordinator of the retired national team, Martha Karolyin, at the departure party.
Although Biles claimed that he has never thought about the future as he travels long to the top of the world, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanent program, including his brand's volt flight, has been adapted to Latin American music, which would also be great for the street next to the Rio Olympics.
This isn't a coincidence.
This girl whose grandparents adopted as a backpack, and whose coach Aimee Boorman's mother found when she was on a study trip at the gym where Boorman trained, has become a power factor.
He hasn't lost in a multiplayer since summer 2013, and this winning pipe will continue as long as Biles wants.
Although Mustafina was in a small line after two rounds, it was just an illustration.
The Balance Force and the Permanence where Biles is the dominant world champion waited.
He rose at the top of the pole points 15,433 and crossed them by receiving 15,933 on a permanent basis.
Raisman hugged him with goodness when they waited for the end points - just formality - and the tears rose to Biles's glazed, white and blue-bound eyes, when the dream he once wrote his book of art came true.
Raisman's performance was some sort of reversion from four years ago when he was divided in third place, but lost bronze to Mustafina in renewal.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "grandmother," was clearly in charge.
He sent flight kisses to the public after his permanent performance in the emotions of a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As far as the Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old wide-ranging tweeting past this week gets a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in a serial murder were shot when they listened to music in the car
In the most fatal attack of the first serial murder of the last decade, Phoenix, two women died and a 12-year-old girl sat in the car to talk and listen to music when they were shot.
The authorities said that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road on June 12th.
The report tells us that the shooter standing on the passenger's side fired a handgun up to eight times and then ran off on another vehicle.
According to the police, the third murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take handbags or $2,900 for another adult victim.
The agent of the Phoenix police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that shooting led researchers to examine whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In all, seven people have died and two have been wounded during the nine attacks in four months, which have been carried out in two mainly Latin American districts.
"This is happening in the area of residence in front of the home," Howard earlier this month told the subsidiary of CBS to KPHO.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including the brown Nissan in the late 1990s, the black BMW in the late 1990s, and the white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers have not agreed to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks are interrelated and are perpetrated by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was injured in a hospital where he died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, died at the scene.
The eyewitness told the police that they often sat in a parking car listening to music.
The authorities also published a police bulletin about the shooting, which occurred only half an hour before the third murder and was the object of the empty open package car, which is also believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Scientists found bullet shells, a bullet seat, and bullet fragments in the engine space.
The mother of a 6-year-old who has microcephalia: "The situation is getting easier"
Edmund Picciuto, like most of the other six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But, unlike a large number of his agemates, Edmund is small-headed, a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, did not know when he was pregnant.
"When he first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't promise to do this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised," he said.
He and his husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund never necessarily learns to identify them, and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in institutional care.
"My main reaction was that 'I didn't know people were still doing it'," Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walk.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But he slowly reaches a few pillars.
He walks with help and drives a bicycle.
He also loves playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth will show you how the references made by Edmund indicate "can you sing to me"?
"We teach him the sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not an ordinary sign language, he says Edmund has invented some of his own signages.
Microcephal may be due to a number of different reasons: genetics such as Edmund's case, or pregnant viral infections, such as ash or Zika virus.
Symptoms and forecasts may vary greatly.
It's too early to say how it affects the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden caused by the uncertain future.
I was just asking what was going to happen.
What's going on?
And he still doesn't know.
In fact, I haven't asked for predictions in a while since I don't expect anyone to really give me that.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth failure due to Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's gonna be easier.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Rainfall and floods caused rescue operations in Mississippi in Louisiana
The heavy rain and the widespread floods in Louisiana caused the governor to declare an emergency on Friday, and more rain was expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reports that numerous rivers in south-east Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded over their crusts and caused extensive flooding due to extremely heavy rains.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana said that state authorities are constantly in contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to the constituencies that need it.
The governor's office of security and emergency warning, Mike Steele, said they're getting requests for high-water vehicles, boats and sand bags.
Steele said that the county of Tangi evil alone asked for tens of thousands of sand bags.
The flood guard is valid until Saturday in a large part of southern Louisiana.
In the opinion, the weather service said that three to five cents more rain are expected in the region.
In southern Alabama, the flood guard was in force on Friday, when the rain continued in the Mobile area.
The river Baton Rouge and the river Amite near Denham Springs are both located in Louisiana and are projected to set the flood peak record during the weekend.
The regulator Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood into several houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding of the Ascension district along the river is a threat when the flooding rivers slowly fall to Lake Maurepas Lake.
The Tickfaw River flowing south of the border of the state of Mississippi at Lousiana Liverpool was at the highest level of all times at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
The Saviors are still collecting people from floodwater in Amiten and Wilkinson County in South Mississip.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and nephew were near Gloster among the saved.
62-year-old Hansford says that normally more than 400 feet away from his house, Beaver Creek's water rose rapidly during the night.
He says that another close-up nephew warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just continued to rise," Hansford said.
It went all the way to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she has not seen a stream of water so high during the 48 years she has lived there.
Hansford said that both he and his family members have injuries, and that he is the only swimper.
Hansford said the rescue workers rescued a threesome in a military-style truck and took them to the Gloster fire station where the rescued men stayed on Friday night.
Krautmann says that the floods will "spread quickly" as hard roads continue, and that the authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that a witness near Livingston reports about 13,75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said that since Wednesday the country was completely bored with hardship.
The heavy rain and flooding of streets led to the rescue of the residents of the district of Tangi evil from their homes and the withdrawal of lessons in five school districts, the authorities reported.
The subsidiary of CBS WWL reported that a member of the City Council in Tangipahoa said that 200 homes were under flooding.
The residents were evacuated into two churches, but both of them are now under the flood.
The district president, Robby Miller, said that the authorities saved 72 people and 7 pets who had been caught up in the water.
The cities of Amiten and Hammond have been opened up for those who have been evacuated.
"They will be able to return to their homes when the water begins to fall," he said.
In the city of Hammond, in the district of Tangi evil, twenty streets were shut down because of rising water, and the inhabitants were able to pick up sand bags to try to keep the water away from their homes and movements.
"The last major flood here was in March," said the city administration Lacy Landrum.
This is going to be the same case.
In Mississip, Chief of Emergency in Harrison County, Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.
He said that on Thursday, a handful of houses were reported in floods, but no flooding has been reported until now on Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and the rain continues."
"Full bullets" was a six-year-old Mahaj Brown to survive the shooting of Philadelphia
The police report that six-year-old boys have been shot in Philadelphia, which means another six-year-old shot in the city this week.
The grandparents of the child told CBS Philadelphia his name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown had several gunshot wounds, including the neck, leg, hand and stomach, but he was conscious when he was transferred to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets," grandma Delores Melendez tells the station.
I can't believe it.
In the hospital, the boy's condition has been recorded as critical, and several surgeries have been performed for him.
The family tells the station he's expected to recover.
The boy was starting the first class at the local undergraduate school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot: two from 29 years of age and one from 32 years of age.
One 29-year-old male was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot at the front seat of the car in conjunction with a 29-year-old in critical condition, reporting station.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be a shooter.
Researchers tell CBS Philadelphia that it looks like there was a cross between several shooters.
Attack-type shells that come from different weapons filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a constant battle.
There were shells on the street on both sides of the aisle.
"So it seems that there were several armed fighters here, and that they were in active battle," said Anthony Ginaldi to the station, Chief of Police of Philadelphia.
Several houses and vehicles in the region were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the information received, the police are investigating surveillance camera tapes.
The second six-year-old, a girl, was hit by a delusional bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's how I call this year's women's Olympic gym team for more than one reason.
First of all, I have been at every summer Olympic since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And second: This team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of this team, which is complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocia, makes everyone proud.
This team looks, finally, like America.
It has also been established at the top of the species of dark and Latin American women.
For the last four years, the most successful female forcemaker has been an African American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were the first and the second.
This is great.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was surprised to win the Olympics, and America was cheering.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible performances of the three-fold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas, and Laurie Hernandez in which they present unexpected but master-made gymnastics programs.
On Thursday Simone became the fourth American woman who has successively won individual gold in women's multiplay.
And teammate Aly Raisman got silver.
We see the top of the species, but it doesn't look like this in gymnasiums across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie were all on the same path as Aly and Madison when they reached the Olympic team.
They are "Final Five" (the last five), because the next Olympic gym team will have only four gymnasts, and this is the last year of Marta Karoly's coach.
However, the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive species, and gymnastics are normally practised in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, spaces, trips, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaches and their gymnastics and families) and the list continues.
Many of these gymnasium clubs are located in prosperous suburban areas that can support species.
In these clubs the gymnasts receive all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the gymnasts.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both trained their athletes since they started training.
We need to bring more affordable and available training to communities where Simone, Gabby and Laurie are enthusiasted by numerous young girls.
I founded my gym foundation 20 years ago.
In my organisations, we have offered free and affordable exercises in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people (mainly blacks and Latins) and have trained national and international championships.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-level training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this important Olympic species.
Forcers develop body strength, flexibility and coordination, as well as mind hardship, discipline and determination.
This combination provides lifelong benefits for good health and for school and work gains.
This team's inspiration makes thousands of young girls begin to exercise, and it's great.
Participation in sports is so important, especially for girls.
We're living an exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing serious "girl power" by winning the Olympics' team trip, and for motivating so many young girls from different backgrounds to start on the road towards healthy, strong and successful youth benefits.
Medical practitioners organizing new strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials, but 58% of the physician practitioner who participated in the 37 000 votes rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying that NHS was "on an unknown soil", and that small additional delays damage staff and patients.
The first medical practitioners will be transferred to a new agreement containing changes to night and weekend working methods to improve treatment during hours of trouble.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee of Physicians, said last night in the opinion: "Medicians still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it accelerates the existing labour crisis and that it does not treat all doctors equally."
When the time before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new agreement remains only eight weeks, progress needs to be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been confronted with the government's desire to participate and, at times, with deep silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door will always be open.
"Jeremy Huntin should act now, remove the sanctions and take into account the concerns of medical practitioners.
If he does not do so, medical practitioners will be ready to continue working activities.
The last strike at the end of April meant almost 13 000 routine surgery and 100,000 reception times when nurses and doctors were recruited to serve as substitutes for doctors on strike guards.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to an improved agreement with British Medical Association officials.
BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 medical practitioners under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to medical practitioners to prevent them from going into strike.
Mortimer said: "Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on already demanding teams and services, and cause concern, anxiety and disturbance to patients, caretakers and their families."
Over the last two months, we have discussed with the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of monitoring (Guardia Role) and Whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that a continuous positive debate on other important issues - such as development, flexibility in education, additional training from the Sabbath, education costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, freedom of study and gender pay gaps in medicine - is a sign of how serious employers, the Health Education England Education Organization and the Ministry of Health are respecting the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May.
Two pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients with heart attack are benefiting from two pounds a day of liver therapy after the authorities recommended that it be given to humans longer.
A medicine to prevent blood clotting, ticagrelor, reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
The medicine is already given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another seizure.
NHS administrator NICE has advised that it should be given to humans for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart and blood problems.
But now NHS supervisor NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years in order to further reduce the risk of heart and blood problems.
Approximately 140,000 people get a heart attack every year in England, and a quarter of them get a second seizure or stroke.
Cardiac seizures and strokes are caused by the fat content of the artery's wall forming a stain.
If the hardship breaks, it can cause a blood clot that prevents the circulation of blood into the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks out, it can go along with the blood and cut down the bloodstream into the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already received one seizure have increased the risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the Spanish company AstraZeneca, and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making coagulation less likely.
The NICE draft guidelines today recommend that 90 mg of ticagrelor be given to humans for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the following two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of NICE's Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: "Despite the availability of effective preventive treatments, even a quarter of the people who have received a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, the consequences of which are often destructive."
Fear of renewal may have a significant negative effect on the quality of life of the person.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of later heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
When we provisionally recommend ticagrelor, we are pleased to increase available treatment options for many thousands of people who may benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially regarding the risk of bleeding - have been limited over three years, the draft guidance is not recommended for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness allows for the blossom of elections in Muslim regions
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed last year because of corruption, giving a boost to the government report.
The culture of political correctness has led to the disregard of the widespread voting fraud in Muslim communities, which is revealed in today's shocking government report.
Former Minister of Government Sir Eric Pickles blew up the police, electoral overseers and city councils because they have ignored evidence of the electoral vileness due to "the hypersensitivity of race and religion".
The former secretary of the Community, the current emperor of anti-corruption, said that the intimidation of voters on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to set up guard chains to protect voters who have been frightened.
He recommends that voters present an identity certificate when voting to prove who they are.
Nowadays, the voter only has to say his name and address.
The report even proposes that the finger of the voter be put on an unforgettable ink so that no one can vote twice.
You should protect people better, Sir Eric says.
He calls on the press to have greater access to the documents and decisions of the delegation taken by the informal committees or the working group.
"This would not only protect the elections, but would protect the local government from a broader culture of corruption and economic fraud, which runs hand in hand with the electoral elections," he said.
The government ordered a report as a result of the East London Tower Hamlets vote scandal.
Last year, the Special Election Court decided that the sitting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office as a result of numerous allegations of corruption and illegal action.
The Court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" his Muslim community's religious feelings and silenced his critics' accusations of racism and fear of Islam.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the basis of the religious obligation of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
Even 300 voices were predictable or the result of a person's vote being performed as someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern about voting on the election ballot by mail, where members of the Higher Muslim Community were said to have pressured people to vote on the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, made a number of recommendations on cleaning the voting system, including proof of identity by identity certificate
He says: "The evidence was presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in those communities with a Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There was concern that... State institutions had ignored such behaviour because of the 'political correctness' of race and religious hypersensitivity."
Sir Eric put forward 50 proposals to clean up the system, which included denying political activists to deal with posted ballot tickets in order to end the 'choice of votes'.
The report, which Theresa May is considering, also calls for more stringent amendments to those registered in order to prevent the use of the electoral register for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for proof of voters' identity before voting.
Use an unforgettable ink on the finger of a voter so that no one can vote twice.
Conduct systematic nationality reviews to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for an automatic mail vote.
Prevent political activists from dealing with the voices and envelopes made available via the mail where they are sent.
Let the police set guard chains around the polling stations.
Change the law so that it is easier to blame people for intimidation on the basis of the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make the photo illegal at the polling stations.
Demand that only English (except in Wales) should be used in voting places.
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the provision that the voter should go to the club alone.
Sir Eric's fencing the police force in Great London, saying it's "amazing" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court was left behind by Lutfur Rahman and his official as a result of numerous acts of corruption and illegal action," he said.
On the basis of numerous grounds, he was found guilty without doubt, according to the threshold of criminal evidence.
He also criticised the ineffective "radical checks" of municipal councils' voting registering agencies.
Sir Eric said, "The last year's Tower Hamlets sentence was a wake-up.
Our nation has a splendid legacy as the creator of parliaments, but this worrying and secretive spread of the electoral blasphemy and the prohibition of certain groups' facts threatens this good reputation."
Crazy to Kate's biker double-show and other famous famous pictures at the Rio Olympics
This week, the fans of the Rio Olympics 2016 have gone a little messed up with the French biker Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who has been proven to be Cambridge's impressive twin being.
But a 24-year-old olympian is certainly not the only athlete fighting gold this summer who can brag on his own famous double race - at least according to social media.
So, in honor of the Rio races and all the famous faces presently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who clearly look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: The United States men's archery team member Brady Ellison, on the left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's double track, many people online have been quick to note how a certain arc booth could be a star of Leonardo DiCaprio's twin.
Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter since he rose to the surface of his pictures, where he seems scary as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street.
And in fact, when he became aware of the social media agitation, he admitted that he had heard from the child that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see a great resemblance, except for maybe a beard," Brady told Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London in 2012 will certainly also emerge this year: a stunning resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The largest, obvious eye of the Russian gymnasticist Alya Mustafina has been said to be the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan's twinsolennon.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgia has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
Greater change in the eye: This user thinks Nathan is the "sports version" of Inception's actress
The second long-term comparison has been between the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, both with similar strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than the same actress Annalynne McCord as brownish skin and blonde hair, while the American team Nathan Adrian reminds fans of "Joseph Gordon Levitt's sport version".
Hard Women: Football Star Hope Solo, on the left, and Dexter Actor Jennifer Carpenter, on the right, sharing similar face shape and eyes
Not only: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
Presentation of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a couple of similarities.
One Twitter user recently expressed his happiness on the website that "others on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical."
And the U.S. football star and Dexter's actress really have an incredible similar face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and his smile, which is almost identical with the smile of the actor Laura Linney, as well as the gold medal won the gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose own beautiful wide smile matches Bring It On -star Gabrielle Union's smile.
CBC's Olympic Commander apologizes, saying the Chinese swimmer "dead as a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of the 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth message of women's 4x200-metre free swimming ravaged CBC's direct Olympic broadcasters on Wednesday.
The Canadian television company CBC has had to apologize since one of its reporters said during the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "lost like a bad smell" and "dead like a pig".
Reporter Byron MacDonald thought that his mic was off when he began to share some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200 meters free swimming media final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC's reporter team to bring colors, was heard saying, "That little 14-year-old man from China, baby.
Too zealous, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swimd at the second part of the message at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, which gave Canada the opportunity to catch China.
Viewers around Canada react quickly online after shocking the language used and its tone.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did the CBC reporter just say that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "did he die like a pig"?
The idiot didn't realize he was still in a direct broadcast."
China's Ai Yanhan was described in a 4 x 200-metre women's free swimming term as follows: "That little 14-year-old man from China is a scumbag, baby."
The review against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was loud and fast, when many challenged him.
Twitter users did not arrest themselves when they heard how careless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: "Wau #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist band. # disgusting."
Soon after that, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC broadcast, asked in direct broadcast for MacDonald's apology for his comment, saying: "We regret that the comment on the swimming performance was sent.
It was a sad choice of words, we are sorry that this happened."
CBC ended up apologizing more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
The reporter colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
After that, CBC copied and linked an apology to over 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The TV company also quickly apologized and published a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were sent straight.
Last night, we took action quickly and in a direct broadcast we apologized to our viewers and to our followers in the social media.
For the sake of clarity, it must be said that Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry to say.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized in a direct broadcast and tried to define his remark by stating that he did not mean it to be interpreted as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after a woman's message," he said in the CBC Olympics.
"I referred to the performance of the swimmer, not to him as a person."
"It must be unnecessary to say that I didn't mean it as disrespectful, and that I'm really sorry."
Primark's client was shocked by a woman who arrogantly adjusted underwear in the middle of the trade.
Customers didn't know where to look when a woman took off in the middle of Primark's movement to try underwear.
Things didn't heal the fact that after assessing what he looked like in his pants, a woman swept them off her head and put them back on the shelf.
He continued his tour and eventually arranged four underwear pairs in a store that was located at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone.
Primark's business at Bouverie Place's shopping center in Folkestone, where she arranged underwear and then put them back in the shelf.
At the same time, the mother of two children at the store, Jenny Davidson, said that after trying underwear, a mysterious woman "weared again and walked out of the shop without buying anything."
He said, "People didn't believe in their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took a couple of underpants, stripped her own socks and underwear, and put on her reconstitutable legs.
"He didn't even try to find a remote place to make a settlement, he just stood there ungrateful."
"Everyone stared when he took off his underwear again and clearly didn't like them because he put them back on the shelf."
He did the same for three more couples before he finally decided that he didn't like anything he saw, dressed again and walked out.
"He didn't seem to care who watched or thought of a person who would end up buying the underwear he made."
Davidson, a 33-year-old in Kent, said, "It's disgusting to think that someone is taking the underwear that someone else has tried, but not cleaned."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I asked that the staff apparently tried to remove the clothing pieces from the sale of a woman after she left, which is absolutely good."
"It would be terrible to go home with new underwear and find that another woman has worn them and stripped them off, and they have not been washed."
The representative of Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that took place in the movement of Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products in question have been removed from sales.'
In this way you can defend yourself against armed attacks by using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this Dailymail.com video can make it a little safer for you.
We talked to the Grand Master of the Krav Maga Federation in New York, Rhon Mizrach, to find out how to deal with gun robbers in the vicinity.
Then approached you from the front or the back, this video shows how you can pay the attacker on the same scale.
According to Mizrach, if you're being approached behind you, the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attacker and "raise the line of fire."
Then you catch the gun between the shoulder and the shoulder before you hit the attacker on the face with your free elbow.
Keep on hitting the knee in the neck, and when the attacker goes from the stone to the top, turn the gun off his hand, hit him with the gun behind his face and back off, keeping the gun directed at him.
If an armed person approaches the front, the technique is similar: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the gun and turn it around so that the criminal cannot launch.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then turn the gun on his grip, back off and point him with the gun.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video and see how Mizrachi exactly does this.
But remember, if you're not Krav Maga's great champion, the safest way out of the robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the most dirty places in Europe for travel guide
The British traveller has put a serious challenge to his immune system and vomiting reflexes by licking some of the most dirty and nocturnal places in Europe.
Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, would lick the euro banknotes, the Piccadilly Circus, the washing button of the train toilet and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of its immune system.
Before each target was licked, he used photometry to show himself and us the situation he was facing.
However, the experiment, which was made by a film called the Inner Power, produced surprising results.
The idea of the arrowing of a train by thousands of people may seem completely resentful, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in the kitchen lavatory.
On his way across Europe, Wright kept talking to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, none of his arrows left him anything else in the mouth of evil taste.
Wright became a well - known tester of his intestine endurance while traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This mission, from public railway stations, to the washing pressure of the toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In the film he said, "Since I was a child, I've been quite careless about my health, and I've put all sorts of things in my mouth since the mud, worms and strangled water."
He really confirmed his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
In his sample, more than 4,000 units were read in the photometer.
For the sake of comparison, the reading of counter-washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet he did not agree to arrow when the result of the photometer showed more than 4,000 units, and the result of the counterwashed hands is less than 60.
Wright has produced a traveler's film, following the Inner Power, together with the Finnish meyer, Valio. The film shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the film, the wedding said, "This is almost the worst thing I've ever smelled in the toilet."
There's nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because there's something to be over here.
Afterwards of the inner power was produced together with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright the Valio Gefilus, which contains milk acid bacteria as well as C and D vitamins that help to enhance human intestinal bacteria and immune systems.
The leader of the election of fires, juice and new categories Niko Mountainland said: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and at the same time explain the probiotics' interests.
We threw a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we ended up thinking, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Rather than just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: to tell us about our ark environment about good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and this documentary film allows us to tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the document also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, director of the document, added: "Let's say it now, even if Ian had licked some of the things I asked him for, like the nighty Russian toilet shown in the movie, I would have lost my respect for him."
Understandably, some of the lame things were easier for Ian, while some were rather difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those dirty arrows stored."
In the 2015 poll, 84 % of respondents linked milk acid bacteria specifically to the welfare of the stomach and intestines, and 58 % said that at least one time they use products that have added milk acid bacteria.
Orange family destroyed the rental house in Cornwallin Saltash, before the decision was taken.
The owl family caused damage to its rental house of 50,000 pounds after they were expelled because of the terrorization of neighbors.
Tanya Keldon and his partner Shaun Trebilcock have been thrown out of the property in Cornwallin Saltash since they had been complained numerous times.
After they had been removed from the property by force, the shocked employees of the housing company found the property to be in poor condition.
The walls had been made with foul holes, the floor plates had been torn, the waste had been spread on the floor and the walls had been wasted with graffiti.
The family has now moved elsewhere, and they are believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the host of Cornwall Housing, said he was afraid that the property could not be repaired.
He said: "This has been a real nightmare for the inhabitants, and I think people should not be forced to live this way.
There are many things to consider here, as this property is likely to be known through the less comfortable groups of Cornwall.
This family is undermining, and their name is undermining."
The couple had three boys who lived in the property at times, and according to the police, the horror of the family involved a street fight with baseball bats, intimidation of closest people, drug use, drug sales, and arrogant screaming, arson and curse.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, whose name was the contract of lease, took a decision in June on unsocial behaviour.
In many of the rooms under the demolition, there was an old waste.
The property that had previously been handed over by drugs, the floor plates had been trapped up.
Neighbors said that the family was seen fighting in the street, and that the police were called regularly.
Cornwall Housing expelled the woman and this partner's property this week by force after giving them the extended period, 11 weeks, time to change voluntarily.
Silent neighbors thanked the decision to say that their lives had become one hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived in their neighbors for 20 years, and the situation has always been bad.
We've seen a cop here incredibly many times.
"This morning we couldn't sleep.
We got up because it was so quiet here, we're not used to it!
I love it now that they're finally gone."
The executive director of Cornwall Housing, Adam Fitzpatrick, said that the family did not cooperate with local authorities.
The family has lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were often invited to the property
The trash and old toys have been thrown down on the wild wall of the rental house.
He added: "It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his or her own conduct, for the decision is always the last way that Cornwall Housing considered.
This was a very difficult case, because the behavior was extreme, and their actions certainly terrified neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the Devon and the Cornwall police and the courageous, informed community members.
I hope that this development will bring comfort to the neighbours and send a message that antisocial behaviour will not be accepted.
Fitzpatrick said that three boys all lived in the real estate at different times, but they were all in twenty.
Subsequently, a dirty mattress left on the floor of a single bedroom
The housing company's workers now have to clean up the house surrounded by waste piles
In 2014, the police raided the property and found more than 70 g of cannabis as well as vaa'a, supplies and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received fines after he granted his guilt for holding B-class drugs as an attempt to distribute it forward.
He claimed that the money was intended for his son Lee Skeldon's gravestone, which died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently Tanya and her associates live homeless after they've now stayed in private accommodation in Plymouth.
For many of the house's rooms, graffites were worn out.
The police say they're trying to get rid of the people who mock the rules of their rental contracts.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall said the decision was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to mock the rules.
"This is a message to those who think that their conduct is without consequences, as well as to those who suffer from such behavior," he said.
Devon and Cornwall's police will never tolerate criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Travellers in Portugal were terrified when a military shower machine flew off the beach down the hippo.
Solar worship tourists in Portugal's Aveiro experienced shock in their lives
The P-3C Orion airplane of the Portuguese Air Force would wipe out very low.
Air Forces said it was a training flight and claimed that safety was not compromised.
Right now, scary tourists began to panic when the low-flying jet wiped off a full beach.
Dramatic recording shows how the military aircraft became almost touched by sun worshipers in the Northern Portuguese Aveiro sand band.
The vacationers stood up when they began to understandably worry about the noises of the jet machine, even though they did not initially see what was coming from behind the clouds towards them.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many holidaymakers who published videos of a dramatic passage in social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said, "It went twice down, and one part seemed to be going down the ground."
Nuno Arroja added, "I was surfing and I really felt like a machine was falling on me."
The tourists on the beach in Aveiro were terrified when the plane appeared from darkness and fled incredibly low.
The Portuguese air forces today said that the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast, and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the airplane had flown significantly by the lowest standard due to poor visibility of the smoke of nearby fires, but air forces convinced that no one's safety was at risk.
Land fires have destroyed parts of Manner-Portugal this summer, and four people have died on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese air force today said that the pilot had to fly low visibility due to adverse conditions, smoke caused by fires and a thick fog.
Aeroplane was on a training flight, and as part of the training, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
Exposing the results of the first half of the year, better than expected
The Social and Health Circumstances of Southern Karelia (Exote) made a better result in January-June EUR 3.4 million.
The result was EUR 4.3 million surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional care.
Treatment warranty was carried out in all activities.
This year, the exotte will try to shorten the operational lines.
The exodus covers the surplus of the deficit previously born.
The remaining proportion may be used to shorten lines and purchase measures in patients.
The result of the year as a whole is projected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
For example, the government will discuss the mid-year report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 special border ice-creams swore a military oath in Immola
The 70 officers of the Border and Maritime Guard School swore a military vow on Friday.
The military whales of the Border and Maritime Guard School were held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th special boundary ice cream course was held in the sports field of the equipment.
The Soldier vow swore 70 men.
Special border ice-creams are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They're serving 347 days.
This year, 310 young people were picked up for a special border icehead.
They were invited to the selection tests 250.
Special border icekeepers have been trained in Immola since 2007.
The veteran meeting during the felony was attended by five border forces during the war.
The average age of those with them is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
A lot of burglars ahead... criminal investigations help to solve crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of Finland's 11 police units has operated the RTA, i.e. the Criminal Information and Analysis Unit.
The operation of the unit is outwardly invisible.
A total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlin are present in the häme police department.
That's what you're pulling out of Lahti's position, Sergeant.
He's a Chief of Staff in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian person dedicated to IT in Hämeenlinu.
Everybody's working in a civilian outfit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, sees Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit will produce different reports to the other police.
In a shame, it has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
Reform of the newest working methods
The establishment of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crimes, which means that the police would leave more and more pills in the rings until they get an alarm.
The data collected and analysed by the unit will target daily police activities where it is most needed.
The reform of the police administration involved the establishment of a criminal intelligence centre, its fewer than three national units and its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa is a national director of the activities.
The PTR units work according to their names at the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA units, in turn, work in the areas divided by police agencies and are responsible for providing information to both local police and national units.
Information extends beyond your own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work, the RTA unit is responsible for knowing what is happening throughout the police service.
Information also extends beyond the borders of your institution, because it does so in crime.
People working in the RTA unit have better computer skills in basic police.
The unit seeks to draw the attention of the police to new phenomena, productive criminals or crimes that are similar to each other through registers, alerting mission databases and findings.
This is called a series, and it is one of the most important tools of criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of working.
The handprint is also displayed at work, whether honest or criminal.
On the basis of the way it works, the author is made up of a certain kind of image.
Scheduling can be done either on the basis of an act or a person, depending on which police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not carry their necks up in the city, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by both criminals and criminals are not reported because it could lead to professional criminals developing their activities and thus attempting to prevent police anti-criminal attempts.
The police will report on the methods publicly if they anticipate that they will cause a threat.
Such a case was, for example, a news story of early summer, a way of marking vacant dwellings in housing breaks.
That's where the authors put the apartment on the outside door, the knitting needle, or the tape piece in which they tried to see if the people were really on their way.
Preliminary examination material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The Analytics Unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most clever order a protocol on the right of contenders, which may, for example, show that fingerprints have been found at the site.
Next time, we'll go to the thieves with the gloves.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä from the police of Hämee, Lieutenant Tuomo Lepola from the police of Eastern Finland, Detective Sami Joutjärveä from the police station of Joensuu and Inspector Arto Tuomela from the Central Criminal Police.
The police collect and analyse information to design practical activities.
In the background of the decline in labour and finance levels.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-stage PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
The national cooperation will collect information outside its own institution and Finland's borders.
A schoolgirl from London who was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join Daddy, is reportedly dead in Syria.
Counsel Tasnime Akunjee said that the girl's family heard this death in Syria in Raqqqa a few weeks ago.
On Thursday, ITV News reported that the girl was believed to have been killed in the Russian free attack on Raqqqa, which is the foundation of the organization in the country.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she planned to escape from the tear of the war and return to Britain.
"You can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a gravestone and as a testament to others that the departure to the war zone involves real risks - that it could cause people to give up such a decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other East London schoolgirls flew to Turkey, from which they went on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultana family was told that the girl had been married to the Isis fighter in Syria, and that she became a widow only after a few months.
Reid says Clinton will hold Garland's Supreme Court candidate if he is elected
Mr. Harry Reid, Senate Democrat, says he is convinced that Mr. Hillary Clinton, President of the Democrats, will appoint Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected President.
The Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Mitch McConnell, mayor of the Senate majority, says that the next president will elect the loss of the High Court member to replace Anton Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday at the telephone conference that he predicts "with some degree of certainty" Clinton will choose Garland.
Reidi's representative later said that he hadn't spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would name Garland and that it was speculation.
He said Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "smoke the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the principal judge of the United States Court of Appeal in the District of Columbia.
Reid said that the Republicans who prevent Garland's appointment are the republican presidential candidate for Donald Trump's "bads" and "possibly".
He said Trump didn't fit in.
The Treats says that the descent calendar is "for women as well as for men."
The Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere to publish the 1970s Pirell inspiroima calendar for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they are going to find the next top generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The president of the Treats, Steve Shaw, told us earlier this year that his magazine containing plenty of naked pictures differs from the old school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks that the calendar is for them.
"We must start to present timeless and classical nudity in which women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these pictures of the naked women's body," Shaw said in the press release where the calendar was published.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful art.
Models can leave pictures via the network or personally at open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
The destination of Vinyl: Who actually buys records?
Lone, middle-aged men love vinyls.
Before you start filling up with the irritated insults of the commentary section, whose author is named NoEveryoneMembers of Central Ages, note that this claim is based on real information.
According to YouGov, much talked about the new coming of records is not because more and more people born in this millennium are enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but because of the emotion of the Middle Ages.
Apparently, those who have bought a vinyl disc in the near future are most likely to be 45-54.
In fact, all records are most unlikely to be purchased in the 18-24-year-old age group.
The question is also not just about collecting hobbies, but it includes emotional significance: older buyers of vinyls are slightly more likely to keep their feelings inside (56 % vs 53 %) and enjoy their sole (69 % vs 66 %).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were a TV news report, the camera would follow me when I was walking in the middle of the busy street in Soho, I was wearing a modest gray suit. I'd like to give a hard time before I stop, form a cup of my hands and say something valuable, like, "Let's look at it more closely."
Let's look into it more closely.
At the same time that Soho's attractiveness and dirt are slowly removed - hotels, chain restaurants and shops, as well as office stores now fill buildings with previously independent movements - a handful of amazing specialised disc stores are still left.
For the next part, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment when I stand very close to a number of men in some of these shops while trying to evaluate by observing their age and feeling.
Glasgowlainen Stuart, 55, followed by Sister Ray (a calculator: two young women, three middle-aged men) Reckless Records (a calculator: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in twenty), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and roams shops to spend a few hours.
I'm gonna ask if he's a collector.
"And I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These albums, which are displayed in the picture above (he sent a sample by email, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for obtaining such a huge record and single amount is partly the result of his available income: now he can buy records that he could not afford when they were originally published, and he can buy again those that he sold when he was young and without money.
"A large part of the material I bought is from late '60s and early '70s, records that were published when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to get," he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, and adds: "I don't smoke and drink much.
This is my worst."
25-year-old Wez, who works in Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he encountered fit the profile of YouGov.
However, he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by media enthusiasm. People who have heard that the albums have come back to fashion and who have come to need to buy their old albums back.
On the basis of the discussions I have had, people have usually got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their albums back," he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl reagents of certain ages.
But what about the alleged emotional significance of the records?
In a trade like Phonika, it takes a few seconds to realize that the record stores offer comfort to the same spirits of the community.
According to Wez, some older customers have been injured, particularly in the near payment system.
Some vinyl fans can be shocked from the digital world and choose to trust the durability of familiar disc folders; objects that resurrect the memories of teenage happiness days.
"I think that sometimes it may be about filling the hole or some sort of comfort that owns the objects," Wez says.
As a collector, I myself admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill the thoughts.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker suddenly said from the record pile.
An appreciable ICM opinion poll revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl disc in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The questionnaire also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use, while 7 % of those who buy vinyls do not have a record player.
Here the news report is likely to look very concerned when I browse the pile of bossa nova collections.
This "price" aspect of the awakening is something that Jonny, 42, working in the Sounds of the Universe, has noticed.
"Someone came in a little while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf'," he says.
This is not a large part of it, but this is definitely the case.
More product, less music.
We go to people who say, "I don't have a record player."
So not parents, but younger people, late-aged people who are just getting excited about it.
The Fop, which now has almost a whole floor reserved for vinyls, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Seventy couples, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previous movements, it's great to see the wild beast's most recent sinful and sexual pop, and not improvisation jazz, it's great to see different customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to show the truth by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes looking at various albums on sale.
He's doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He tells me he doesn't make much money, so the record collection isn't really an option.
"It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music either on a computer or something else, but the beauty of vinyl is..." he swells in love.
"I don't know how to explain it's really unique."
My last stop is said to have awakened the generation of new vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
At the same time as I try to look like I'm studying jeanshorts, I noticed a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid cameras for a while before their father and daughter thought about the purchase of Crosley's record player.
On the left there is a staircase with the wall of Adelen, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential discs of any average collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they're just ornaments, and some are so high that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's purely "arts vinyls."
But given the fact that the slightest attention received by these items can mean more money to industry and send a few customers to Soho's cancers to pick up more, there is not much to complain about.
It is not surprising that the most likely part of the population with more time and money is also the one who uses most luxury materials, such as vinyls.
But even though my discovery suggests that the results of YouGov are accurate at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude it from the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in the record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to work hard at school or an office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings waking around Berwick Street's record stores browsing the albums and avoiding a terrifying 30-year-old artificial television shooter watching over the shoulders of unseen middle-aged men in this throat.
Holker is the most far-reaching live spinal animal video report
Researchers say the holker has a longer lifetime than any other planet's spinal cord.
Haita researcher Julius Nielsen says that the record is a female who is believed to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters long.
The French Court rejects the application for the dismantling of trade in the Jungle refugee camp
The French Court has rejected the request by the Calais authorities to discard tens of temporary shops and restaurants from the Jungle camp in which thousands of refugees live.
This week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle 72 temporary trades in which people in the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea with 50 cents (40 cents), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary foods.
The Calais Prefect's Office argued that the sites should be discarded because they represent unpaid co-existence of taxes and because they are a risk of fire and cleanliness.
Humanitarian groups have told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals offered by the state-supported organization and other groups do not provide sufficient food for the increasing number of people in the camp.
They argued that temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free meals to those who need them.
In Lille, the Court ruled that there were no legal grounds for the expulsion of 72 persons involving temporary trades, but said that the concern of Calais's prefect "was completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food shops, cafes and restaurants had a much greater role to play than just feeding people "in extremely uncertain conditions".
He said that the premises offered peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places under demolition was the Jungle Book Kids' Cafe camp, which is unsuccessful and offers 200 meals every day, English and French hours, as well as asylum counselling for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed an appeal to protect children's coffee shops.
The letter sent to Guardian stated that closing the cafeteria "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are only eight years old".
Two charitable organisations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated on Friday that the number of people in Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 people - to the top - since the arrivals rose sharply during the summer.
The price of food falls clearly faster in Finland than in the EU on average
Food is cheaper in Finland to the pleasure of consumers and to the harm of producers.
The price of food has fallen by almost five per cent in Finland in three years, with an average price of 0.9 per cent in EU countries.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become 1% more expensive.
Over the last three years, the price of food has fallen secondly in Finland from the EU countries with the same level of wages as in Finland.
From comparisons only in Britain, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
Information is provided by the Director of Statistics Centre Development, Ilkka Lehtisen, published in the Information & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices that have been related to the overall development of consumer prices.
The latest information is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010th century, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices suffered close to the 1994 price level.
It was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which food has become cheaper a year.
The import bans imposed by Russia on food now weighing the price which have stopped food exports from Finland to Russia.
The supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has therefore increased and agricultural prices have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped Finland's consumer in a short way," Lehtinen says.
The price reduction has also been influenced by the tightened competition between industry and trade.
The large trade chains of the S group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
The consumer's price competition has been seen as a spectacular advertising campaign.
Finland, however, is still not a steward of cheap food, even though the price of food has fallen a lot.
In 2015 food was the fourth most expensive in Finland from EU countries with a level of wages similar to that in Finland.
According to the press, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the controlling countries had the same rate of VAT, they would be sold in Finland from the same level of wages to the third lowest food.
The lehtinen compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven, only Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finnishs.
"If we want to reach the EU level at the price of food, we must have VAT to halve the average level of EU countries and continue the price competition," Lehtinen writes.
The Lehtinen notes that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
It's not like school anymore.
One who returns to the school seat may notice that there has been a change in the school during the summer.
A new educational plan has been drawn up for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all sub-schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan sets out the official objectives.
New guidelines have been prepared for more years and differ from old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of beautiful writing is given up, and instead, schools are starting to practice encoding.
Swedish education begins at the latest in the sixth grade, and societal learning is already being read in four.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before, it was thought that the teacher teaches students, but now everyone must be active and learn from one another.
This is how they try to make schooling more interesting.
The world's longest-lasting spine was found. The ice shark could live for up to 400 years.
The well-known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) will only reach the age of 150.
It may then live another 250 years, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest backbone in the world today.
In the animal community, it only passes by the Icelandic dungeon whose oldest known individual has been timed for 507 years.
Greenland sharks swim all the way to the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
Females stretch over dogs, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Since the growth rate is slow, according to the followers only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified the old 28 females of adult ice sharks who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by the radio-carbon driving of eye lenses.
For at least 272 years, the average age of the investigated sharks was demonstrated.
The two largest fishes in the sample, 493 and 502 centimeters, were exposed to approximately 335 and 392 years of age.
Since previous studies have shown that ice sharks reach relative maturity only more than square meters, researchers calculated that they are about 150 years of age at that stage.
The research published Science.
You're fired from Stockmann for nearly 300. You don't want to cut out salesmen.
Nearly 300 employees are dismissed from Stockmann.
The cooperative companies in the difficulty-driven company ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, some 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will take place as redundancies," Stockmann reports.
It states that the number of dealers in the goods houses will not be reduced so that the customer service will not suffer.
In addition, some 80 employees are offered new jobs as a salesman.
The two negotiations in Stockmann concerned about 3,000 employees.
At the time of their start, the need for reduction was estimated to be about 380 employees.
The reduction of the population is targeting an annual cost saving of around EUR 20 million, to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is the difficulty of Stockmann getting profitable from the merchandise store.
Although the group's adjusted business result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, trade in merchandise is still losing.
According to Stockmann's former CEO, Lauri Veijalainen, sales in the stores have failed to meet the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, personal reductions are necessary to ensure the positive performance of Stockmann Retail in 2018," Veijalainen notes in the newsletter.
The results of the second quarter's improvement were particularly the success of Lindex's clothing chain.
Ketju achieved its turnover and results for the best second quarter of all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased to EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total operating result of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million loss.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover for this year will decrease last year.
The corrected business result is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperature below 20 degrees across the country
The center of low pressure on the north of Finland will keep the weather rainy Friday, says the meteorologist of HS Ilona Láng.
There are also rainbows in the middle of the earth, but the southern is the rainbow.
The temperature is no longer very summerly, because mercury remains below 20 degrees in the entire country.
In the rainy areas of the north, 10-15 degrees remain.
Kenya's general sports team shakes the dopingskandal trick of coaches a strange explanation
Kenyan sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it became apparent that Anzrah appeared on the land team as an athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP said that the athlete that Anzrah tried to perform is a 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a Kenyan group member, reported that the identity of Anzrah was revealed after he had given a sample in the surprise test as Rotich.
Doping officials came to report to the Anzrah authorities.
So I said Anzrah was sent home, for he committed his crimes against the Kenyan land team.
He acted as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such use", said Kip Keino, Chairman of the Kenya Olympic Committee, for your news agency for Reuters.
Olympians' general sports start on Friday, and Rotich is due to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Last year, Rotich was placed in the MM contests on his way to the fourth and has a preview of Rio's winning favourites.
According to Reuters, the source within the Kenyan sports team claimed that Anzrah was only on an accreditation card for free meals in the kite.
When antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to officials because he feared that he would be exposed," the source told.
Where is everybody?
Rio sports stadium rubberizes its vacuum
Where is everybody?
At least not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to follow the sports.
In Rio, a struggle on the medals of general sports began on Friday, but the world's top individuals were able to present their skills to a confusing empty viewhouse.
On Friday, the Rio organizers reported that only 58% of the first day's morning tickets and 65% of the evening tickets have been sold.
The other one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulling out of the cheerful people.
Final tickets have already been sold in Rio.
The olympians in Rio have already attracted attention before general sports.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been displayed in the rugby, melon and horseback watching rooms.
When Brazil's medal masters Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach ball in legendary Copacabana, it was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian twins, the Netherlands played against Russia, and 12,000 people were now full of about 30%.
Badly explained, at least, the fact that Brazil, which is struggling in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians accustomed to football.
Yet even the first match for the Brazilian football team was not filled with football stadiums.
Mario Andrada, an informant of the race organizers, told me that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million endings left to be sold," Andrada said Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million flags of the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets have ranged from about nine euros to more than one thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than EUR 16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio because organizers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, the organizers have given 240 000 tickets to less-known species in a school country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty places in the Rio stadium in the morning.
Even a beach ball in Copacaba sand hasn't been interested in the audience.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in London 2012.
There's enough people in the newspapers.
New way to protect the environment - get the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation will participate in the new ways of natural protection.
The Foundation established last year acquires ecologically important habitats in its own ownership.
Thereafter, private companies and entities may redeem their rights by money to the land.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lap.
The land has been distributed virtually into blocks which the willing may obtain against payment of the right of holder.
The holder shall receive a veto right in 187 square blocks, which in practice means that no approval is required from each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Holder rights can also be acquired for more blocks.
Procuring rule is something concrete that can be left to be inherited or given to be a gift.
You don't have to go carry banderolles or chain yourself somewhere to protect nature," Juha Leviäkangas, a management company, explains.
The person who has acquired the right to rule receives the exact location information of his block, which allows, for example, a visit to the section.
The name of the holders of the rights acquired on the Foundation's website can be found on the same map on which the sections of the land are located.
The leväkanga sees its natural protection procurement as a risk only for the Foundation's activities to change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of general interest aimed at promoting environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the Foundation would somehow act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The fundamental idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is the protection of habitats so that they can be intact and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or as a donation.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of holders' rights, but the Foundation has obtained its initial capital from its founders.
The Foundation's purpose is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the Finnish borders and plans to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trade Center on August 13-19.
The robbers of bikes are abhorring the biggest cities in Turkey - look at the situation in your hometown
Bicycle thieves torment Finland's major cities, the worst of Turkey.
This year, more wheels have been stolen in relation to the population than in nine other major cities.
On the basis of reported cycling thefts to the police, Helsinki Sanomat investigated the number of bicycles stolen in the 10 largest cities in January-August this year and their portions per thousand per capita.
In addition to Turu, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to the police, there were four to five bike thefts per thousand people.
On the other hand, the police in Espoo and Kouvola reported only about two bike thefts per thousand inhabitants.
It's a big difference, isn't it?
"In other cities there are double thefts in relation to the number of residents compared to others," describes the police inspector of the Police Government, Tommi Reen.
The Turku police are wondering why the city is at the point of comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
"The generality of the guarantees can be influenced by how much the city moves on wheels and how much of the wheels are at all," says Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
The Tommi Ree Police Government considers it quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise at the top of the line.
The number of robberies goes largely according to the number of studying and cycling cities.
The Turku has a close center, short distances and lots of wheels available to thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different type of city where city centers are far from each other and the bicycle is not necessarily a priority mover," Reen says.
All over Finland, in January-August, there have been a little fewer bike robberies than in the corresponding period of last year.
Yet there is no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend in recent years, the police will receive little more than 20,000 cycling robberies a year.
It means 50 to 60 fillers each day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 bikes a year.
"They're big amounts," Reen says.
Actually, the thieves are taking more wheels, because only a few of the victims report the robbery to the police.
Reen asks people to make a criminal report on the cycling theft, even if fewer than every ten police officers reported are cleared.
Typical cleared cycling is one where the police will be informed of the robbery immediately and the thief will be caught in his blood.
"The ways are also cleared during other investigations when, for example, stolen spins can be found in the drug case," Reen says.
In Helsinki, bike thieves are caught weekly on their own, or in connection with police investigations, says senior officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, wheels are stolen from, for example, wheelchairs, indoor yards, warehouses and wheelchairs, i.e. practically wherever they are usually stored.
Like the previous years, Jopos, most of the individual bike models are stolen.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of lock.
Some thieves take the bike for their own use, for example, but many of the stolen wheels end up being sold, for example, via the internet.
They stay on the domestic market.
"At least the police have not come to know that stolen wheels would hardly go abroad," Reen says.
According to the police, the buyers of stolen wheels are ordinary Finns.
Some of them probably buy a stolen bike without knowing it.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used bike must be careful, because he may be guilty of a crime or a breach of hiding.
"The alarm rings should ring if a good-looking bike is sold clearly down," Reen says.
Special Library Officer Severi Hirvi carries his colorful Nops during his working day to the protectors of the Kallion Library in Helsinki.
He's had five pieces of wheels, but none of them have been stolen, says Hirvi. "He's never been stolen, he's been a good monk."
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to the thieves, there's not necessarily a hipster value here," says Hirvi of Helsinki.
In the Helsinki Rock kiosk, Siiri Valve quickly locked his bike with a small u-lock.
Now the bike humiliated the kiosk against the wall, but usually Valve locks its bike into some fixed, like a wheelbar.
"There will be a lot of thinking about it, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says the student of Helsinki about his white bike, which alone the helmet paid about five hundred euros.
"Every time you hear from the guys that the wheels have been taken."
"Mostly bad spins, such swamp-jops."
A bike was stolen from the house company's indoor yard a year ago.
The bike, though, had not been locked, so Valve could wait for it.
Less than 15 years of age responsible for their crimes?
Helsinki is testing peer jury members from the United States
In Helsinki, the so-called peer jury is being tried to prevent young people from getting into a criminal cycle.
At first, the experiment applies to children under 15 years of age who now have no criminal liability.
The jury is missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that a peer jury discusses the crime with the offender and sets a sanction.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime may join the peer jury himself to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth Director Tommi Laitio tells me that the model is not tight.
We also have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
"Everyone is directed more responsibly towards young people's activities so that not everything would ruin the first mistake," says Laitio.
A model has been taken from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that after his first crime, the young person does not have to face the adult panel but reflects what happened with about the same age.
The model has been tested once.
The experienced service training agency Palmu serviceformator Iikka Lovio reports that this was an assault that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes of children under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
"It has been a message that you continue on the road you choose," Lovio says.
The versatile jury is part of the Immigrant Young Helsinki project, which is behind the Helsinki City and Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all those needed, not just to immigrants.
More than 70 Republican impresses want the party to stop financing Trump's campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop financing Donald Trump's presidential election campaign.
The U.S. newspaper Politico, which had gotten it to see the draft, newsed the letter.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to Reince Priebus, president of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's money to be directed to Congress instead of Trump's campaign.
"We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disregard, incompetence and récord dissent, threaten to bring a voice belt to these democratic elections," says Politico.
Only directing all potential funds to Congress can prevent Republicans from drowning a Trump-decorated anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult because Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections are falling day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is to be sent over the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons who organized the letter is clearly the Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not in support of anyone.
The letter lists several acts by Donald Trump who are believed to have insulted millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Previously this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they do not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief to U.S. child families
In the United States, President-in-Office of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, explained the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president to make the US economy go well for everyone.
"Donald Trump seeks to be president in order for the economy to go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in his speech.
At the centre of Clinton's plan is a massive $275 billion five-year programme to improve US infrastructure, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by the tax increases of wealthy people, partly by private money.
The construction programme is a hand-help for the American duunars who suffer from the shift of factories to the countries of cheap work.
Clinton called the programme the largest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're the builder people, we have to go back to build!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of working child families.
On Thursday, he also sounded like Sanders, stressing that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a taxpayer, it has to pay a tax on departure, Clinton said.
Today, he is opposed to the free trade agreement in the Pacific, which he previously supported.
"[President] I oppose all trade agreements that work against workers or wages," Clinton promised.
According to speculations published by The Washington Post before Clinton, Clinton was going to criticize the economic programme published by the Republicans Donald Trump on Monday that it "coupled only millions of people like this".
Trump's proposed reduction in corporate taxes Clinton has previously called "Trump's pork hole".
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small businessman himself.
He reminded the listeners of the small-scales whose bills Trump has not paid, and of the clothes Trump himself manufactures in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America big again, he should start by making himself products in America," Clinton snitched.
These are the Rio viewers: Kisats have not glued to Finnish screens, but the mobile app is interesting
Usually, sports races are seen in television viewers' statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
So far, the Rio Olympics have not reached the peaks of viewers.
On one occasion, the races have been glued to the top of the screens at 12 per cent of the population: Tuesday night's swimming was followed by 615 000 viewers from the Upper Olympic Channel TV2 at the same time.
For the sake of comparison: a month ago, the E.M.S. competitions received almost 800 000 viewers at the TV2 level, and the soccer EM competitions were just another million.
For the time being, the Olympics have been most interested in Sunday night cycling and the fifth day of the competition, which both reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel.
The top sports manager, Panu Pokkinen, is pleased with the viewers' numbers, and reminds us that the viewers are first divided into the Rio Olympics for several different instruments.
In addition to television, the Finns follow the Olympic Games in Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the television viewers choose the Olympics as a whole.
Even on the TV side, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports contests to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and there are 20 000 viewers all the time from 500 000 to 500 000, that's a good basis.
The number of viewers is lower than in the 2012 London races or in the 2008 Beijing races, but the difference is explained by the time difference - a large proportion of the Rio races comes at night in Finland.
Another reason for a diminution of interest - if someone thinks it is now a diminution - is surely a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the beginning, the interest would have popped up with it.
In addition, general sports are only beginning, as are other species of interest to Finns: sailing and riding.
The original numbers of viewers have been close to what was expected.
When the general sport starts, the viewers' numbers explode.
The Yle Rio 2016 mobile app, which rose in the first days of the races at Apple's App Store to be the most downloaded free app in Finland.
By Monday, the application had been loaded 150 000 times.
I'd bet we're already going on 200,000 loads.
"We'll only get network viewers later," Pokkinen says.
Rio Areena hasn't worked with all the users, I hope.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
Rio Arena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems at the start of the phase.
Updated versions of the applications should be corrected.
The Rio Olympics will be displayed on Yle's channels and arena more extensively than any other sport ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can follow some species, and on the radio Yle Speech broadcasts games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the most working animals for Yle ever, but also the last ones that can only be followed by Yle's channels.
From 2018 onwards, Olympic sports will be seen both on the High and on commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is your Day, whose depth is 95.3 metres in the Cross.
It may be even deeper.
Technical diving trainer Matti Kannela found a 20 - square - square - foot grasp at the crossroads where the bottom of the diving computer appeared to be 104 meters.
In June 2014, Finland's environmental centre tried to strengthen the observation by relying on the sound.
The method does not necessarily find a small depth of 100 meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So to date, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes include Inari Lake (92 meters) and Suvaswater (90 meters).
More than 80 meters extend to Saimaa, Toissi and the Lake.
They haven't been studied as closely as the Days.
Especially the bottom of the Inari Lake has not been carefully mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela wonders.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
This is how your Day will not reach the ten deepest, and Suvaswater is farther away from the top.
Correction on August 12 at 2:29 p.m.: Last corrected paragraph where the deepest lakes of the middle depth were wrong.
Adventurous tax on pensioners: Taxation on pensioners is still more pressing
The taxation of pensioners is still more pressing than the wage earners.
The admirer says that the misconduct was raised under the parliamentary elections and pensioners' taxation was promised to be equal with the wage earners.
This is not included in the government's presentation.
We believe that it should definitely be.
The promises given should be kept up after the election, he tells the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners received reductions in labour income which reduced taxation.
The matter was warmed up by representatives of the opposition in the Parliament, who had squeezed Alexander Stubbi (Code) on the elections.
Purchase power is secured, it doesn't grow
In the line presented by Mr Petteri Orpo, Minister of Finance, the tax reductions are, according to Ihala, mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not increasing wages, since next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that tax reductions will positively affect purchasing power and employment if other things do not increase people's uncertainty.
The admirer welcomes the desire of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Orpo to respect the competitive agreement that has been made hard.
He says keeping the contract is important for credibility.
This is the most important economic and employment policy action in the period of government.
It has been done with the power of the social partners, so it should not be questioned.
It is necessary because the economy is so much at the expense of domestic demand and people's own future faith.
Infected with prolonged unemployment
The admirer appeals to the government to engage in long-term unemployment, at least to halt its growth.
In June, there were some 17,000 more long-term unemployed than one year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's goal of raising the employment rate will run from 72% to 72%.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, there will be a very large social decline.
Ambassador: No Finnish sacrifices are known in the attacks in Thailand
In Thailand last night and last night, at least four people were killed in bombings in Finland.
The Embassy calls on the Finnish people to be vigilant in Finland and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Finnish tourists who intend to withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the embassy's instructions for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In Thailand, very few Finns
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to assess.
The Finnish Thai travel season is scheduled for the year.
Most Thai tourists come from South Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand through Facebook since the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target, in particular, the Finns in Hua Hin to learn about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are now out of town.
Generally speaking, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
Westphalen says there's no information yet on the attacker.
The ambassador believes that the events may be linked to the political restlessness of the divided society in Thailand and to the constitution of the military constituency of last week's referendum.
The law was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
In the country, among other things, people were arrested who declared their opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, the ethnic national conflict associated with the Muslim population, Westphalen says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big, local holiday in Bangkok today, Westphale says.
He says the Queen's birthday and mother's day are celebrated in the city.
Transportation in the city is very small.
The attacks affect the passage of the day so that the authorities are extremely accurate about safety.
Thai Police: Not International Terrorism · Global Voices
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamist terrorism has also been excluded, reports the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the day after 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as the favourite tourists in Phuket and Hua Hin.
In Finland's popular tourist destination, the holiday in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to the current information, they did not require death sacrifices.
Two bombs exploded in Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was wounded according to the newspaper.
At the popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, there have been four bombs blown up yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both double bombings, at least one died.
In addition, in South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
In both attacks, at least one person died.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, as it is transported by Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The attacker is not known
According to the leader of the Thai military train, Prayut Chan-O-Cha, the attacker is not yet known.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not encourage people to panic any more, he told journalists.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister for Security, Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told the Thai BSB that the authors were meant to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy urges the Finnish people to be vigilant and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
There is no reason for the Thai people to withdraw their journey because of the explosions, but the instructions of the great broadcaster for caution should be followed, Westphalen says.
In wounded Europeans
So far, very little is known about the attacks and their victims that took place during the night of Finland.
Last night's strike in Hua Hin has made it possible to get a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians among the wounded.
At least three people were injured in the last strike of Hua Hin.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the known clock tower.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin from the area where they think they found another bomb.
Sulat Than's bomb, according to the governor of the county, was hidden in a flower bench.
In the attack, a municipal worker died.
There's at least one wounded.
The police chief interviewed by CNN reports that two bombs were also used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded every half hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America's Biles won women's fourfolding
The United States Alexandra Raisman was second in 60.098 and Russian Aliia Mustafina was third in 58.665 points.
Biles, 18 years old, is still in Rio's competitions with the championships on the permanent, jumping and busts.
Biles has been controlling women's gymnastics in a sense of mind over the past few years.
From three previous years, he had eight personal world championships.
He has won the championships of the Qualitation and Permation three times in a row, both in the last and the second years.
In the U.S. team, Biles has won two world championships in the team.
You know, Biles has more MM-medals, and he's got jumps and bushes.
Thai Finnish Entrepreneur: "The strike has no impact on tourism"
The Thai Phuket real estate agency and the children's play club in the same property Esa Huovila is not concerned about the impact of Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, evaluated as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years, Huovila.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen a lot of Thai tragedies.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu and last year a bombing attack in Bangkok.
If these former tourists haven't deported, this is hardly the case.
The office of the hotel is located a few hundred metres from the explosive site.
Huovila heard about the attack from her own employee.
The employee called for about 9 local times and said it's not worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the coastline and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed in the morning because of the attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work in the morning as usual.
They thought that the roadblocks were made for the queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's holiday in Thailand.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 p.m.
On the beach, many people hadn't even heard about the strikes.
In the middle of three days in Thailand, the traffic in Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the scene, the explosion has been pretty small, Huovila said at the scene.
Later, this car was seen in Kruneupy in Jouxholminti.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The patrol detected two men that fit the characters, hiding in the close six.
Another man was caught right away.
One escaped, but later a man was found in the woods with a police dog.
Men are suspected of the use of a motor vehicle, theft, and gross damage.
The police thank those who gave the tips.
Director of Research on Russia's Leadership Changes: Clear Removal
In Russia, on Friday, the highest leadership change took place for years when President Vladimir Putin dismissed Chief Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is an Estonian-faithed 44-year-old Anton Persecution.
He's a former diplomat, and he was a second man of Ivanov.
The fabric burst says that the cause of Ivanov's separation may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from collecting too much power.
He adds that recycling management functions is one way of power.
This is a way to prevent people from accumulating independent power to themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been involved with other managers or screwed up.
Fall of station in Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, is moving to special tasks in the field of environment and transport.
On the footage of the state media, Putin said that he was a joint decision.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution instead, Russia Today said.
The kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view this is a clear fall in position.
Environmental and transport issues in Russia are not very high in order of importance.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russia's power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but he became president of Dmitri Medvedev.
Kangaspuro notes that the old guard, for example governors, has recently been exchanged in Russia.
An older researcher, Katri Pynnöniemi, from the Foreign Political Institute, says that more interesting than the heir of Ivanov's place is that Putin switches to his neighbor's district.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human plate when they retreated in Syria.
They used civilians as a human plate when fleeing to the city of Jarabulus, so that we would not target them, said Sherfan Darwish, who is the representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians had been placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 per cent of the important city of Manbiji for the Fathers last week.
However, it is estimated that tens of Yihadites remained in the city at that time.
Corrected earlier news at 19:30: Previously, we mistakenly told that civilians were fleeing the city, actually the Isis fighters kidnapped civilians when fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of Internal Affairs documentary policy is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior's approach to publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor of Public Law Tomi Voutilainen from the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutian says to STT that the publication of documents cannot be based on the Authority's own guidelines but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior had previously refused to hand over a list of participants from the Minister of the Interior to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister substantiated the decision on the basis of the Council's instructions and the fact that the information was recorded in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounting record.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that the Ministry has noted the need to reform practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic Show starts in Rio
Like the last few years, Bolt's been running against time under the titles.
From the beginning of the season, he was offended by his back path and had to skip Jamaica's Olympics.
This hasn't been a perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well and that's a key issue, Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
This press conference included low-dressed sambatans and fan-made journalists.
Around Porina Bolt underlines that the Jamaican star has risen in the time when the general sport has struggled with the interest of doping scandals and blooming.
The previous defeat of Bolt in the Olympic Games came in Athens 2004, when he was cut off in the early 200 meters of time in 21.05.
At that time, the 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that slowed down your injuries and loose practice.
Four years later, in Beijing, his kingdom began with a hundred meters of destruction of the world record and self - confidence of competitors in spite of the final feast of 9,69.
This is harder.
A year later, in Berlin's MM contests, Bolt reached his career at a time of law.
The world records born in Berlin are still valid at 9.58 and 19.19.
In Rio, Bolt has announced his pursuit of 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds of drops, but no one but Bolt himself believes in its birth.
In 100, Bolt's very challenger is the 100-Olympian of Athens 2004 Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing MM-final, Bolt defeated the American in only one hundred and a half seconds.
Bolt hasn't lost in the final of the prizes since his reign in Beijing, even if he's only made it.
In Daegu 2011 a hundred MM finals left Bolt out of running because of fraud.
Bolt fills in a lot of weeks after 30.
He's an old man in the species of young men, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last goal line for the career, Bolt, has set up next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics who separate me from the others.
I'm older and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in the Sports Illustrated interview.
Exposures from Rio: Two athletes are suspected of a doping crime
According to the Chinese State News Office Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyin doping sample found traces of prohibited substances.
Bulgarian runners and Silvia Danekova are also suspected of a doping crime.
In addition, the Kenyan sports coach was transferred home because he gave a doping sample on behalf of the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
He settled in Rio for the fourth in a woman's 100-metre butterfly bath.
According to Brazil's newspaper Estadao, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case before the CAS International Appeal Court for Sports.
Xinhua reports that the sample given by Xiny on Sunday would have found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other doping suspects have also emerged in Rio.
BBC reported that Bulgarian female steward Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya, for its part, has passed from Rio to the home of a sports coach because of the doping rike.
On Thursday, the International Olympic Committee KOK reported that the Kenyan coach had been performed as an athlete in the test situation and had given a doping sample for this.
According to the media, this is a Kenyan Quick Running Coach John Anzrah.
According to Daily Mail, he had been using a 800-metre runner of Ferguson Rotich.
There's no stopping any phelps. Historical gold came into the showstyle.
The most successful athlete in the Olympic history, Michael Phelps of the United States, swims in the 200-metre mixing of his 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first to reach the same species' Olympics in the fourth consecutive races.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was placed in second mixing before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic Cuisine Commander Helen Skelton is laughing at the evening interview.
The case of Helen Skelton on Monday is most read on the website of this week's evening magazine.
At the address of the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't get much stress if some or the British press has a small hunch of his revealing and special outfits.
TV's a visual media, he's stressing.
Skelton is dressed in high-interest shoes and a short dress with at least enough revealability - at least in the eyes of many conservative British viewers.
However, the back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and the little bouquets are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be shocked, and maybe he's embarrassed, but he's stressing that he doesn't want to be in the lead role.
This isn't about me, he says.
We're here looking at sports, and the focus has to be in sportsmen.
It shouldn't matter how badly I dress.
Can you imagine that the bulb has come all the way to Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers do work and how big sacrifices they do, is okay to me, Skelton's cheering up.
You know what?
It's hard of nothing if it comes from dressing (the runner).
I'm a little fun if this has hit someone's radar.
The police in Rio made two arrests for terrorist suspicion.
On Thursday, the Rio police announced that it has arrested two people for terrorist suspicion.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety of the races.
In the same connection, the police made five other arrests and questioned two persons before their release.

The dam of Argentina smashed the Traitor-Siren, and the Finn was thinking about protest.
Wind Traitor-Siren had a colorful competition day in Rio.
The wind of Sire's traitor had a hard time Thursday.
Argentinian dam sprinkled the Tuuli Traitor-Siren on Thursday in Rio at the opening of the women's surf day.
The winds were clearly broken.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He got stuck because of the crash, and others ran away, said Finland's main coach Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete was thinking about protest for a long time.
Then it was not worth doing because it would have been in vain under the Olympics rules.
I should have dropped into the water so I could have been reimbursed, said the Traitor-Siren.
The Finn was hanging on his plate until the last time, because he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish man was left with the crash on his way to 27.
In the overall situation, the 2012 Olympic optimist in London is the eighth.
As far as the head was concerned, the crash didn't have much to do with it.
Friday is an important day for the race to leave 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, the Traitor-Siren did not protest.
7 special issues that, according to science, extend the age
Science has studied everything possible between earth and heaven.
These things have been proved to bring additional years to the person's life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect the person's health so that his life lasts.
Sometimes things that can't be influenced by a person themselves can bring him further years.
These include, inter alia, a tendency to moderate body fattyness or social status.
Regular shopping may extend the age.
You don't always have to get a bump. Just get a milk can.
The secret of a long age has been sought to find out through many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven of the most strange research results.
According to science, all these things may bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drinks have been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
Harvard University research found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the ‘reduced risk of death', especially with regard to neurological or heart disease.
Once again, on behalf of alcohol, studies suggest that reasonable use of one to three daily doses may prolong life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can prolong the person's life for up to six years, says one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents dysfunctions.
On the other hand, they can promote the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughing affected a person's life.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to be more arrogant after the end of the experiment.
Sex, when the protection from sexual illness is taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also extend the age.
Unfortunately, it's not enough to have sex as a matter of fact.
In order for a person to get more years of his life, he must also get orgasm.
Mobility will bring more years, it will not be denied.
However, achieving a long age does not require absolute loneliness.
One study at the University of Oxford found that women with large butt levels of cholesterol were lower.
There were also more omega 3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study linked these aspects to lower mortality.
It was then an athlete who got to the Olympic medalists or an actor who won Oscar, he's more likely to live longer than the usual bottle.
A lot of research has tried to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life more years.
On the other hand, some researchers doubt that a long age is the result of a person's social status - which, for its part, will allow the pursuit of such confessions as the Nobel Prize for example.
A study on the use of purchases by persons over 65 years of age found that a person who shops daily is likely to be less likely to be a parent who buys.
This is due to a reduction in loneliness in specific trades.
Again, it has been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may lead to early death.
So count the credit card from your hand - online shopping will therefore not have the same effect.
The Umpiman's drunkard fell down on the truck.
On Friday night, in Finland, a serious cholera of trucks and passenger cars took place.
The accident occurred at Koske, mid - Friday at 9:00.
The truck had been driving in Forssa's direction, when the passenger car was driven on the same track, hitting the truck in the right corner.
After the crash, the truck went up, but it burned.
The driver managed to shut down the fire itself.
The passenger car crashed on the road, and then it went over the road to the roof.
A woman born in 1972 who transported a passenger car left her car under pressure.
The rescue facility removed an injured driver from the car and was transported to the University of Turku Central Hospital.
The result of a woman's blow test was 2,02 prom.
He's being suspected of a rude rider.
Post sent candy to the wrong city.
There were shortcomings in the salon K-Citymarket range because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to the Wall River.
Teija Halt, who lives in the parsley, was buying candy from Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday, when a funny sign hit his eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product deficiencies in irradiation because Post delivered our cargo to the Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post is delivered!
So if you don't move in the lawn, then the sign reads.
The zombie sign of the merchant relates to the fact that Post expanded its services last spring to include grass cutting.
The weed cut is on the Post's offer until the end of August.
Haltia thought the sign was mostly fun and she decided to share it in social media.
I was awkwardly beaten by the popularity of the update.
Even media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised by this issue is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, the update of Haltia had more than 700 divisions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in the candy bag, even though a few bars were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the business of transport services, regretted the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
The background is that from five stages three were distracted to the wrong place yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we no longer went to the three sub-transmissions (Saloon), but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
It's the first thing I've heard about tonight.
Laija Halt didn't get indignated by the sign because she found all her own sweet potato favourites in the selection.
Different weight loss! 30 pounds lighter Lotta Backlund published a picture of his change

Backlund's pre- and post-photo pair has collected a number of thankful remarks from the weight losers.
You're great.
At the same time, there's a lot of motivation!
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project now.
I'll get you a lot of power and enthusiasm when you're on the same path of heaven, the other one tells you.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last pounds. Let's do it with the project now.
At that time, he told the evening magazine he wanted to finally get to the normal weight, to which he was traveling ten kilos.
In three months of fitness, five pounds were finally dropped.
Wish of a woman's family in Loviisa: the memory of the victim for police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman murdered in Loviisa hopes that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and adresses by donating for the work of police dogs.
Sipoon Veterinary Station has published a Facebook update that gives the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication reports that the victim had worked at Sipoon's Veterinary Station as a substitute and also performed his nursing practice there.
Veterinary office remembers with words touching a woman.
Happy, smart, humorous and unfearing work.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily for the purchase of security services.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Lovisian woman was murdered in her own homeyard in Loviisa Kosken village.
The woman's neighbors have told the evening magazine that the victim was very much in love with animals.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flower.
A 27-year-old man suspected of murder didn't know a woman and had no connection.
There was a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening situation.
But Börje survived and is recovering.
The Court of First Instance ruled on Post on the infringement of the Equal Opportunity Act
Post did not have the right to arrest the employee who refused to attend the training, evaluated Kanta-Hämee's court of appeal in his judgment.
The Court of First Instance ordered Post to pay the majority of the wages held to the employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, Post could have arrested only a part of the teacher's salary, which corresponds to the share of learning throughout the day's work.
In the light of its trade union activities, an employee had been placed in a more disadvantaged position, contrary to the Equal Opportunity Act.
The Union for Postal and Logistics had been compliant with the decision of the PAU organisation on the prohibition of access to information.
During last year's post office in November, PAU made a decision that Post's employees do not know the rent workers who broke the strike.
First, the news of the people.
Turkey's return to a path respecting human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights development, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (p.) in their response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his earlier letter, the Journalist Union asked Sipilä and Soin to express their concern about the freedom of speech and press in Turkey.
Sipilä and Soini report that Finland repeatedly brought to Turkey the importance of press freedom and freedom of speech.
Putin dismissed the chief of his administration... instead of the Estonian-speaking Persecution.
President Vladimir Putin has dismissed President Sergei Ivanov, Kreml says.
There will be a communist director of the Council and Estonia, Karl Vaino's son-in-law, Anton Persecution.
Persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as Vice-President of the Presidential Administration since 2012.
The persecution will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, reports Interfax News Office.
Vladimir Putin fired the chief of government.
According to the Kremlin Bulletin, Ivanov, a member of Putin's close inner circle, is moving to the specific tasks of environmental and transport matters.
Putin said that Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other tasks and proposed persecution instead, Russia Today says.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union on KGB spying.
Many saw Ivanov as a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed to serve in 2011 before Putin was re-elected as President in 2012.
BBC: ManU's giant purchase for a ban on the game... not to be seen at the opening of the Valioligue.
The world record of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the English Valioligue is kicked out on the weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed in England.
Manchester United's giant procurement Paul Pogba is on the side of the ban when ManU opened his league against Bournemouth on Sunday, BBC said on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid the Italian Society of Pogbasta 105 million euros.
However, the English Football Federation FA keeps him out of the game, because Pogballe remained a burden on Juvena.
He got two warnings last season in the Italian cups, and it's going to become one game ban.
That ban has been transferred to England, FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next league to play is on the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU meets Southampton.
In Flow, great madness is a virtue.
Accurate criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the Flow Festival's position internationally appreciated as an event aimed at the world's top artists.
Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
The festivities have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
One of the main stage artists is Punk-legenda Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is stacked, among other things, by artificial grass and art installations.
We have never had enough to have just a headboard and a beer, says the artistic leader of the event, Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival held in Helsinki this weekend has grown from a small square festival to the event of tens of thousands of visitors.
The background of success is a simple question: What kind of event would the perpetrators themselves want to go to?
Event production is quite abnormal to think this way.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act according to authority orders, says the event's artistic leader Tuomas Kallio.
She knew a week before the event that Flow would be selling out this year too.
The aim has been to raise the number of people in the last 70 000 years to 5 000.
Even this year, the festivals will see a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because things have to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle, which is controlled by huge pathways.
That's what we don't want.
During 13 years, the success of the event has been soaked that 130 exhibits, art installations and numerous restaurants and drink bars are partly made of artificial grass.
In addition to the main layer and smaller stages, 15 000 tents of people are located this year.
The rock admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little crazier, but at the same time we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If it's lost, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for the work done to the rock is that even the great visions today are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, activities in the middle of the 2000s were very dependent on the Helsinki City's approximately EUR 20 000.
Last year, the turnover of the Flow-driven shareholding company was around EUR 6 million.
It allows you to make "grey things" like building that 73 meters wide tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves with their own dress.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about the community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
First of all, we want to distinguish ourselves with content.
However, fashion phenomena also fit in with the value world of Flow: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main stage artists is a punkin legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan of his own kind, but he doesn't have indierock, pop music, rap and soul-combining festivals have the most typical performer.
Kallion says Iggy was bucketed because now is probably the last time this is seen at the show in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good and he's done some damn good jobs in the last few years.
The bombs in Thai tourist paradise were hidden in the flower boxes. The tourists fled in their horrors.
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
Apparently, the bombs were hidden in the flower couch and blown up by cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were blown up at the same time that tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, told the police representative Samoer Yoosumra according to CNN.
From 1989 onwards, the wildlife protector Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, tweeted a much-speaking picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look right, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of those injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
People ran against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened on one of the biggest bar streets, told Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded at Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after that, the Finnishs, too, on Phuket Island, exploded two bombs.
No one knows he's dead.
At the same time, there was another double bomb attack in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
In addition, a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
The police told me that they found at Hua Hin knowingly at least one bomb that hadn't yet had time to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebellious forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, this may also involve criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently been contagious with the activities of criminal organisations involved in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new preparedness forces starts in a war situation first.
In an acute wartime situation, armed men will only be commanded to combat tasks after several months of the oath of the military, says the Middle Finn.
According to Brigadier General Jukka Sonnise, the warfare chief of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, five and a half months of armed men serving at war are only those who are at the end of their training.
According to the Director of Training, the service is first provided for reserves from the preparedness teams.
One shipowner or reserver is not commanded to be assigned to a task that has not been provided with the required training, Sonninen says.
Previously in the summer, the Defence Forces began to train shipowners in immediate capacity units from next year.
If necessary, units may be used in military operations already during training of shipowners.
Pamela Tola got huge compensation from the house.
Actress Pamela Tola and his former husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough fight over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The trade price of a two-story separate house had been EUR 330 000.
After trade, however, there was a serious humidity problem in the house that caused dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132 000, thus accruing economic losses to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple brought the case to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller there.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case both in court and court.
The Court of Justice delivered a judgment on Wednesday.
It retained the judgment of the district court ordering the seller to pay Tola and Warma EUR 150 000 for a price reduction.
In addition, the salesman will have to compensate for the costs of the couple's trial and investigation totalling EUR 47 344.
The right to a reasonable price reduction was slightly due to the fact that some of the needs to repair the apartment had already been known to the buyers at the time of the mortgage sale.
However, the apparent errors in construction were essentially more serious in court than had been stated.
Tola was looking for a good-looking home.
At court, Tola reported that the couple had specifically sought a good house because they did not want to go to repairs.
He was given the impression that the building has been repaired and in good condition and that there is no harm to the aspects mentioned in the fitness review report.
The fitness audit report mentioned as risks and malfunctions in ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting water over the rocky surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it was not apparent that this would have been an urgent matter.
Tola and Waroma remained in the sense that rainfall coming from the rock should perhaps be controlled a bit within a few years.
The transaction was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, wetness problems in the apartment were much more serious than we thought.
The inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 showed that the building was microbial, which the Witnesses said was due both to rainfall and to the rise of the rock.
On the west side, the air contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's estimate, also be reached through the porch indoors.
The health risk-free, limit-bound mould or yacht was found in the hospice samples in the home care room, in the basement staircase, in the living room window box and in the basement washing room.
The terraces were built without permission.
The court also disputed whether the apartment had been extended against the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma were not aware before trading of the decision of the city of Espoo that anti-authorised changes had been made to the dwelling.
Among other things, terraces had been built, although there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were at the heart of the court.
According to court, the buyers were able to assume, on the basis of the information they received from the seller prior to trading, that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measures of repair in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not believe that there was a particular reason to carry out a more comprehensive audit.
The buyers have not failed to comply with their obligation to take a decision, the Court of Justice declares in its judgment.
Scary archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - also in the Finnish register
In a recent article of Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes how documents stored in microfilms in the National Archive in Maryland of the United States, covering a total of 218 500 women who all wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are Germans, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russians.
In addition, at least 65 Danishs, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finnishs and 31 Swedish women wanted to be Nazi bridesmaids.
Documents and registration cards are derived from a breeding agency in Nazi Germany.
The Roots Agency was under the responsibility of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been studied by a SS doctor.
The same applies to even more women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
Andersson said that gynecological studies were conducted for women to find out.
The Race Agency investigated women's history, including by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the female tree.
Women also needed to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial agency handwritten lifetimes and good recommendations from close ones.
The Race Agency wanted guarantees that women were "loving for children", "savings", and "good national Socialists", who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bridesmaids of SS men.
The case does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders set up a state-supported programme known as Lebensborn in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in or outside of marriage.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside the marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, reports from the pages of the U.S. Holocaust Museum.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The government encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The German mother's honorary cross was granted to women who had had at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Areans" and "No-Areans" were prohibited by law, the museum's pages are stated.
On the sixth day of Sire's traitor, Nirko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed third on the first day of Finnjolli's sailing at the Rio Olympics, but the whole crowd remained the top of the sailing at the second day's departure.
In the overall situation, he rose to the eighth after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to the 14th place.
Wind Traitor-Siren fought for RS:X class day leaving places 17 and three.
In the overall situation, the Traitor-Siren is on the sixth.
In 470, Jonas and Niklas Lindgren left the opening day for 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in place of 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded in a couple of hours' sleep, "I was so in the canvas."
Jari Sillanpää has been a member of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship bartender to tangokuninka in 1995, the best sold solo artist in Finland, and the star of dancers and festivals, Sillanpää is still squeezing, and he is currently on the rise.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppisen, was published on Thursday.
The book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in both good and bad.
The Sillanhead's career rose to a real rise in his victory on the Tangokunnian Krono on the Tango River market in 1995.
In the race Sillanhead sang tangoes, but he had already planned a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tango piece to Silanpää, at the request of a man, which Kassu Halone agreed to a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says, however, that the recording of the song did not go exactly according to the plans: Sillanhead sang it on the tape in a terrible crack and only after a couple of hours of nights.
We had a party tonight.
I was so in the canvas!
The bridge head is remembering in the book.
I mean, it's not exactly what I'm saying. It's just that it's been sung in a crack.
Even though I wasn't physically the best, it was still good.
I learnt that all the time you don't have to demand perfect and perfect.
Another coincidence related to the most popular songs of a man, which is reported in the book, took place almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from his then partner and finally ended up with the texts of the Gold Paper, which was published as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the songs ordered by Sara Törmäs were not the ones that Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanhead had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of a separate song were not true, but it was written on the basis of the seven - day news.
In the news of the paper, Jari and the former lover were told that Jari was overly celebrating and drinking, but Jari said it was full of shit and it wasn't true.
Jari called the book in his anger to the record company and refused to sing the song, but finally ended up singing it - and that's good.
In June, the British also surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though the polling week's polls predicted the opposite result.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in favour of the EU's stay.
No valued research institute or university ticketed for the divorce, although a few individual scientists were able to disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western policy, the theme "It's the economy, stupid" of the former US President Bill Clinton in the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voices weren't heard.
They were shocked when the economy didn't seem to be the most important issue of politics.
Economic Kiharaki
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey of the profession, responds to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economists were not listened to because this time the voters made a decision on a non-economic basis.
One explanation for the loss of economic status by economists is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of working people, which is almost standard.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the right British away.
Many also have the view that the fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it contributes to the export industry.
In the view of the Economist, the voters did not believe economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently raised.
They were particularly shocked by the balance of the BBC, which provided only a couple of % of EU economists who were in favour of the disparity than the overwhelming majority.
The EU's angry press was not interested in telling us what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR, LSE and other combinations of economic strengths have to say about the consequences of the differences.
These far-reaching combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the messages of the economists were both listened to and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not think they have common interests.
The academics of major cities such as the Economists would have remained in the EU, but the message in small towns and rural areas did not work.
Migration is also an economy.
The overpowered argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant moves your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafeteria has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center in the waiting room sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British get time for doctors if they weren't?
Every school has children of immigrants.
How much easier would the children of the real British get a school place if they got rid of them?
In every municipality, foreigners live.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists failed to respond to them, and if they did, their responses were not visible.
Economists did not succeed in explaining that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to British public finances and their consumption generates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Reserved in Brexit Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are made by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up the A and B plans.
A few weeks before the vote, a few more weeks before the vote, the victory of the EU-supporting camp, namely, a plan for B, in the event that the result would be a leave, was set aside.
The concern was that investors started pulling their assets out of the market.
The real estate funds normally do not have large liquid funds, but they could now be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When the Brexit took place on the 23rd day, we had 25% of the funds' investments in cash or liquid assets, Vanhanen says of the only open day of Aberdeen's real estate fund that the news touched.
According to the old man, the normal level would be 15-20 per cent.
At that time, the value of the fund was £3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about £20 billion.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all British real estate funds open.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds was 10% or even below.
Thus, the real estate funds reserved Brexit for a very different strategy.
Funds closed trade
When the EU-supported camp won, Europe went messed up.
However, the few weeks following the vote on the real estate market were quite peaceful, says Oldanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech of Mark Carney, Director-General of the Bank of England, where he estimated that Brexit could be a big risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, frozen their commerce.
These together robbed the situation and brought it to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was compared immediately to 2007 and 2008, says Oldanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started spinning, and the fund after it had to close its doors.
Aberdeen's situation was good because of the cash collected, but it also eventually had to freeze its commerce for six days.
According to the old man, they did not actually close the trade, but changed the price downwards.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether the money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down the situation, and most of them canceled the announcement.
Since then it was quite even, and now the market has been very peaceful for a few weeks, says Oldanen.
He points out that, for example, the Aberdeen Manner European Funds have had no similar impact.
There were, however, a lot of questions.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
Old people feel that closures of real estate funds have received an unreasonable amount of attention.
The open funds covered by closures dominate around 4% of British property.
Aberdeen's closure lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may hold its funds to half of 2017.
At present, there is uncertainty and economic growth forecasts have been torn down, but the situation does not look "greater" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future of the British economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought even new opportunities to some of the real estate investors, says Vanhane.
Price and dollar rates are weaker for 30 years, plus 15 % discount sales on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
The Dollar can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of willing buyers, says Oldanen.
Brexit brought mines to the London Real Estate Market
At 2:00 a.m., the situation didn't look so big yet.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, responsible for real estate investments in Aberdee Asset Management, of the British Real Estate Fund, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
There's a strong voice in it.
I realized this is going to the side of Plan B now, old man says in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already fully alive despite the morning.
At the office, television screens normally forbidden to be silent supported the news, and usually the loud people quietly listened completely when Prime Minister David Cameron came in front of the camera to tell about his divorce this morning.
When the market opened, the screen ends just looked red.
It was a morning that he would never have believed to live, says Oldanen.
It is not because, despite the myllerrhea, Aberdeen, one of the UK's largest real estate funds, finished two real estate transactions on the day after the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the option, and that is why the situation was somewhat calm, says Oldanen.
The Brexit vote started the repair shop.
The vote was followed by a storm.
The net collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The market started to anticipate heavy invoices on the British real estate market, and in particular on the London real estate market.
Up to 20% reductions were projected in London's office premises in the coming years.
Soon a group of British real estate funds began to freeze their commerce one after another.
Aberdeen did that for six days, too.
Now the myrrh has fallen, but in the air there's still a bit of uncertainty.
It does not, however, appear to be the last summer holidays this week on the face of the Old One in Helsinki.
He thinks it's still too early to say a lot about what Brexit has to do with it.
So much is still open: how the difference occurs and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the real estate market in London has already been reported first.
CBRE's information on price developments in the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
According to them, all London property prices fell by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City's office buildings, 6.1 per cent of the decrease, Oldanen lists.
The numbers aren't that terrible, but they're monthly changes.
Monthly index was published in 1987, and there have been fewer figures in only five months, says Vanhanen.
All similar drops hit the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It is therefore interesting that Brexit was compared very quickly with the fall of Lehman and the US real estate market to the global economic crisis.
The old man thinks that the parable is not quite a hit, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has now not seen such panic sales as that time, but the willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
You can also find money as usual.
The repair movement could have been ahead anyway.
As a matter of fact, the price-repair movement is not a miracle to him... that could have been in front of him without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of properties in London and other world-class cities have been too high for years.
We've been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Oldanen.
So the fall started really high.
London prices have gone up for four reasons, the old man's list.
The British economy has grown sharply, and the London population has also grown.
The second big trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that globalizes, says Oldanen.
The Middle East and Asia have become new players on the market, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London is known as the city's easy target.
In addition, low interest rates have been feeding, for example, pension companies have been forced to seek profits from new targets.
This loan has been readily available - although, according to Oldase, the debt lever has now been used significantly less than during the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, price rises stabilized last summer, Oldanen says.
Aberdeen also began to lighten his ownership in London, and he was a net salesman last year.
There was some kind of turn to be expected, and now it's here.
What's going on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Oldanen.
He doesn't dare evaluate much, but he says that there's hardly a chance of getting up.
The sensation suggests that there is a downward or steady going ahead.
The old man has already seen more moves up and down because he has been in the real estate sector since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who thinks he's gonna get out of the hole with a job.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, there's too much of a victim.
If you've decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says Oldanen.
The S group begins to register shopping data in more detail than before
Soon the S group knows what you eat, because today the trading group told me that it was starting to collect more accurate information about the purchases of its customers.
Up to now, when the receipt has been collected from the final amount, the group will start to grasp the receipt from the products purchased as well in early May.
The S group is coming after Kesko, because the information on goods purchased by plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to K-Plus Oy's CEO, Ismo Riitala's feedback from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information shall be collected with the consent of the customer and shall be used for marketing authorisation.
The most efficient channel is an e-mail.
A very few customers have banned the use of product data, Riitala says to the Economic Statements.
He said that Kesko would not react to the change in registration of the S group.
Kesko already ranks his parent client in ten groups, according to just food purchases.
Classification is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money used for them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from the K-group's own chains.
Collaborative partners, such as Neste Oil, do not give up their knowledge.
Lidl Finland does not have a stand-up client program and does not have such plans in this section.
Finland's Lähi-Commerce has its own "Ykkösbonus" customer programme, which may be associated with Selection Houses, Siwo and Euromarkets.
At the moment we do not collect information on product or product group levels, we remain at the level of the total receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made and on the day, as well as the customer's receipt.
We have not gone to the level of the K group or the S group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
He believes that the post-Customer programme is to be reformed in the future, but it will be discussed later.
However, Ora does not authorise the registration of product data.
First experiment
So far SOK's customer owner and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address data, basic data have included vocational training, housing, child births and previous personal data.
People in the same economy and their role are also registered.
The purchase of S-Priority cards is deposited with the purchase date and time, place, purchase amount and payment method.
In addition, S-bonus partners have received information from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, the purchase data at product level will start to be deposited in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, the data in the S markets, Prisms, Home Terror and ABC chains are currently recorded at product group level.
For a longer time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be more targeted, says Marjaana Saarikoski, CEO of SOK's customer owner and partner activities.
The S team says they're informing their customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing.
However, data are stored in bags anyway, wanted it or not.
If you want to check your deposited information on the S-group website.
For example, the cashier can't access the information, underlines Saarikoski.
Video: Heila puppy is Custom's newest dog reinforcement - the puppy will become the first explosive dog
The black labrador-outdoor puppy snorts vigorously five similar country boxes at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It won't take long when it sits decisively next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog to play it with his favorite toy.
From the box next to which Heila sat, she was exposed to a jar of flavouring shells.
Rut gas is the first smell that has been practiced with Heila now, says Suntio, the owner of the Heila dog.
Security situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first specialised dog in Tull's search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa airport next year.
The task may also take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports.
However, the airport will be the main job in Heiland because the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks that have taken place in Europe.
The Paris-Brussels strikes caused customs measures and, after the strikes, surveillance has been strengthened, says Mikko Grönberg, Chief Inspector of Customs.
The second is access to training for a gun and explosive dog to the duties of Customs is the posting via Helsinki-Vanta.
As a result of increased internet trade, up to 40 million postal shipments per annum, including weapons and explosives ordered from abroad, can be carried out by the airport.
In recent years, at Helsinki-Vanta airport, the customs office has made some 300 searches for the purchases of online shops, the baggage and air cargo of passenger aircraft, arms parts, ammunition and explosives and their origins.
Heila will work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate registered baggage and mail shipments.
In ports there will be a great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and identify areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
On the basis of the performance of Heila, Customs will assess whether further training of weapons and explosive dogs will be carried out in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
School at the Church Nun
The training of a heila puppy is coordinated by the Tull dog school in the church nume.
Suntio also attends training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the defence forces with expertise in explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smell Heila will be taught to identify.
"Hello will always be further trained as necessary," says Grönberg.
Hila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport are Tull's six narcotics dogs and the money and drug dogs Massi.
The Labrador Beaver Heila has been selected from a 10-dog puppy kid.
The selection criteria for the dog to be selected for the airport include a scrapping and a hunting kit, as well as a calmness because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at home in Suntion, is a close colleague for the customs inspector, but also a family member.
Nowhere without Heila going home, Suntio laughs.
The fine orders go to Heila from a single lake.
The cameraman of the Night-Sayman will lose the camera's mic cover to a fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy to the cover immediately from the "irti" command.
Hard competition for working dogs
I'll finish my initial education next year.
There are further level tests ahead, next October, which will assess whether training is sufficient for the required tasks.
Hilan can see work at Helsinki-Vantaa next year if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, travelers can't come to silencing the workbooks of the dog on, reminds Suntio.
The cost of a single working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, even ten years after which they retire.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work rates last only from ten minutes to two hours.
It's a tough competition in Customs to own working dogs.
The owner of Heila applied for approximately 20-30 Customs employees.
Lucky hit Suntion who hasn't had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties in Customs.
The Mini State received its first Olympic medal. The people get a day off.
The Olympic Gold of less than a million inhabitants in Fiji in Rugby is so highly appreciated in the country that the government has ordered the 22nd of August as a national day off.
According to the country's broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed this after the championship was solved.
The Free Day will be held the next day for the team's return.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fidž rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian tells us that the land was followed by the finals in the capital of Suva, where the stadium was set up with a screen.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game united our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants watched the game, I heard them encourage, said the Fiji Times journalist Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish buyer fainted after a great performance
Milko Tokola, a pressurator, succeeded in his last attempt at 175 pounds after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature.
During or immediately after the heavy lifts, he has fainted many times.
No one has really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola got 175 pounds of push and 145 pounds of trick.
His co-result was 320 pounds.
Tokola tried to get his last push for 175 pounds, as was the case with each other.
In the third attempt, the weights increased as a result of the fierce screaming.
The body trembled under weight until the court approved the lift.
The pleasure of the Finnish buyer was the fact that he has suffered from the problems of his knees.
RoPS got a viral attacker Prosan - Veicker League - Night-Sanomas
The Rovaniemen Palloseura, a man's football team, has concluded a season-long agreement with the official attacker Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a leader in our team with power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovanieme is small.
We went through more than 10 players with an agent through a lot of 50 players from all over the world.
A small crowd began to be separated as a good option for Prosa, the RoPS coach Juha Malinen told us in the press.
Prosa, 25, arrives in RoPS from the Talinnian Flora, where he made 109 matches total 51 goals.
He has also played in the Estonian Land Team.
Prosan is due to be with RoPS on Saturday in the Seinä River where the Rovaniemen will meet the SJK of the master of dominating Finland.
RoPS was needed for the new attacker when the last season's goal King Alexander Kokko moved to Australia.
Threatening Modern Family Star will rise again: Teen Star shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, a nice acquaintance of the modern family comedy series, Alex Dunphyna, is once again bursts by presenting a threat to his body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in minihorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's feet but also this butt.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently drawn attention by changing his style and behavior to a much more courageous one.
The star has possessed images published in social media in very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen to be dressed in very narrow outfits.
Winter, at the threshold of adulthood, has recently also published several pictures of himself celebrating.
If the picture doesn't show, you can look at it here.
Previously this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his publicity image so radically.
In this case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter is undergoing a "typical Hollywood change" from a child star to an adult.
He's been on television almost all his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more it looks to reveal the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer says to Fox News and adds that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen innumerable times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has indignated some of his long-term fans with his image change.
It's not hard to figure out where he'll be in ten years when the lower hill is already so hard, says a woman in Winter's Instagram.
Some of the women's fans instead defend the actress and ask not to care about criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what the others say.
You're an inspiration to many women, you're an inspiring young woman.
Japanese people prefer to be attracted from the Nordic countries to Finland: In autumn it is possible to see a saturated mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract the Japanese to start out of early autumn, Visit Finland reports in the press.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations of Japanese arrondissement tours.
Revonfires are our winter trip cards, and they are strongly linked to the heart tale and the snowy landscapes.
In the winter of the Lapland, there's a lot of demand, but now we're trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
Few people know that the arrondissement starts early in autumn and goes on to a long spring.
In autumn it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the lake's surface reflects the arrondissement by making a vision two times saturated, reports in the newsletter Visit Finland v. Marketing Manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland's main target groups are rich 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city, dreaming of tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey conducted by researchers from the Aalto University and the University of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive picture of the Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need clearer unique attractions from Finland, and Lind said that this revontul has enormous potential.
The nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed over twice as much in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interesting as a target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain will be satisfied with rugbyhope as Fid's Master Course leads to gold
Great Britain's impressive progress in the rugby tournament collapsed to the last challenge Fidz presented in the final Thursday evening when the team experienced 43-7 crushings in the Deodoro stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master's course in handling, bites, fugitives, support games, runs and silk in power when winning gold - their first Olympic medals.
The death came with a reasonable comfort from the silver medal - the third day of Britain - and they were proud of their hard work at the Olympic rugby opening tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Previously on the same day, the hard semi-final 7-5 victory from South Africa could have bothered them in the final.
But in spite of this, Fidi would have won in this condition even if he had a top 15-year-old team.
Great Britain may - but probably not - comfort the fact that at least one British has a gold medal in his neck tomorrow: Fid's main coach is Ben Ryan, the former English boss of Wimbledon.
Great Britain has been quite a trip.
Eight years ago, as Ryan trained, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament.
This is where they lost only one.
This spine hurts, but development is shocking.
Fidi began excellently by combating British attacks for the sake of fun.
Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, this was like they were running towards moving buses, and world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dive in the corner to the goal area.
When it was four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwain's second touchdown on the right side led to a goal drop.
12-0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant coat stopped the men-mountain of Leone Nakarawa from making the third goal, but it was just slow for Fid.
In seven minutes, Jasa Veremalu made a goal in the right corner, and Britain was 17-0 loss.
Nakarawa once again made the goal of a new initiative, and there was still more than a minute left in the clock... the first half of the time.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvoo stumbled through the Great Britain's hits and rushed to the line to make a goal.
After the final kick, the situation at break was 29-0.
It seemed like Fidi was born to play rugby while Britain was just learning the game.
And that's what it really is.
At a break, the UK made coercive changes that blocked Fid's dam... for a total of four minutes, which was well compared to the first half of the time until Josua Tuisova made a goal after Fid's impressive feed game.
Dan Norton captured the Great Britain by making a paint at the left corner of touchdown and reducing the situation to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the islands of the South Sea, whose supporters sang, whipped tickets and danced in viewhouses.
It was hard not to admire Fid's riddled approach.
Mata Viliame's last-minute paint had a bark in Fid's cake that didn't need a bark.
The Pilli was thrown, the Fidians hugged and the Great Britain fell down on the grass, completely beaten.
Previously, on the same day, Fidi had beaten Japan's semi-final 20-5, and Britain won South Africa's tight semi-final, where both made one goal - the British goalball solved the game.
Kyle Brown took South Africa to the leadership in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the area by stunning footwork and made a goal under the paint caps in the second half of the time.
A great late taclaus from Marcus Watson, an English 15-Aside-rugby team from Anthony's brother, secured the victory and finally the silver mill.
The coach's fight against cancer blew Helen Glover and Heather Stanning's back-up victory.
In these races there will be no more emotions of gold, and it really means something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard runs towards history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were ringing on their own, there were three votes in the boat. Coach Robin Williams' echo was present all the time when two contested his second consecutive Olympics in the women's match - the first women in British sports history books that make it possible to achieve this.
Their control was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance unsuccessful, which is also record.
This, what we see, two great athletes connecting on the surface with the smoothness of the bow, does not fully picture the character of the victory.
A group of helpful hand pairs, who gradually promote the things that matter, are behind each revolt. And no pair of hands was as essential as the coach who did not know 30 months ago after a cancer diagnosis knew whether he would live up to this day.
As he said, the situation was sharp.
I had a urinary clot cancer, which is one of the things that could be cut, and they did the surgery.
If they don't cut, it'll spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It changes your way of thinking a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that his treatment was able to begin in early 2014 outside the period when they caused as little disturbance as possible - if that expression can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to heal quickly.
It encouraged me.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department... 20, 30, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
Sobbing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory the first couple thoughts were Williams who had had a nervous morning, and he had spoken a little more commonly trying to deal with his own nervousness.
Stanning, the experienced captain of the regimen of royal artillery command of Afghanistan, said, "I've been an emotional edge this week, which may be a little overreaction, but this means so much to me."
It just stresses how important this is to me, how much me and Helen, and Robin too, have worked.
Three years with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we wouldn't behin', so he's a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have imagined a better intern or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the competition in five years.
The couple set a tough rhythm that their competitors couldn't manage.
Even the last 500 meters when the teams in New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in stock.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen yelled, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important to have control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do anything special.
We didn't look for fireworks today, we're just trying to win a good battle and race, and that's what we did.
Couple of them are waiting for a year before they decide their future.
Glover will attend the wedding next month when he marrys a TV adventurer Steve Backshalli.
Right now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
"I didn't want to say this would be my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on you.
After London, it took about six months to realize that I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
This feels so much better," he said.
Iceland exchanges Panama's leaked government
In October, Iceland will hold premature parliamentary elections, which the protesters who have been ravaged by Panama's information leaks are already demanding in spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed a number of Icelandic politicians evading taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson divorced because of the scandal, but it did not suffice for demonstrators.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
Analysts say it is difficult to predict how much the rage of the people last summer affects the outcome of the autumn election.
In June, the President's elections clearly showed criticism of those in power, and Gudni Johannesson, who was elected as an outsider of politics, was elected.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed Obama was the founder of Father.
The U.S. President's candidate Donald Trump withdrew his latest talks.
He said that he was sarcastic in claiming that the sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization of Isi and the democratic leader of Hillary Clinton.
The Democratic Party was angry about the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
The military chief should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton your tweet.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the popular use of a burkini bathing suit in the bathing areas of the Muslims, among other things, says the Britishtile Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for all who do not have a good manner and a swimwear that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimwear, which greatly expresses religious ties, can increase the risk of disturbances in France, which has been subjected to terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove into a crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two extremist organizations of men connected to the Father attacked the church in Northern France and killed a priest over 80 years of age.
The quality of the bathing water in the Oulu region passed through the siege - Pykkösjärvi
Water samples taken from the official bathing areas of the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only blue sealing has been detected on the Pyykösjärvi beach.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in the region of Oulu took water samples from the nine EU coasts in the region of Oulu and from 30 other public bathing areas.
With the exception of the seaside of all bathing areas, the concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria were below the limits laid down by the Ministry of Social and Health regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococci in the seaweed bathing area were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had fallen below the operating limits.
The blue swam detected on the lake's bathing area does not yet make the water unsuitable, but under favourable circumstances the situation may quickly become blue-swam flowers, making the surface of the water a blue-swam mass in layers.
The environmental action will be monitored by dense checks.
If the blue flavour becomes a blue flavour, it will also be reported separately on the bathing area notification table.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
MTK's Hakkarainen forest gift reduction: More than 80 % of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the budget proposal of the Ministry of Finance next year.
The Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of a generation exchange of gift tax.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for a reduction in forest gifts has four objectives: to promote generational exchanges of forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forestry and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the net income of the forestry.
Over and above, the idea of making such a tool to promote the exchange of generations of forests is good, commented on by Juha Hakkarainen, Director of the Central Forestry Union (MTK) of Agriculture and Forestry Producers.
However, Hakkarainen finds a critical tax change proposal.
The reduction of forest gifts is proposed for the pure capital income of the forest owner.
It is capital income from which all other deductions have been deducted.
MTK and Hakkarainen considered that the effectiveness of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could result directly from the sale of wood.
The VM proposal is based on a reduction in the net capital income of the forestry to prevent a loss of the income of the forestry from being deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would have a tax advantage even if he didn't sell wood.
The calculation model is innecessarily complicated.
The average hunter owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he says that the model applies to only a small part of the forest owners.
The tax reduction limit for forest yield is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled too high in Hakkarainen's mind.
As such, he said it would cut off 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction circuit.
The mall would have an impact on about 10% of the forestry company, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of farming.
In forest policy, the forest reduction has been taken for decades by Hakkarainen.
Its background is the ageing of the forest ownership.
According to MTK, the average age of forest owners is now over 60 years and about half of forest owners are retired.
A strong raven surprised the car drivers in Himanga... two cars crashed into the track and ran into each other.
There was a special after-job in Himang on Friday morning.
According to the rescue agency, two consecutive cars fell into the dock, after which the back of the car hit the dock ahead of the time.
According to Harri Pyyhti, the day-to-day firemaster is suspected to have been caused by a strong raging deafness.
In the back of the car there were two people who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more information about their injuries.
The driver of the car didn't get hurt before the time.
The accident occurred on highway 8 from Himang a few kilometers to the Kala River.
Finnish study can help improve the effectiveness of cancer therapy
Recent research results from Turku University researchers can help to develop cancer treatments more efficiently.
The findings made by the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska study group show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the quality of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth was prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the cancer-round tissue to correspond to normal soft tissue.
The effectiveness of cancer therapy in the future may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells in addition to cancer cells and surrounding tissue.
The results of the studies have been published on 4 August in the prestigious Nature Communications magazine in the field of cell biology.
Muhos family murder continues in court, the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another perpetrator
In the case of both convicted persons, the wooding of the family home killing continues in court.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for a family home in Moscow.
One received 8 years of four months, including as a young person, of killing and gross robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder and gross robbery committed as a young person.
The person convicted of the death was also sentenced to threaten the safety of traffic as a young person and to transport the vehicle without rights as a young person.
The prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe sentence were complained of the verdict.
The prosecutor calls for a lesser punishment of a man sentenced for murder as a young person to 12 years' imprisonment.
They were in a perfect understanding at the time of the act.
According to law, 17 - year - old youths killed a school home as the director of a child protection unit in July last year.
The 17-year-old man who was sentenced to murder, according to the reasoning, attacked a pilot sitting in the living room on the couch.
The guide had gotten out of his grip and put a young man in his room, when one of the young ones hit him with a vacuum pipe.
The driver was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among others.
According to a mental study, both convicted persons were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from a family home at least from the day before.
Ice shark is the longest spinal cord of the world, growing only at the age of 156
The longest alive spine in the world has been secured by the ice shark, reports a study published in the Science magazine.
In the north of the Atlantic, such as the ice shark that swims around Greenland, i.e. the hollow can live up to 400 years of age.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
Ice shark's life is added to the fact that it grows only a centimeter a year.
Only one mollusc species is known to live longer than ice sharks.
The researchers found out the age on a radio coal drive.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on them, scientists were able to assess the age of sharks.
For the age of the elder, it was estimated that 392 years, although throwing in the direction of the elder could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as Economic Wise - The News of the People
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all tax revenues from the state would not be received if Donald Trump's change in corporate tax was made.
Tax revenues would also be reduced in particular through the most profitable tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax programme as a revolutionary when he presented it in Detroit on Monday.
Business tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
There would be a huge amount to be missed, $1 billion a year.
The high rate of income tax is now 39.6 after Trump's reduction 33.
They'd give up the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the state of overregulation in business and of driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The final environmental standards of the scaffolds must be renewed and the regulation of the energy sector must be discarded.
The reform of Barack Obama's health care needs to be retrieved.
The administration must be appointed as "experts instead of bureaucrats".
"Destructive" trade policy is, according to Trump, the main reasons for the problems of the United States.
The free trade agreements would be dismissed.
Imports from the PRC would be subject to a 45% penalty tax and 35% penalty tax from Mexico.
We're offering a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our confession, Trump declared.
Donald Trump's America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes to unite cities, American ships to oversee seas, American steel to raise new clouds across the country.
In spite of its objective, Trump faithfully read through the speech written by the assistants, even though well organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
The economists - also those close to the Republicans - see Trump's program taking the United States to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton published his own program early on Friday in Finland.
A wave of raids from the past - The News of the People
The sea mills fatally, but the real wave of attack hits in the middle of the streets of Madrid - the accounting with the past can begin.
It summarized the core of Pedro Almodóvar's new story.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Matkarakastajat (2013) was a small fun and rustic satirian comedy, the predecessive skin in which I live (2011) the top of the Spanish tutorial career.
At the same time, Julie (2016) is placed somewhere between those two works.
It's a reconciled, semi-sexual love, human relationship, and family drama, the center of which is the relationship between mother and daughter.
It's a simple story, and we'll see it a lot long backwards.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
In the aftermath of a random encounter, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) must be marvelous all the way to the end of the film.
In the form of a guarantee and a long letter, Juliet repeated the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He begins from the time before the daughter's birth, from the times when he met this coming father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta as a young teacher, Adraina Ugarte, a TV-tweet from the Ommelte series (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be regarded as a thorn, but I would say that it is rather sleek and wordly with a single wipe.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance between such a distinctive glimpse of ability and humour in Julieta.
It is equally played, restrained, a place that contains good music and a rather sad film with such materials in its elegance.
On the other hand, the typical visual colouring capacity for the Spanish guide is stored and so that it begins to inject a little quietly into the eye more as a pure form than as a functioning dramatic means of efficiency.
Diseases, deaths, or only sudden loss of the film, are the subject of the film, but the surface remains as korean.
This applies in particular to dressing: in the case of a name person, you live from scene to scene, and the same applies to the earrings shown.
Almodóvar is accurate in these matters, but the main issue, that is, the signs of the seizure, is not particularly improving.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has made a manuscript based on three novels awarded by the Canadian Alice Munro in Nobel 2013.
The Novels have been published in the book "Farkulainen: Reports".
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly even written literature filming.
There would have been emotionally unreasonable material for more vigorous drama, its large amount of things - especially the blazing guilt - theme of the movie.
Guidance and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
It's based on Alice Munro's three novels.
Main: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8.
The government tries to win elections - The News of the People
No new surgery will be done, saying ministers, so that the basic Finns will not be completely collapsed.
However, the cuts decided in the spring will be carried out in the shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The already decided savings of four billion will suffice.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Finance Minister Petteri Orpo (Code) under the budget line.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal because the cuts in social security were already decided on in the spring framework.
Children's allowances, pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index are cut by 0.85%.
The duration of the benefits-related unemployment insurance will be reduced from 500 to 400.
Training operations continue.
♪ The kings haunt ♪
Why do ministers stress so hard that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
Municipalities will be held in April and are the most important fever meter in the election season, not the gallups.
Even before, it has been seen that the municipal outcome of government parties in different directions will ruin the government's mood for a long time.
However, the gallops tell us that the government party of Finland expects a slack leap, although the result of its previous elections was modest compared to the parliamentary elections of 12.3 per cent.
The fundamental Finns received 752 new councillors four years ago, most of whom will be paid the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life line of the government of three or so great parties is in the hands of the basic Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters of the parties have had enough government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's group's presence have also come to the surface.
First of all, the new surgeries will not come, and the fact that next year they will be done hard and secondly, they will try to soften up the fundamental Finnish strike.
Big surgeries in 2018?
After a year, everything will probably be different - if the Sipilä government is still up.
The government has set the goal of debiting over this parliamentary period, but next year's budget proposal for Petter Orpo will be indebted to EUR 5.9 billion, which is more than this year.
After the municipalities, the government has two options.
The first is to raise the hands up in the middle of the parliamentary term and admit that the government is unable to comply with its own programme: debt is not broken down or even slowed down.
The other one is to hold on to the program.
This means further further cuts on the previous ones in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would at least be built close to balance during 2018 and then in the spring it will be accepted in the parliamentary elections.
The indebtedness of these activities
It is quite clear that in the current actions the debt will not fall, although Juha Sipilä is trying to stimulate a positive mood.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäen in the consciousness of the budget prove it inadvertently:
World economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. appeal from the international economy will not become.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except during the recovery policy that took place at the beginning of the 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35% in this decade and has been extended by an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now pays EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current general government debt, which exceeded the 60 % threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 % in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt recovery of the Left Union was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will be covered in practice entirely by taking up a new debt.
This is the idea of the centre, the assembly and the fundamental Finns of what is responsible.
Question: The Municipality Wants to Leave a Lot of Missions
Three out of four believes that the organization of day care for children, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, is reflected in the research of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people are also responsible for libraries, culture, citizenship, building supervision, high school education and waste management.
On the other hand, the responsibility of the province is more clearly sought by rural development, specialised health care, vocational education, vocational universities and institutional care for the disabled.
There is no wish to transfer any of the tasks under municipal responsibility to the State.
A low-age rider was running after-drive to get the police out of here.
Joensuu, a 16-year-old biker, drove a police squad away in Joensuu in Ilomansuu on Friday night at half a time.

Still after this, a young man ran away, but a quicker-foot policeman ran into a runner.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 proms.
Nor did he have a driver's license that would have justified driving on a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to traffic safety.
A truck in stone fell into a ditch
The truck in the stone fell down on the knee lake at 9:15 p.m. in Kaavinti on Thursday night.
The truck was driven to the left in a bustling bark out of the road and crashed on its side.

The ingredients of great inaccuracy in the air... see the parafiscal gallery of the parafiscal destruction.
The crash flow of parafest tents caused massive destruction.
The president of the Joensuun Parafest Association Arto Pippuri estimates that the festival will reach its economical feet and that the event will also be organised next year.
The last actress of the Parafest, Kalle Salone, appeared at the end of Friday night on the Thursday stage.
On Saturday, the program will continue with shows held at the city theatre premises starting at 13:00.
The Art Center in Ahjo is a Parafest Exhibition at 13-15.
The programme is planned.
The crash flow occurs on the cloud when the rainwater and its weight starts the dropping air flow.
Changes in the shape of the cloud water bind the heat, and therefore the lower air mass cools and its speed towards the earth is accelerating.
The Institute of Air Science reports that there are several flows in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the route of crash flows.
The crash flow hit the backyard of the Joensuu art museum at Parafest's event site on Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents fell down, and there were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four persons were mildly injured.
There was a child in the crowd, who was slightly injured in further care.
Air pollution ages in London
According to the study, London's skin grows faster than usual.
The cause of the ageing of the skin is air pollution.
Evening Standard is a report of the British investigation.
British skin care company Caci analyzes London's most toxic particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retired Londoners is two and a half years older than the elderly in rural areas.
Small particles that olden the skin are a very fine dust pollution that comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory disorders, which, according to Evening Standard, almost 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to pass the outermost layer of the skin.
Caci's study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for the Londons who travel on their way to work in the vicinity of congestion streets.
People in London may try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleansing.

Josban, Kataja and the Rivers to the U.S. Country Team
Anne Jumppanen has played almost every salibandy MM race since 2003.
Now in Tampere, there are already six races, only 2013 was missed after Canada was better in North American carnivals.
I was working in Turku and playing there with women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a gymnastics team.
I was interested, and here we are now, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City of Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 Jumppanen went to Joensuu University to study data processing.
When I came to Joensuu, that kind of thing wasn't played at SM level yet, just like a salibandy.
The radio was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in the River Boys hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played the SM series for the period 1991-92 with the university, the following three runs went by in Josba.
Besides playing, he trained the A girls for the championship.
Women's SM series career culminated in silver 1995.
All Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, the balance accumulated in 169 matches 51+34=85.

Beach Volley artist Essi Hasun circle closes to Kouvola - SM gold is missing in the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
Beach volley's Finnish Championships will be decided on the weekend in Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, measurements are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airballers and the Finnish Airball Union, the SM Final Tournament will qualify for the six best pairs in each series.
Local color in the tournament is represented by Elimäen NMKY's breeder Essi Hasu, who has belonged to the Finnish beach volley peaks for several years.
Nowadays, Hasu in Helsinki is looking forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many people as possible get to the viewing room this weekend.
I'm sure the Pesisstadion's going to be a great arena.
I haven't played very often in the adult series in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finest home corners, Hasu tunnelmoi.
The Kouvola region lit the Hasu spark for sport and gave good food for a great hobby.
There's a lot of memories in the minds of the child.
When I was 9 years old, I started a balloon at Elimäen NMKY's E-girls.
The main one is in mind too big a game shirt, knee shields spinning ankles, as well as splendid ass screams and choreographies after point, Hasu remembers.
In a small town, there was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The group's shared spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All the families were in a strong way with the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the president of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural variety choice in junior time to counterweight indoor balloon.
There's been a party on the curve lamp beach since the 1990s.
The operation on the stand has always been active.
I also went to the junior SM tour myself, thinking that one day I'd be there playing.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays in the weekend together with the little Anniina Parkkie in the SM-finals.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, the goal of the second ranked two in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM gold in the prize cabinet, Hasu throws mysteriously.
The weekend in Kouvola may be the last of Hasu in front of a familiar audience.
In early September, new challenges are awaiting civil work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallion tournament.
Otherwise, the toes are put on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly left as a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurship means risk intakes, sweat and energies.
A young farmer, Solomon Koli, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future in the countryside as well.
Koli soon started two years ago, together with his little brother Valtter Koli, as a continuation of their home space.
Their father Markus Koli helps and counsels brothers with his own experience.
Beginning as a rural entrepreneur meant a debt and an increase in order to allow bread to come into hand with agriculture.
This has been my case since the little boy.
I've always been happy to work on the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur myself, I've put everything in the game.
If something starts, I think it needs to be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a yard tower, and at first the bank was not excited about it either.
However, I was very courageous to participate in the project and have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli says and adds that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything is still going to be good.
The goal of Salomon Kol, which is growing meat cars, is to invest in an even larger ship.
The work has produced results because Solomon Koli has been selected as the top ten in the competition of a young food producer in the Rural Future magazine.
At best, he's competing for a possible victory.
He can be voted on the newspaper's website until 21 August.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest reading for years (after June 2012) and the first reading above zero after October last year, when positive 0.2 % was reported.
The average annual inflation measured by the cost of living index in the last 12 months was -0.8% (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to 12 months before it (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101.0 per cent compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0 per cent.
From the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) the inflation rate has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 was -0.2% compared to July 2015.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in the price of the following consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, economic supplies and routine maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat's "anime" power is criticised as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, anime has acted as a source of inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it is racist.
With its lens tool, Snapchat enables approximately 150 million users every day to edit reality and play identity in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character that would suit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are simple, face-shaped tools that produce more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All misleading steps will quickly end up in public documents.
Snapchat's lenses have previously been criticised by accusations that the application advertises blackface or "black face" mask or prefers whited skin color as a beauty taste.
So when Snapchat this week advertised some users of the lenses that gave them blunt eyes, teeth and cheeks, some critics called it a racist karikaty of Asian people - "yellow" or yellowface.
And they wondered if these repeated polemics could be a sign of the company's greater problem with regard to diversity.
The news and resentment spread to a wide range on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, the day later Snapchat said that he had abolished the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was meant to be honored to anime characters, not to be a cartoonist of Asians.
But for experienced observers of racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others strongly denied anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely shared in photographs, said in his email that the lens was "at least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that "it is difficult to argue against a comparison that is next to an extreme Asian cartoon and filter efficiency".
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow face, but a yellow face taken to extreme despicability.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be tied to the endless struggle for diversity and participation, from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the equipment that we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge, racially diverse audience of young people may mean that they are even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates a user-infringing image, "it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed before."
Thursday Zhu, product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to remove his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In his writing to Medium and telephone interview, he said he believed that racial disputes reflected the lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's mainly white male leadership and decided to write with #DeleteSnapchat (#DeleteSnapchat)
"Whether they do not have a diverse representation of different skin colours in their staff, which is why they are able to make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have different skin colour representatives working, but they are not in positions where they feel safe or could speak directly."
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint to which Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its staff, noting its status as a private company.
Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss his staff's races, but according to the representative, some time ago the company hired the recruiter to concentrate on under-represented populations and to take forward internal integration efforts.
For its part, Zhu said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay."
According to the Congress Panel, military officials distorted Isis intelligence.
In a report published on Thursday, the Congress panel stated that the US military headquarters of the authorities, which edited intelligence reports, were more optimistic about the war against Fathers in Iraq and Syria than what events on the ground justified.
In the part-year report of the Representative's Committee on Defence, the President of the Republican Committee, the Inquiry Committee and the Sub-Committee on Defence, there was "disseminated dissatisfaction" among the chief intelligence analysts, who said that the managers played a role in their assessment of the efforts of the Americans to win Isis.
The headquarters, known as Centcom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which supervises US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The outputs of intelligence approved by the senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of the U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than the facts on the ground, which were more positive than the analyses produced by the other authors of the intelligence community," the press release of the report said.
"The events of Centcom are unacceptable - our fighters in the war suffer when bad analyses are presented to high-ranking decision-makers," said the representative Ken Calvert, Republican of California.
The failures of Centcom's leadership will reach the top of the organisation.
The 10-page report describes in detail the constant problems in the descriptions and analyses of US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although it does not provide clear evidence that the high-value administrative authorities of the Obama regime have ordered reports to be manipulated, it describes the acquaintance of the analysts, as if the Centcom leaders had put pressure on them to describe the threat of the Islamic State, Issis, in a more positive light.
"For the first half of the year 2015, many press releases, opinions and certificates for Congress were much more positive than the events themselves," the report said.
For example, the Centcom Authority publicly stated that a major attack to reinstate Mosul could begin even as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still in custody of Daddy.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear," said the representative Mike Pompeo, the Republican of Kansas.
From mid-2015 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders of the U.S. military headquarters manipulated the intelligence outputs of the U.S. military force to reduce the threat of Iss in Iraq.
The Republicans created, after hearing the working group, that the analysts had raised concerns about the manipulation of intelligence data from the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be followed by more extensive results when the investigation is under way.
The Overinspector of the Ministry of Defence has initiated an additional ongoing investigation into Centcom's investigation.
On Thursday, representatives of the House of Representatives' Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which were consistent with some of the final conclusions of the Republican Working Group.
"From 2014 to 2015, Centcom created an inextricably isolated process for the intelligence assessment of the security forces in Iraq," said Mr. Adam B. Schiff, the leader of the Committee's democrat, in the opinion.
According to Schiff, this process "speaked the publication of intelligence outputs", weakened the mood among analysts and "differently provided sufficient space".
Schiff and the Democrats said that they did not find evidence that the White House would have tried to put pressure on Centcom's analysts to agree on their conclusion to "the previous or political story".
The Daily Beast reports on the preliminary results of the Congress investigation on Tuesday.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon Overinspector has initiated an investigation after the Centcom analysts' complaints.
Commander Patrick Evans, representative of the Pentagon, said in his statement that the Ministry of Defence did not comment on the report of Congress as long as the overinspector's investigation is under way.
But he said that "experts disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these essential issues of national security".
The investigation has other consequences, except for the question of whether the bombing operations led by the United States in Iraq and Syria have been successful (such as an increasing number of defence authorities are now claiming).
Last year's allegations questioned how much President Obama can rely on the leadership to act honestly to assess the military operations of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis targets.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects more than a decade ago a dispute when Centcom's intelligence analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research article saying that despite the objections of several analysts, President George W. Bush's administration supported a small army in Iraq and spent very little time thinking about the consequences of the 2003 attack.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion regarding the intelligence of the Islamic State.
According to the authorities last year, the Hooker Group concluded that despite the opposite public opinions, express attacks against the refineries dominated by the Islamic State had not significantly undermined the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary refineries to sell oil through the black market.
In September, The Times reported that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The centcom bridge commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators considered his testimony to the Senate as an over-positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins fourth consecutively in women's land hockey, organizing an interview with Britain
The day after he had made three goals of the team when winning Japan 6-1, Katie Bam made on Thursday for the US women's land hockey team two first goals of the Americans when winning India 3-0.
Five goals in two games sound like an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam said he wasn't sure if he had done the same before.
"I have no idea," he said.
"I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a book of his paintings."
But this he knows: the Americans are in the 4-0 Olympic tournament and they share their group's first place with Britain, which was still untapped after winning on Thursday in Japan 2-0.
On Saturday, Britain and the United States will meet in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have survived the quarters, and this game will determine who will be the first and who will be the second in their six teams.
First, avoiding a strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, a slightly longer quarterly finals.
Whatever the Saturday game ends, the Americans have aroused cough with surprising success here, four years after they stayed in the London Olympics for the last 12 teams.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in the Blue Bell of Pennsylvania and picked up a land hockey bat at the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played species in Drexel), joining the country team at the age of 16, when he became the youngest player of all time.
He wasn't involved in the 2008 Olympics because he didn't get into the final playlist.
In 2012, nothing worked for him and his teammates.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed coach, and things began to change.
"Culture change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the same work rate in London as we do now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half-time painting at a rally near the goal.
India had come to the game with one win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly hard and kept the situation at 1-0 reading until the end of the third round, when Bam took over.
He carried the ball for a long time on the left side of the field, then circled in the middle and slid the ball into the goal, taking the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the middle of the fourth round.
This zero game was the first U.S. goalkeeper to Jackie Briggs, who had left one goal in each of the first three wins.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
"We now have a good situation," Parnham said, but its goodness depends on the outcome of the game on Saturday.
Trampoline peace in the middle of the Olympics
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are running.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be a constant and inevitable, rageous message of competition and effort.
It's as if the olympic itself should be a flaming message cape, which is transmitted from the bow boot to the swimmer and the gymnastics to the triathlonist.
It is impossible to turn on television, read the newspaper or listen to the conversation of the converter in the line of the cafeteria without hearing about the anger between Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then it's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympics and a future heartbreaker with a smile hole, could well be one of the names known to all who are presented at the best time and who support sponsoring agreements and good-minded TV ads - if he was a swimmer, a gymnasticist or even a swordwriter.
But Dooley, from Lake Forest of California, 28, competes for Olympic Gold in trampoline.
The olympialie does not enlighten all species as much.
Farther from the middle, partly in the shadow, are the species that are generally not accepted by all: air pistol fire, bow fire, football, taekwondo.
We always have a breastfight. Long live.
But if I can make a moderate number of my special favourites, I would like to draw attention to the limited charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic species since 2000, when it made its first appearance in Sydney's competitions, its presence in the past 16 years has been so limited that many of the interviewers did not realize it was an Olympic species at all.
This may be regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the species, it has never won a medal, and its athlete has not advanced until the end of 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share men, Chinese and Canadian women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan defend their gold medals in London.
Trampoline, however, is associated with a certain type of attraction, partly because of the uncivilized ear it sounds more appropriate for a clown school than for the Olympics.
Here I have to confess that I'm not an expert, I'm just a volatile fan.
There are opportunities for fun in this species, as we can see from the color of the endless sketch films, but it also has the sweetness of the exercise and swimming jump, two species that are basically united in it.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampoline", which means the ponnander.
The championship pursuers jumped with a giant trampoline up to almost 30 feet high, and they must perform sparkling business series (translations, skills and volcanoes) and eventually land on their feet.
According to the official Olympics programme, they will be evaluated on the basis of implementation, difficulty and "airtime".
There are 32 athletes in Rio from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The direction of the most common Olympics is straight ahead.
Those who hope for the dimensions must go to the gold in search of it further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the goals, sometimes back and forth around the field.
They are not only hunting the paint line or the beginning wall, but also, in television news, another irrigating border: world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, and even fanatic, and it can even get the viewer to tears.
But that's also why even looking at the races can be a little exhausting.
Trampoline offers you a moment of rest here.
Trampoline's direction is up.
The aim is not to move forward.
The competitor rises to the new rise, seemingly unweighted as an astronaut, goes up, then down, then uncomfortablely up again.
Of course, there is no lack of competition or difficulty, but during the programme there is no rage toward the end, no jumps to the distance, just a sleepy, melting interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to the zen space as the Olympics can get.
Women's carnival competitions and then the finals will be held on Friday afternoon at 13 (ET), and the men's races will also come on Saturday at 13:00.
NBC sends the finals as part of its afternoon software from 14:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic drug they offer a quiet, attractive moment, which is most likely not noticed in general chaos.
And if awareness is achieved only by offering men's athletes to be stared and objectified (such as the U.S. men's forces some time ago proposed according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for a swelling new fanship.
"The generation shows its mind" in Ethiopia, which is a long-term US ally
Violent Demonstrations in Ethiopia
The protesters calling for political change in Ethiopia have faced a violent opposition by the government.
The witnesses say that dozens of demonstrators have been shot to death in a confrontation with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking?
Over the last decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable states, a strong Western allied whose economy grows rapidly.
In recent months, however, protests against the government have shaken the country by spreading to more and more regions.
Just last week, thousands of people roamed into the streets demanding a radical political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's response was pathetic.
The witnesses said the cops shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos recorded in the demonstrations, which are believed to be late last year or early this year, show how the security authorities beat young people with a stick while they were forced to stand against the wall.
The United Nations Primary Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"Keeping this country together was always difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future," said Rashid Abdi, who is the Head of Project in the Horn of Africa in the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa since Nigeria, and the Western countries appreciate its stability.
America's military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians in the fight against the terrorist threats of the region, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives so much assistance from Western countries.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved extremely much, and the capital of Addis Ababa is even a new train for travellers.
The streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, the human rights organizations have been constantly talking about the oppression of the government, the country's opposition has been limited and the dissenters have been silenced effectively.
Many have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the desert.
But this may be changing.
"If you suppress people, and they have no choice but to show their minds, this will happen," said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth is showing their minds.
One generation shows their minds.
Complaints are diverse and cover all the power of the coalition dominating land use to be strangled.
After much criticism last year's elections, the ruling party with its allies received the last place to be held by the opposition, and now it holds all the seats in this House.
At the same time, tensions on the border against Eritrea are increasing, and the battle along this tense and controversial border demanded hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics fear that separatist groups such as Oromo Liberation Front or Ogaden National Liberation Front, which over the past few years have been more or less defeated, can try to use the death to benefit and rearme.
Numerous factors explain why bitter emotions are now exploding after years of swelling.
The first seems to be seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Only in the last few years has a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate through social media when cheaper smartphones have become widespread and Internet service has improved.
Even if the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during demonstrations, many people can still communicate through hidden network media services.
Many young Ethiopians said that this was how they met for demonstrations.
Secondly, Ethiopia's two major ethnic groups, gold moths and amharats, are getting along better.
Oroms and amhars are not natural allies.
For a very long time, the Amhars, who come mainly from the Christian high places of Ethiopia, were successful in politics and business using oroms, many of which are Muslims and live in the fields.
But this is changing, too.
"We're on our way to an organization under one umbrella," said Goldmooder Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest demonstrations have been in Amhara and Golden Moon areas.
Many Amhars and Golden Moors believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigre people, covering about 6% of the population and dominating armed forces, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the restlessness is the loss of Meles Zenaw.
Meles, former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
They thought he was a tactical genius, a man who saw him around the corners.
Analytics say that he was particularly qualified to observe early signs of dissatisfaction and to use secret ambassadors to make opponents harmless.
"The current administration does not have such a basic insight," said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was picked relatively unknown to fill Meles' boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Ethiopian tiger area, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analytics say tiger-controlled security services don't trust him.
Many fear that this can lead to increased bloodshed.
For the last time, Ethiopia was in power of such an outcry in 2005, when thousands of people showed their minds about the elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been squandered by the government first and then robbed them.
In the aftermath of the effective attack, many demonstrators died, although less than in recent months, and that period of restlessness passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as a new train to work, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But clearly this has not stopped the inner resentment of the Ethiopian government.
And now it starts to get a dangerous, ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the city of Amhara in Gondar attacked Tiger-owned companies, and anti-Tiger hatred becomes increasingly common in social media.
Analytics say that the protests put the United States and other Western Americans in a clumsy position.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights to a neighbouring country in Somalia, although some time ago it has said that it has closed this base.
Although the Western countries clearly want to support democracy, they also do not want the unstable alliance of their region to collapse.
"This," Abdi said, "is a real balance."
Donald Trump explains his Obama-perusist-Issin claim as "sarkasm"
Donald J. Trump attempted to suppress his latest campaign in power on Friday by arguing that he was not serious this week when he was numerous times in the Indian that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic terrorist group.
The report raised new questions about the ability of the Republican presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also placed his defenders, who have pinned up to defend him during the stormy period, in a difficult position where they must explain the observations that he does not necessarily mean.
After the suggestion at the Wednesday evening campaign meeting, Trump claimed the same thing more and more zealously during Thursday's interviews, in which he instigated that his purpose was indeed to say that the President and Clinton created Iss.
In the early Friday morning Twitter publication, however, Trump said that he was only sarcastic.
The publication was a full text from the previous day when Trump said that he was really serious about the accusation in several interviews.
When conservative radio editor Hugh Hewitt attempted to help Trump slip his remark by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy Iss, the Republican presidential candidate took this in his ears.
The latest critical storm will come in a situation where Trump has attempted to re-centralize his campaign in the midst of the results of opinion research into the economy.
Trump and Clinton fought for the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
Running back to Twitter, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he considered speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defense before.
Later in July, when he faced a wide-ranging criticism when he suggested that the Russians should hack Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his remarks by saying "I am certainly sarcastic".
The approach makes it possible for Trump to go to the borders of the political talk and then return, if necessary.
"I think it's a model where he testes certain messages that are important to his fans. He sees how they work and then 'clears out' in direction or another depending on the reaction," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has followed the use of both candidates' language.
But I also think that he is slim about his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be filtered through several different lenses.
Rather than mitigating his speeches for the large polling audience, Trump has been more blurred in recent days after his popularity has continued to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey on Friday showed that Trump is significantly lagging behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and that the race is tight in Florida.
Although Trump generally seeks to avoid apologies for provocative matters he often blames his critics for misunderstanding his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces an ever closer review over the last few months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies to uncomfortable position in which they must publicly support him regardless of how provocative his remarks are.
Former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, made a great deal of effort in defending the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe that in his words there are real, political comments," Giuliani said when he was asked about the truth in connection with Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic state.
It's true in the sense that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization he called amateur, totally wrong, and that's why this happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq.
Most Republicans of the mainstream attempt to claim that the Obama government, in which Clinton worked as Foreign Minister, allowed Daddy to get worse because it did not manage effectively to deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Before the meetings of Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued on Twitter to attack the news media, which flouts her every word and are impartial against her.
He mocked "bad, pathetic" television experts who tried to find out about him, saying, "They won't succeed!"
Some democrats mocked Trump's excuse as a new evidence that he was an inappropriate president.
Previously on "Closed Cafe" is going back to Greenpoint.
Verb Cafe was a reluctant, only cash-acceptable place in Williamsburg, where there was no wireless network, but that offered good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the side of Bedford Avenue was too expensive for it.
The movement, which replaced Verb in summer 2014, Soap Cherie, sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the latest loss in a city that was being reformed to medium - class.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is broken and Verb is now a soap shop."
But if New York is a change, it's also a re-invention.
Last November, the revived Verb opened to Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has a wifi and you can pay for credit cards, but some of the staff are still the same and there is the same unspeakable mood.
The coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term worker in the old cafeteria, who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started in Verb in 2001 and was there until the end.
When the client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was excited.
Rodriguez, 36, kept many things unchanged.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso machine.
It even used old Verb's lights.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try.
He brought new ingredients.
Bacon egg cheese sandwiches are available in the restaurant, and the coatings include kaprix and browned onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
There's no more beer in the coffee room, but there's fresh juice.
In nine months, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady flow of old stock clients.
"Williamsburg also became too expensive for many former customers," he said.
One of last Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he went to the cafeteria.
He says that after Verb closed down, he gave up the coffee drink for a while.
"I understood that I enjoyed Verb's coffee and culture," he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although on that day he ordered his usual ice cream instead of mixed chai drink, which is one of the new additions.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully in Verb since 2003.
He went there before work and always made the same order.
"Every day fifteen more than seven, regularly as a watch, I went in and they were preparing spices with my bagel butter," he said.
The photograph. Rodriguez said he wanted to do experiments and bring new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes his usual order, but sometimes because of the variation, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez says he doesn't bear resentment for the soap shop that took over the old farms.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verb a special soap that would be used as a ingredient for cold-drawn coffee in the cafeteria.
"I think we can still take the offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also accepted the cafeteria.
One of these new customers turned the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it up to some point soon to make his new neighbor feel welcome.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold extracted coffee.
It's possible that the cafe is expanding to the next building.
A lot of customers have enough to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a stock customer and said it was uncomfortable when the place was closed.
When the new place was opened, Whitt said that he felt like he had come home when he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I needed to smell it," he said.
A Square Meal: Launching food
In March 1933, soon after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down for lunch in his office.
As a sweet mouth, President Roosevelt liked the refined Fifth Avenue foods, such as the goose mackerel, and Maryland's sucrose.
On that day his diet was more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes and desserts from the peanut.
"It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer," said Jane Ziegelman.
His husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's latest book, Chop Suey, told about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life from Lower East Side floor house through food in his book 97 Orchard.
Their latest cooperation, A Square Meal, which Harper publishes on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the great demise of the 1930s.
By showing some kind of culinary solidarity, they meet with the journalist at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, unspeakable lunch bar in the Flatiron area, which has been operating since 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered fresh cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a dose with turkey, potatoes and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat fraction, the couple considered it appropriate to discuss eating the period of demise.
"The worries were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was a peanut fracture, a liver fracture, a bean fracture.
They were made from the manufacturing material and some cheap ingredient that continued with the actual manufacturing material.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they would make your dinner.
Coe's out of his mind.
"It must have felt like a lead fat in the stomach," he said.
Over the years before the decay, the American tables, especially in the countryside, were like a dining-and-great-and-jaksat pick-up table.
Women's groups made food for male farm workers, and fresh pie was served in breakfast, lunch and dinner.
The Americans sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronized ways in which the nation survived that suddenly it was no longer a country of supremacy.
"Then the food became a central, distressing theme for the Americans," Coe said explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
The same was a new, affordable diet: Mystery foods, such as murecks and boxes, became the main foods, and the box was "a powerful way to use foods," Ziegelman mentioned, as the cooks were able to hide the less attractive ingredients under a creamy sauce layer.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
The meat, which had been in the center of American foods for years, became a finely administered luxury product.
Special compositions were tested with calorie and nutritional concentrations more important than taste or even healthy sense in the kitchen.
When doing the study, Ziegelman also prepared a food species for the period in which baked onions were filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition to the dinner table," Coe said.
Ziegelman specified, "It was unreal."
The peanut butter is in no way suitable for fried onions.
This was characteristic of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Household Agency in 1923-1943, guided the country's eating habits more than ever before or after.
The recipes and articles of the publishers in the newspapers and magazines encouraged women to start becoming "budgets" and to respond to the challenge of converting so-called spaghetti and carrots into tasteful doses.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical tastes.
Specially tasty are reports of government reactions to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's letting me eat your cake gun.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood for simple, yowaiian rural food, he mealed like a refined millionaire who had become him.
"He liked continental food, like fish with peanut sauce," Coe said.
He ate almost in a golden dining room with a tuxedo.
He was a great outsider of everything.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake unless his wife, Eleanor, had encouraged him to be an example in his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "provided not only the most dull of Washington, but also the most terrible food made."
Many of the skirmishes were abandoned as soon as the earth got back on its feet.
The tradition is that we continue to focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple said that when writing the book, they reached a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, such as how she could not throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "He even sickened people."
There's been a stroke.
After the dishes were empty in Eisenberg, he and Coe drew out the dessert they had prepared at home: the dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It is called a lumbar odour," Ziegelman added that the general trick was to give modest recipes a name showing them.
There was no creamy food, just lugs, a little flour, sugar, water, and cane.
Everyone unwillingly immersed their spoons in a smooth, brown leaster.
Surprisingly, it wasn't bad.
Coe snatched once and again.
Sounding like a positive budgeter, he told his wife, "a little bit of crippled German nuts could help."
Gilead will be compensated for as a lawyer in the fight against Hepatitis C patent Merck
The U.S. Judiciary has ordered that Gilead Sciences Inc be entitled to receive the costs of counsel incurred by him in the case of hepatitis C patient against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from 200 million dollars of payments after they violated two Merck patents related to Gilead's successful medicines in Sovald and Harvon, which followed when the US judge found Merck's abuses, including false oaths and other unethical practices.
In the judgment lodged on Thursday, Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead was entitled to waive compensation in opposition to a complaint.
Merck is trying to catch Gilead, who controls the market in a new generation of hepatitis C medicines, which can clearly improve more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The legal case will run in 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other for the active substance of Gilead medicines on the base of sofosbuvir's laboratory work.
The troops supported by the United States say that they have taken full control of the Manbij's ruled by Israel.
The US-supported troops have taken full power near the Turkish border of the northern city of Manbij after the last remaining Isis fighters left the city, the group representative said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now exploring the city after the last group of fighters hidden in the city left.
Reuters was told by the troops that more than 2,000 civic flags were released from the Allied Force of Sharfan Darwish SDF, Manbij's Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we have begun to study it," he told Reuters.
Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published its 2015 tax return, which showed that the revenues of the Democratics' presidential candidate and his spouse in that year were $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 per cent.
In 2015 the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mainly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million of speaker compensation, and the former Foreign Minister announced that he had received 3 million publishers from Simon & Schuster's book, which reported his career in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton's vice-president, Senator Tim Kaine Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, published 10-year tax returns.
Their real federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting a measure for economic transparency," Clinton's campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in his statement.
In a sharp contrast to this Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and withdraws his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
Usually, the US presidential candidates publish their tax returns, even though the law does not require it.
New York businessman Trump's lawyers have appealed to the tax administration's audit as a reason for refusing to publish tax declarations.
"Your turn," Clinton's campaign assistant, Ian Sams, said on Twitter when publishing a link to democratic tax declarations.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he did not allow Trump to publish them until the audits are ready.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal to raise questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business and numerous other links to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken on the problem of online video released on Friday, bringing out visible Republicans who urge Trump to publish his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the problem in his financial talk in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for the last decades has done: he published his tax return," he told the public.
Politico has reported that Trump has not paid any or very little taxes in the two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist borrowed a number of tax lawyers and accountants on Friday, who said that the situation could still be the same.
The Federal Tax Prosecutions have become a problem in the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the nominated rule of the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that more than a million dollars a year would pay at least 30% of taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton meeting in Nebraska, Omaha, last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also undergoing a tax administration inspection, and that Trump is not "fearing" the tax collection agency, but the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Today, the real federal tax rate of Clintons living in Chappaqua in New York was about 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and their real combined tax rate was about 40.5 per cent.
Clinton's 2015 tax return showed that only $100 of their income came from salaries, unlike most Americans.
Their main assets were an affordable investment fund tied to the index, and Clinton reported $109,000 on dividends and interest income.

Chili powdered condoms and sausages enhance the protection of Tanzania's elephant
Natural protectors in Tanzania use unusual means to prevent elephants from wandering into human habitat areas - they throw animals with chili powder filled with condoms.
Keino has proved to be effective, and several years ago the idea of the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the US Nature Conservancy, has enhanced its advertising by training volunteers in the villages of Northern Tanzania to use an unviolent four-step way to protect homes and hundreds without harming animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
"Since we developed...the tools, we have detected a change in attitude in these communities. They are now much more confident that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them," Mr.
The first two steps keep the marking of the intruding elephant with the flashlight and the ringing of the horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we'll throw the so-called "chilipilvi."
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and ground and with a sausage, and then the condom is closed so that only the ignition wire will be visible.
When the condom is lit, it bursts out with a swamp and sprinkles the chili powder into the air.
One smell is usually enough to send the elephant in the other direction.
The last means is the trigger that shoots the Roman candle in the air, and the joyful one produces a loud, bright explosion.
RT News: A Jewish filmmaker criticized a Berlin hotel that removed Israel's direction number at the request of the Arabs
After revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list Israel's target number, a French, Jewish-based filmmaker reported that this is due to the "requests" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, a documentary film from the Holocaust, demolished his frustration at the Berlin Hotel Kempinski Bristol, writing an open letter in the German publication FAZ.
During its recent nights, Lanzmann tried to find the Israeli hotel in the country's directory list.
However, the country was not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel has been removed and erased?
Lanzmann wrote.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers an opportunity to call Israel through its own telephone center.
When looking for an explanation, the filmmaker spoke about it at the hotel's reception.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received from it "striked him."
The hotel's prescriptionist said it was a "considered decision of the Kempinski Hotel Management".
The reason behind the decision caused even more shock in the filmmaker.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs, and they demand the removal of Israel's direction number," said Lanzmann.
Israeli German Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "great wrong", Zuddeutsche Zeitung reports.
"We were terrified and shocked because of the case.
It is already a great wrong in itself.
But even greater shame is that this happened in Germany and in this hotel chain.
This doesn't need any explanation.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident produced quite a reaction online when people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski hotel simply "referred" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Disgrace" was said in another publication, which noted that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm street is standing near the synagogue.
The hotel itself denied all charges quickly and called the incident "inconsistency" and "apologies" from Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"A clear command not to include Israel in the list of quick choices was never made," says Suddeutche Zeitung, a representative of Kempinsk.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber against Brazilian students who showed their minds
On Thursday, students joined the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo, as students gathered to show their minds against government education reforms.
The police used tear gas and rubber against demonstrators.
Problems began when law enforcement officials tried to break up the student group, which led to police using rubber and tear gas.
Several hundred students participated in the demonstration to express their horror about plans.
According to Sao Paolo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin's proposals, less than 100 public schools would be closed and 300 000 students would be reinvested to save money.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were seen writing on the walls the antigraphs against the temporary President Michel Temer.
This latest demonstration took place only days after the protesters moved on as a group to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was arrested in office, when the Senate voted on his charges.
RT Business: trade between Russia and Iran suddenly increases by 71 %
Since the removal of the sanctions, the turnover of trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70,9 per cent compared to the previous year, says the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since international sanctions against Iran were removed, Russian companies have largely demonstrated their interest in transactions in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue their existing ties to Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
"Naturally one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade," said Dzhagarya.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9 % compared to the same period of 2015, totalling $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 per cent, totalling $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
"The growth of the city was achieved through the supply of machinery, vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarya is also awaiting a record of Iranian tourists in Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Representative in Iran granted some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens mainly for travel.
Iran was also for the first time among the 20 countries most tourists in Russia.
"It must be safe to say that last year the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken," he said.
At the same time, quite few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved signs of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Scotti Callum Skinner stumbled into the paint when the British were hit by cycling gold.
Callum Skinner in Scotland fought for honor on men's team prints at the Rio bike stadium last night, when the British team's triangle defended its championship from London from 2012.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was an anchor in a role where his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy was rehabilitated, and the legend was proud of the young man when he fought against the winner of the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his sixth Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after being modestly placed in the sixth March World Championships in London, even though Hoy has then decided to compete.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff.
This could be done just in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's end also created a vacuum that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man whose British coaches were holding on to the potential in Scotland, which has now been realized.
Hindes, Kenny... who won today's championship four years ago... and Skinner made an Olympic record in time, but New Zealand took the lead on the first round.
And the British triangle won a duel on gold.
Hindes was completely behind his round, but Kenny put the team in charge, and Skinner held it.
The change in strategy was a big part of the change in form, and it included Hindes driving at a bigger range to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to hold on to the pace.
Today followed his position as an expert at the BBC, and drew the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the prize hub.
23-year-old glasgowish Skinner said, "Comparison is flattering."
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We made the final Olympics record, and we won the world champions.
It was incredible at the time.
There can't be a better way to win.
After winning in London 2012 with Kenny and Hoy, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately fallen on the track after a bad start.
He later drew his remarks back, and British competitors have not complained.
This time, there was no similar problem with overpower.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London when there were so many British flags on the jacuzzi."
As a team, we found a connection in the last three months.
We have lost so many world championships, so winning the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, a gold medal for the people who won seven out of ten bikers in both Beijing and London.
If this reflects the development of the last five months, we will be expected to be successful for five days in the bike stadium.
On the basis of Kenny's rightness, it is not impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's urine, winning three Olympics in the Olympics.
That would mean that Kennyn - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (seemably on that holy day in British sports, which is also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister's birthday) - the total of medals would rise to six gold and one silver.
It'd be the same as Hoylla.
Kenny is next competing on a sprint that starts today and lasts three days.
A 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I'm just enjoying this one now.
The team race is always the best.
It'll be won together with friends.
Winning alone is, honestly, lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should be given the value of a knight."
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were in time the fastest four-mile team guarantee.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record of gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and final (22.42) will be held today, on the second day of competition, when Wiggins will certainly be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time drives when the officials invited him to the length measurement.
In the corresponding women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavian Katie Archibald advanced in world record at the time of the clock stop at 4:13:260.
The British team has learned to trust that its mighty tracking team will take over the middle of the Olympics and achieve a whole range of medals.
After presenting truly exceptional and complete control in Beijing and London, expectations have been reduced before the Rio races.
There has been a drama in the background, the least of which has not been the difference between the technical leader, Shane Sutton, in April due to sexism and temptation charges, and the end of the race of major people such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's competitions in the bike stadium, it seems that the legendary reputation of Britain now rises to its peak at a perfect moment could once again be true.
Portland's melted-out future due to a dubious power contract cut
The future of Portland Victoria's aluminium sink, as well as hundreds of jobs, is uncertain when the electricity-distributing company revealed that one of the owners of the factory is terminating the distribution contract, so it is expected that all distribution contracts will be cut.
The measure will follow the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian administration that the aid required to maintain the plant in operation will not continue.
The aid for the 20-year period ends in November.
Even 2,000 jobs may be at risk at the Alcoan Portland factory.
Even 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, with the closure of the plant.
In addition, snowball effect may be possible, as the melting uses about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014 Alcoa closed Point Henry's meltdown, which led last year to the shutdown of Anglesea power plant.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown is losing money and underneath the peace of closure.
The measure now follows speculation for several years from the future of the factory, which began with a strong Australian dollar and has recently been the result of the factory's production price.
AGL, which distributes electricity to a large aluminium tube from Loy Yang An in Latrobe Valley, said that it also expects three other owners to terminate their contract.
Most of the factory is owned by the Alcoa and Alumina group, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own smaller shares.
"AGL awaits the continuation of the operation of the Portland plant, which means that the unsmelted physical electricity needs will continue," he said.
According to AGL, the agreements are so-called "protection agreements", which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have 12 months of termination, so they will actually end in 2017.
"That is why AGL expects the result of the contracts for the financial year 2017," the electricity company said.
All possible impacts on AGL from 2018 onwards are currently limiting the strong prospects of the future market for electricity wholesale prices.
AGL said that it has already reduced the value of contracts by $187 million in its accounts.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the agreements "does not affect Alcoa ... the ability to keep the melting in operation or to secure the unsmelted electricity supply".
The U.S. company stated that it concluded a 20-year Loy Yang agreement in 2010 and that the agreement had to enter into force in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it was withdrawn from the agreement.
The analysts have been cautious both because of the melting of the Portland in Victoria and because of the possible closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, because of the poor economic situation in the sector.
Previously in the week, the CEO of AGL Stephen Mikkelsen told the analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
‘If both factories leave the market, this is a significant reduction in the demand for [electric] markets.
For us as an electric producer, this would not be a good thing," he said.
Kendall, not just Kardashian's real TV star, is on the cover of September Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and mother manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's fourth daughter, is on the cover of the US Vogue's desired September number.
Kendall, a brand-new envoy of Estee Lauder, who was a model for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday in his Instagram account.
"Looking at this deck in a room full of loved ones made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The publication followed a unique (or perhaps just the Kardashian style?) handwritten reality video where the whole Kardashian-Jenner clan (excluding the problem cases of Rob and Caitlyn, and related to all the favorite entertainment uncle, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot the cover of his sister, but which ended in the classical translation: they planned a surprise party.
This is a classic plot of almost every child's television series "birthday season" (Seacrest says the words "you didn't think we'd forget you" with the credibility of the morning-drawn puppy junk), but Kriss had to get her other girls somehow to benefit from this publicity.
This is because we have surely moved to the new Kardashian era with the place of Vogue in September.
Kendallin's big sister Kim may have gotten to Vogue's action first (he shared it with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is quite his own class.
Vogue's number of September is the most sellable edition of the year.
Its thickness resembles more coffee tables than fashion accounts, and the number attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion calculated that from last year's 832 page teaching 615 was advertising content).
The discovery of this star is so fast expected that for the last two years the images of the magazine have leaked before the official publication.
Previous women on decks have been Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years there have indeed been more "publics that act as models" than "models that are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior's ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on deck in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga's honor.
But if it happened that Jenner, described by the magazine as his generation's "success model", would hit the above-mentioned category, he is in a pretty good company.
These celebrities are not famous people's relatives or reality stars or young people today who can make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all this).
They are rightly talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of his career since the publication of Lemonade last year.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
His real TV history, Jenner's position in the fashion world, will always be difficult.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadid calling them "the bitch of this moment".
This feeling rose again with Jenner's Vogue deck.
But spinning in dissatisfaction is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue's September number.
He's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's a model for Marc Jacobs.
He's selling you Estee Lauder makeup.
He and all of his sisters sell you pictures of themselves in their own, wall-backed applications.
He sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter who he took to the LOVE magazine.
And in his free time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and this kid, he's a real TV star.
The Community's legal centres turn 160 000 people away every year
More than 160 000 of the most vulnerable people are being turned away each year from the Community's legal centres when the sector prepares for the effects of additional financial cuts on its activities already at the extreme limits.
Three of the five people in Queensland - mainly elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no chance of fighting unfair decisions and similar - are already turned away in their search for free legal advice and representation.
Legal services already stretched to the Community's extreme limits are preparing for additional cuts.
In June next year, these legal centres will lose 30% of their federal funding.
The head of the Queensland Community Legal Centres James Farrell said that the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres report indicates that thousands of people are already being turned away annually.
Farrell said that if the decision of the federal government is not withdrawn, the situation will only worsen.
"The juridical centres of the Queensland Community are chronically underexpenditured, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the essential services they need every year," he said.
People who leave violent relations with uncontrolled and unrestrained debts, families divorced, unjustly separated workers - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they will not get the help they need.
The Federal Government will cut funding by 30 % in June 2017, meaning that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents will have to navigate in the midst of complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Justice Minister and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately withdraw these financial cuts so that people can get the help they need in their legal problems.
Last year, the state government made its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and its customer communities, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to justice after the employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was challenged to the court that, according to the claim, they did nothing after they were told that the head of the North Carolina campaign threatened the worker with a gun in February while driving in Jeep.
The incident was described by the former software practitioner of the state campaign, Vincent Bordin, on Wednesday in Charlotte, in the State Court.
Bordini said that he waited months for the situation to be dealt with internally before he realized that "it would not happen".
Chief Earl Phillip "pulled out the gun, put his right front finger on the trigger and pushed the pipe against Vincent's knees," Bordini said in the complaint.
After choosing for the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had similar experience with Phillip, he said in the complaint.
"You don't have to fire weapons to cause damage," Bordini said in the complaint.
The challenge will only come two days after the republican presidential candidate made an anger in telling the public in North Carolina that "the people of another addition" - usually the owners and gunmen - could take action if his competitor Hillary Clinton were to be elected and elected judges.
Trump's campaign said that the media has taken his word out of touch, and that he is not in favour of violence.
The challenge of Bordin is to seek compensation from the campaign for careless control and Phillip for violence, assault and emotional shock.
Trump's representative, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request for comments.
The attempts to reach Phillip didn't succeed.
WCCB, local news company Charlote, reported Phillip's leaving the campaign recently.
The call to Innovative Consulting Services submitted to his consulting firm was not answered immediately.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump campaign has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
British must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow
Heathrow brings recovery and bloom to the whole country, not just to local communities and all over London.
For me this was the great charm of Heathrow, just as it was the attraction of the 2012 London races, when we had a huge effort to ensure that all our people and regions would benefit from the races.
The Olympics made huge benefits for Stratford and East End.
And we will do so again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
Only 10 000 new training places and 40 000 new jobs are created for local communities and youth unemployment is eliminated around the airport.
Just as before the 2012 contests in London, some come to think that the challenge of extending Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the races and that we would be ashamed before the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
Obstacles are always to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question that is put to him.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also a infrastructure project for many, not only for few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and 211 mrd GBP economic growth, leaving the legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and around Britain.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has carried out an 11 mrd. pound infrastructure investment programme in time and in the budget to remain: T5, which has been voted for the best airport terminal in the world five years in a row, to T2, which was built between the two most urgent runways in the world.
Now the team is ready to carry out a third runway, supported by £16 pounds of private money.
The Olympics in London in 2012 were a great success for Britain, and I am convinced that Heathrow's expansion is also a success.
It is time for us to channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow's, ensure the future of our commerce and create a legacy of skills and employment, for which Britain can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Heathrow Board and former Trade Secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook cat and mouse games on preventing advertising
For companies that receive money from online advertising, companies to skip the advertising program are "kick and mouse plays," said one of the companies that manufactures such a program.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would prevent advertisers from using their computer websites, Adblock Plus published a blog post which stated that users can update the program filters to prevent advertisements again on the social network pages.
On Tuesday, Facebook said that its website code will be exchanged around ads to make advertising inhibitors more difficult to detect which parts of the page are advertisements.
But now Adblock says that it's circumvented the new code.
In a blog post by Adblock, Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of a forward-looking struggle between the community that prevents the advertising of the open source code and its riders has been underway since the invention of the prevention of the advertising", and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come up with its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has taken part in the fight is a strong sign of the great grief of advertising inhibitors for industry.
Globally, about 200 million use ad inhibitors, reported last year's Pagefair and Adobe research, which is almost four times the amount that used these programs in 2013.
1.03 million active daily users use Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile ads now cover 84% of Facebook advertising revenues.
The company is, however, behind web advertisers using computers, as mobile advertisers do not operate on Facebook mobile applications to the social network or Instagram, said the representative.
Computer ads still bring enough revenue to Facebook's view as worth investing.
On Tuesday, Facebook also said that it would update its "advertising" tool to give people more power in terms of how advertisements are targeted to them.
On Thursday Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were worrying because they would also prevent part of the site from being non-advertising.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we have plans to tackle the problem," Facebook's representative said in an e-mail statement.
Ad inhibitors are boring tools, and instead we have concentrated on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give people control.
The woman was under the car on the Swiss motorway, apparently because of suicide.
The victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses after a woman was left on the motorway in several early hours of Thursday's undercarriage, apparently a suicide.
The incident occurred on the A1 road near Morges'ta Vaudi's canton just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman did a "desperate act" and settled in the dark to lie on the road where she was hit by several vehicles, the police of Vaudi said in the statement.
The victim, who clearly tried to kill himself, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who hit several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers related to the event have already been interrogated, but not all have yet been identified, told the police who appeal to them and all witnesses who witnessed the incident to register.
Criminal investigation has begun, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
"But let's see if any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
It's going to be settled by the prosecutor," Hofstetter said.
In the last five years, two similar cases suggest that drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, in both cases, a person who walked on a dark motorway was estimated to be unable to expect drivers to meet a pedestrian in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were released from the charges in connection with the death penalty due to omission after he hit and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and turned out on the road, and the court was told.
The Court stated that the police, who were responding to an emergency call, drove in a justified manner, and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has information about the Thursday case near Morges should call the police number 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus once had to live
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus probably had to live once.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to find out whether Venus would have had a warm, waterless surface and an airline filled with carbon dioxide that could sometimes be Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously pretended that Venus' slow rotation speed explains its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earthlike atmosphere, and still could have rotated slowly.
The model also examined the formation of the surface of the early Venus.
The planet was likely to have more dry areas than Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic variation to enable life and rapid water evaporation.
The advantage of the early Venus was also 30% lighter than the sun.
"In the simulation of the GISS model, Venus' slow rotation reveals its day side to the sun for almost two months at a time," explains GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in the news release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud covering that acts as an umbrella protecting the surface from the sun's heat in large terms.
As a result, the average climate temperatures are actually a few degrees cooler than the Earth's current temperatures.
The model produced a story from the development stages of Venus, which is similar to what the planet scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely to be inhabited sometime, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet hall over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapors burned in the ultraviolet.
When its hydrogen escaped, there was only a thick CO2 atmosphere left with its deadly greenhouse gas effects, Venus, which we now know.
Researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy quits the Avalanche trainer's plague.
Patrick Roy dismissed himself on Thursday from Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice-president of hockey affairs, saying that he was responsible for the lack of influence in the decision-making process of the team.
Mr. Joe Sakic, vice-president/chairman of Colorado, confirmed the information and mentioned that the team will immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have done my duty to Colorado as Deputy Director of hockey affairs in Avalanche and as the principal coach with enthusiasm, passion and determination," said Roy in his 50-year-old opinion.
During the summer I have long and earnestly thought about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and to take it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the opinion of the Coach and the Deputy Director-General for Hockey Affairs should be fully in line with the organisation's view.
He must also have an opportunity to influence decisions that affect team performance.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization, and we wish him luck in the future.
Roy was appointed winner of the Jack Adams Award to the Best Coach of the League in his first Avalanche period 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and the middle division to win, but Minnesota dumped the Colorado drop games in the first round, and the team hasn't been able to go on in the last two years.
The games of Avalanche in the period 2015-16 ended with 39 wins, 39 loss and 4 matches, and the team lost five points for Wild, losing the wild card drop place in the Western Conference.
Hall of Famee elected goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cupia - two both in Montreal Canadiens and Avalanche.
Oil workers in the North Sea continue negotiations and postpone strike
The work of oil workers in the North Sea is postponed due to wages, as all parties in the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, said the leading negotiators.
The strikes against Wood Group are occasionally organised by Royal Dutch Shell, led by the North Sea drilling vessels.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to reopen a process aimed at resolving the current dispute," said the joint opinion.
During the next few weeks, we will hold several meetings all day, starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to professional associations, their recent work-fighting activities, which they claim to be the first for more than 25 years, were an objection to possible, up to 30% of wage cuts.
This year, Wood Group cut the rewards of North Sea contractors by around 9% due to negative market pressure.
The company's premium reduction will result in a 10 % reduction in the number of contractors in its countries from 2014.
The company stated that the additional cuts would provide the company with the necessary moving space to survive the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people's wage lists and announced its plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries when the company reduces its activities as a result of its giant merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of the lowest prices of crude oil, and this economic situation worsens the British decision to leave the European Union in June.
The Scottish Member of Parliament, Dave Anderson, met the federal leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the major disputes in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
"We need an economy that works for many, not only for few, both in the North Sea and throughout the country," he said in his statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects, while the average of the previous five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of the stars in the Plejadis Stars
The latest mission of Kepler's astronomers has helped the astronomers to collect the most complete list of the speeds of spinning the stars of the Plejadis.
The new information helps astronomers to understand why the stars of the crowd rotate at varying speeds, as well as how cycles relate to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of stars, its age and even the history of the solar system," said Luisa Rebull in the press release of Caltech's infrared processing and analysis of Pasadena Centre.
Plejadi's starjob is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars have been born about 125 million years ago, and are now reaching adulthood.
They're rolling at their top now.
At its peak wheel speed, these grown stars flow large quantities from the astronomer.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
When the star gets older, its rotation speed starts to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star by following the appearance of identifiable star pits, such as sunpits.
The latest list of star rotation speeds indicates that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers who make devils slower than smaller ones.
"Pleads in the "ball" we see that slow rotators are usually more massive, while the fastest rotators are usually very light stars," Rebull said.
Since Plejadi's star group is so close, it is an ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating star characteristics at rotation speeds.
"The Plajadi star range offers an anchor for spinning stars to theoretical models that include both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
We still have a lot to learn about how, why and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and so it is said to hang their 'dance keg' in the nail.
Rebull and his colleagues described their latest analysis of Plejadis' rotation speeds in three articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
