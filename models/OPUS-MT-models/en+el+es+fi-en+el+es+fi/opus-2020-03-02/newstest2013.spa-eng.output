A Republican strategy to impede Obama's re-election
The Republican leaders justified their policy for the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and states that electoral fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people dying from the fall of a ray.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In that regard, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Unlike what happens in Canada, the American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in that same line, a majority of American governments promulgated, starting in 2009, new laws that hindered the registration or voting process.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to an American citizenship test.
On the other hand, these laws reduce advance voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the poll and withdraw their right to vote to citizens with a criminal record.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state demanded that voters present a photographic identity document.
The Indiana State was the first to demand it.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of Indiana's law.
The Republican authorities therefore rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity document with photography.
It is important to bear in mind that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security Card.
In fact, 11 per cent of American citizens, i.e. 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photographic identity documents issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with these characteristics.
But often, obtaining the required identity card costs more than $100.
Thus, new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 per cent of African Americans, 15 per cent of people who earn less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65 years of age and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 years of age do not have a photographic identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states students, the voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
Moreover, the same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who often vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by such clubs.
Before 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to present such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic party.
On the other hand, Republican legislators supported in 2011 certain laws that abolished the registration of voters on the same day of the scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 resulted in a fall in the registration rate for new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators adopted laws in five other states that favoured the reduction of the advance voting period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented no more than 13% of the state voters.
In the case of Hispanics, the same thing happened exactly.
They represent no more than 11% of the voters, equivalent to 24% of the citizens voting in advance.
However, whites, representing 76 per cent of the electorate, represent only 46 per cent of the citizens voting in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Public Prosecutor's Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states adopted the law requiring the presentation of a photographic identity document.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted, as it is clear that they intend to influence the results of 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that the states that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to affirm with certainty whether these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this regard, measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Detection: Do the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test presents sometimes erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, whether reluctant to themselves, doubt whether or not detection tests should be carried out.
Do the test or not?
We've asked for advice from two specialists.
Studies in the United States detected a high rate of contagion among sample groups, making such data difficult to interpret and making firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between the patients who had been detected and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years of age, also showed that there are between 30 and 40 per cent chances of suffering from metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer has been detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are painless.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the degree of risk of his or her cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not care for long-term life, in which case he or she should choose to have an active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men who have been detected with cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest an active surveillance of the disease and, if this progresses, we offer them a treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool to evaluate the pros and contras of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miraculous recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risks of disease.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
"If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%," says André Beaulieu, spokesperson for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we evaluate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
It greatly harms people's health.
"Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec," said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The weight
Fatness and obesity also favor the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
The risks of breast, colon and rectum cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus increase.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against breast cancer," they add.
Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they increase the risks of colorectal cancer.
Charcuteria products should also be avoided.
Preserving the meat for smoking, drying or salination may lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"They can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," they explain.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, for the time being, their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies about vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed was rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each other's concerns and family history with his doctor.
"Doing the detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physics it's not entirely clear that it's Higgs.
We certainly know that there is a new particle and that it looks a lot like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at an important physics congress held in Kyoto seem to confirm that it is, although more data are still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume it's Higgs, as the chances of being wrong seem few.
There is, in this great world, a widespread and inescapable law that implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to violate that rule and don't try too hard, because it will end up hurting itself.
Although particle physics are a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of Pauli's exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, grossly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicians classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we meet the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli's beginning.
And on the other hand there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists that has no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratory's website The Particle Adventure, which is, by the way, extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, of which we won't talk here, and the "power particles", by which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, you could underline here, they're not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you succeed in reading this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinaryly banal boson: the photon or the "light particle" that acts as a "mensager" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electrical load accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" is born an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolets, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "power carriers".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it, it takes to reach extremely high energies, a little like it was an iced pond in which only a thick rock could slip through the surface.
That's why we need an immense particle accelerator like that of CERN (the big hadron collider is a 27 km ring of circumference!) to achieve such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never be held by itself attached to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way), do not have it.
Now, what can they "provid" all these investigations?, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physics to scrutinise the differences between the observations and the predictions of the MS.
For their part, many fervently want them to be found, as the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that tapes certain holes of the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, such as that it does not propose any explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (other ups!).
But we have not found such differences in CERN so far.
Impact
The impact of such research on our day-to-day is difficult to predict, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that it will have none.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, the laser pioneers in the laboratories did not at all suspect the revolution that their work would cause.
They were interfering with scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle already said, who worked at the Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pressed) in 1962, at first the laser was considered a "laboratory device".
Imagine...
In addition, applications can also come from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light captor in 1969 in the course of his optic research.
Although it was not at all its original intention, this captor now serves as a "eye" for all the digital devices in the world, which the Nobel of physics earned him in 2009.
That doesn't mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die...
In his Dying Commission in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate should be resumed soon while a draft law was being prepared.
However, within that essential domain, there is still much to be done.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment at the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've already been like this seven years ago," she tells, made a pass, lying in her bed in the center of palliative care Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, to which she arrived the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," he continues.
The disease has caused him to be ravaged: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetite lunch, he accepts resignation to help him eat.
He's brave, even smiling, talking to strangers who pay attention to him, bringing him medications and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is to be cured by diarrhea, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy to that evil.
"In the course of our lives we learn that a man is peeing on foot," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist in the center of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to their childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
"That depends on the ability of the person to accept that regression," he notes.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in palliative care, the great moments take place in the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a life expectancy of up to three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer the "curative" care.
The greatest fear of Ms. A., 89, is to die "conscious and drowned."
But the disease has made her discover her children.
"I have some good children," he adds.
"I no longer have any more desires in this life," he says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And he waits, in the next few days, for a last visit of his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois it is offered, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and helps the food.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help his death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a bed of palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, since we know we'll all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouth rinses with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday night we served Mr. X a beer, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, your son finished his beer at the deceased's feet.
"We help both patients and loved ones," says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who tastes his last family reunion in the courtyard, well placed among his pillows while all drink to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 years of age who have had cancer," Dr. Christiane Martel is worried.
53% of patients admitted to Victor-Gadboisarrivent Center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of his life, whether at home, in hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the palliative care society at the Grand Montréal home, are specialized almost exclusively in caring for patients with cancer.
It is precisely that great relative lack in Quebec's health care that causes many doctors specialized in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminencies of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone has the right to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
"Recently," he relates, "I have seen a patient spend 14 days in Urgents suffering great pains without what has been done to alleviate her.
I'm afraid patients want to die just because they don't get the right care."
And parallel, many oncologists are obstinated with their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Hélène Richard's survival hopes were already low when he left a treatment of exhausting chemotherapy.
"When I told my oncologist I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that it was very bad for me to want to stop fighting," she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask for death thank their caregivers for not meeting them in their demands once their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at Grand Montréal's home, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the time of his death, either sporadicly or permanently.
We can't pretend we don't understand that part of suffering.
Increasingly, unrelieved disease will have the possibility of this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved say the same thing: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want euthanasia," but "I want to be relieved."
This report has been made possible through a journalism scholarship from Canada's health research institutes.
Real estate scandals of great amplitude in Quebec
Road network officials, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia account, day after day, for a formidable "system", of which the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafia are part.
A "industry" that came out too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's funny how the system sprays once we've hunted the big media," ironed Jacques Duchesneau, deputy in Quebec and former head of the Montreal Police.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was possible thanks to an in-depth investigation of the malversations linked to road contracts in Quebec, which the liberal Prime Minister at that time, Jean Charest, had only consented to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party financing and corruption among officials.
"From the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved $1 billion in contracts," containing some of its instincts to keep a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," she adds, while hoping to be able to "demonstrate the existing strtages behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also implemented with its team of government interveners, researchers and analysts.
This unit operates in addition to the "Marteau squad" police, which, since 2009, have made the Montreal sewage cartel moderate when inflating contracts.
Over the past few weeks, the unit has recorded a series of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city outside.
The next of the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post as mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been embedded in exchange for public contracts.
Engineers from the Montreal road network and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, have been formally charged.
The latter has caused shock in explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia that transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
M. Zambito distributed money on a right-handed and sinister basis during the 2000s, granting more than $88,000 (approximately €68,000) to provincial parties, especially to the liberals in power.
He also admitted that he had organized a collection of illegal funds for the former Liberal Prime Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewage contracts
In Montreal, the "corruption system" worked effectively.
Gilles Surprerant, former public worksman, explained it perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey parties and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he incurred.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating invoices between 30 and 40 per cent for counterfeit extras.
In addition, a mayor's party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused M. Tremblay of deliberately making his sight fat on a parallel budget and filled his coffins with dirty money.
Following these revelations, M. Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elected policies that sounded the alarm.
As mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, he opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and resold for 1.6 million to the promoters in full real estate boom.
70 per cent of the money from electoral campaigns was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she assures that she pulls "from a thread to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrena and fish the guilty."
And he adds that the process is "painful, but positive."
We are cleaning the wounds but we would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices are not repeated.
How to clean up.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is concerned about the role of the ''elected politicians' in the news of the stratagema".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, it irons: "I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality."
The Quebequés government proposes to limit to 100 dollars the donations to parties, but that will not change the donation, according to him, "while electoral expenses are not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
It advocates a comprehensive review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of parties: "we cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, courageously, will allow us to rebuild the house with stronger foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story impedes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, M. Duchesneau invites those who would laugh to look in the mirror.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season has acquired a new entity with the PSG.
How would you explain that progress?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Big players have arrived.
I'm advancing day by day next to you.
Technical staff have also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that's easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get hot.
From my beginnings at INF Clairefontaine's pre-formation center to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced at aggravated steps.
He's going to benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer's recruits are used to contesting very high-level parties.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes a lot to my positioning.
It's backed up by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti's the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like that in League 1 and is among the best European trainers.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He's worked with big players.
I think he'll take other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has removed our position as leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the League of Champions: we have ranked for the eighth finals in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
Let's try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league in front of the Porto so we can get the turn of the eighths in the end.
Can the PSG become a large European short-term club?
You've got the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long term.
Today, that's not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is being handed over to its means to bring this project into practice.
Don't win the cup in League 1, like in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a great disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in taking us that title of champions.
We didn't get far in the last season.
In May we took a disappointment, as we had the best conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We're done with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a rather better season.
This year I think it'll be the good one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have the guns to take it away.
Do you think the media are expecting more of the PSG?
It's normal that you expect a lot of us if you think about what's been invested in the players we have.
We have fully accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home Troys, who still find things to blame for us, it's a little frustrating.
We wonder what else people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the League of Champions we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at the Manchester City that, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the eighth end, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage on the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "impulsed" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have finished taking the trophy.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's successes.
We'd better say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and has many goals.
He has come to prove that he is the star of League 1.
And he has shown in all the teams he's gone through that he's a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men around him.
What you have done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best advocates in the world, also allows us all to make progress.
How have you lived the 2012 EuroCup with the team of France?
It was a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating gambling time.
I saw things in there and I got stronger.
Today I manage to play good matches in the selection.
That's what I expected from my baptism with the "bleus."
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why we have exemplary behavior today.
What vision do you have from the first month of Didier Deschamps in front of the "bleus"?
He's getting results.
They are well located in the World Classification Group.
The selector is rigorous, close to players and inspires to win.
As was Laurent Blanc's case.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of classifying us for the European Cup.
I hope that Didier Descamps will take the selection to Brazil.
Did the tie (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to set the bases?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not lived a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
Moreover, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is at the same time a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol to the way BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 network computers.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
Bitcoin's contribution, after reaching the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning to the top of $10 today (the quotes are on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impressive if we compare it with global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in it in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "which competes with the dollar or the euro" and "like conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual coins such as "credits", used to advance a video game and that can be won playing or can be bought (and even sometimes exchanged).
The Facebook social network also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and deals with changes.
With the bitcoin, all network nodes are both depositaries of accounting books, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two e-mail addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the bitcoins changes are included in the public account book, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This is through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and the winner, a sort of interim central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file trimming phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
Computers "take" the new transaction and add a number before "troce" the set.
The aim is to find the number that offers a particular print (more zeros at first).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructably linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, one user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, as both have different prints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided into two regularly, likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but are divided up to the hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in calculating power.
The life of the network already has its heights.
Websites offering services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins have been stolen in storage.
"The failure used does not affect the same protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money-laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, like the Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Insitito Weizmann in Israel, analyzed the accounting book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November the "giant discounts" were launched.
"30,000 dollars were exchanged," Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, makes bitcoins gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that currency, believes quite a bit in the potential of this technology as well as in the transaction network.
Your system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but you use Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to start in shops, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They are enough to provide an address that a phone can "photograph and recognize", says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement to review hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
"It will take a while for Bitcoin to impose, but in 2013 there could be a change," he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB intends to revalue the various risks, which are now considered high, if this currency is successful.
We've left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to resume possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in the times of the Soviets.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks join their causes.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Westerns become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the almond hills thanks to the French credits, was made by order.
Truck and tank convoys returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country was wrapped in fire and blood because of the struggles between different factions.
Their taking control of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants surpassed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old mulahidines, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government lands to sell them as solars for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the field, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: capital leakage is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its population under 25 years of age, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
These young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or to the corruption of certain leaders will have to be given work.
All, including armed opposition, are avid to mobile phones. TV and its Turkish folletins presenting a modern world have great fans throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of Western nations. However, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, deleting the post of the prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth expanded.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerns were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the terrain and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining exploitation.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
It will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country that is heavily dependent on imports and exports, to re-establish their normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls ' schools, children ' s schools, a French university department, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "wind the hearts and spirits" and carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous collective work of interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountain towns.
These works, delicious of obtaining local labour, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increased cultivation surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military expenditure?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 metres high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
For them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled and direct civilian aid.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he decided to play the whole for all.
He surprised everyone on Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote for its final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the head of State had given that Assembly two more months to complete its work.
And it has been almost two years since Egypt has used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial embroidery.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president persevere in his "self-critical delusion" and continues to "treat his word" and "scroll the right".
On the part of its supporters, it is ensured that this is a measure to speed up the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that compels the Brothers to renounce their project to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, this is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversial causes ravages throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in their favour, as stated in an interview with American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "or they vote my text or I keep the full powers", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, the majority of Islamist, voted yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not come to the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they believed that they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added in a hurry yesterday morning.
Some of them are very close to Muslim Brothers.
As was expected, the articles voted unanimously.
On the other hand, commentators are pleased that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the Constituent's watch was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday afternoon, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of the Constitution of 1971, which stipulates that "the principles of the Sharia constitute the principal source of law, remains the subject of all considerations".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, hoped that "the principles" could be replaced by "the rules", which would have allowed stricter implementation.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
The liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing but an advertising artifact.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer in particular to article 220, which gives Al-Azhar University a consultative role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their conformity with the laws of the Shariah.
According to the Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to pronounce themselves are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy."
The fears of the liberals are also increased by the fact that the next rector of the university would be rather less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are in the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked on this text are not Ulemas but university, some of them trained in the French system," explains Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used imitate the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent civil judges are competent to pronounce themselves above all this."
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday received many criticisms regarding the extended powers conferred on the President of the Republic.
Muslim Brothers will claim that they are few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
The prosecution of civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights associations, will also not be prohibited.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider to be liberticated.
The crime of blasphemy is maintained and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president had to go out on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this noon.
The supporters of the Head of State expressed themselves on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are awaited by the holy land, the belly of the world, and a sea of salt.
The promised earth combines the majesty of Bible truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
Anyone who enters this "baptizing pile" is believed to receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking over the waters, the awe of the storm, and the nets filled.
In this same place, Jesus appeared before his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers travel here the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "Dolorous Way").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorio, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, it goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgota, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the place of the burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Blessed of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in the year 70 DC.
As it is tradition, people from different religions leave notes here with their wishes, which will then come true.
Make a vertical journey
The ruins of the Massed Fortress were what remained of a secret shelter against the enemies, which Herod the Great commanded to build in the year 25 B.C. for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, they can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit at the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a great influx of tourists.
There, from the foot of the hill, bus services are offered.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods were supposedly inhabited on the top of the mountain.
Visit Unique Museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one trip you won't be able to visit them all.
But it's worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
It preserves the ancient Manuscripts of the Dead Sea or Rolls of Qumrán, discovered in the caves of the Judea Desert, and about 500 thousand archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Art Museum in Tel Aviv.
In his exhibition of paintings he has canvases of impressionists and expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al Basha Museum-bath, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and swimmers of that time.
In Cesarea it is worth going through the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or future stores there.
The entrance is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Museum of the Holocaust or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children's Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars shine.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries where they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the temperature of the water does not decrease from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a slurry that easily hold up even those who don't know how to swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to spend treatment courses with salt water, salm and healing muds and fortify their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved by the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it, Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed the famous maritime route.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he took a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say if you touch the walls on the street of your "self" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds coming from all over Israel, and even from other countries to be photographed.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theatre, "take" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Cesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Poncio Pilato.
The theater, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists Remember
If you travel to Israel, don't worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to carry it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be switched to shéquels (now 1-3$,8 shéquels).
The urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City to the High City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Traveling in any type of public transport costs 6 shéquels and for this price you can travel by ferrying for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport interrupts your work.
But a new week of work begins on Sunday morning.
In many cafés, restaurants and hotels only Kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, seafood fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on cow and lamb meat, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, the falafel, which are molten chickballs, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-feed cats who "walk to their taste" in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of the parked cars.
The snorers love the crowded places and don't reject the candy.
The rental of a car, depending on the brand, will cost from 37$ (Hyundai Getz) to 188$ (Audi A6, Volvo S80) a day.
In addition to insurance, it goes out for $15 a day.
And a bike's renting him for 15 shekels a day.
The entrances to the museums cost an average of 30 shéquels.
Israel in figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were U.S. citizens, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, a quantity exceeding 51% of the same index for 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The great and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for language
While deputies and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that the law would bring on compulsory examination, there have already appeared in the country bullies that trade with "false" certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law enters into force, according to which every labour immigrant will have to carry out an examination to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For the time being, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the provision of services, Community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, the examinations will be made mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be sufficient to give consideration to the language, but also to the Russian history and the basis of the legislation.
The knowledge of the language must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew the work permit.
Citizens of countries where Russian is the official language are exceptions.
Persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 will not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centres will be hosted by the Pushkin Institute of Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the State University of Moscow, the State University of St. Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants can be tested in all cities, now in Russia more than 160 centres of this kind are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But the rights defenders, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually contribute?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for the Russians and for the immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, which will reduce the number of people suffering from "work slavery".
Many people today talk about the defence of the rights of labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Tajikistan.
The defence of their rights must be initiated prior to their departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of migrant workers in 90 per cent of cases.
Immigrants without profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical control have problems.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the immigrant future will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, on the pretext of helping, put a "payed little journey" into a scary and narrow covacha, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received countless complaints from our immigrants.
"In their homeland they promise one thing, but when they arrive they are deceived, deprived of their passports, do not pay them the promised wages," confirms the head of the Labour Immigration Directorate of the Tajikistan Immigration Service, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, little boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that not only do they not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write hard in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: there are few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don't even have anything to feed children, not to mention dressing them, wearing them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching the adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It's hard, if you don't know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, with regard to the language law, rights defenders point to an important point.
The examinations will be carried out only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and consequently no official work.
Meanwhile, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Welcome or banned passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false registration can be made quickly and for only a thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police employees know that we usually carry false documents, we're not registered and the cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told journalists.
"Come on, don't be tacky, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was revealed that not only immigration registration documents can be false.
Several "false" language knowledge certificates have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
Forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came to the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker 3,000 rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diplomas" cannot be bought, converged by government officials and rights defenders.
So far, authorities can promise immigrant workers that they could not have successfully spent the examination for the first time to study the basic language course.
In addition, immigrants who do not speak Russian will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is fairly low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government's reaction to recent incidents: Shooting during wedding celebrations where luckily there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by the Moscovita lawyer Dimitri Vinográdov, in which Apretar seven people lost their lives.
The police want to prohibit the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining licences for carrying weapons, from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Combating Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the reforms to the law on possession of weapons will be taken to the Duma of the State in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the "hard-hand policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "unsound rigority" be desisted.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, BBC of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov commented.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, 142 offences with the use of firearms registered in internal organs were committed for six months of 2012, compared with a total of 1168 offences registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are sure that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to go to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
In the meantime, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factory to official
The black arms market is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts arms orders
The first, "vestigio del ejército o militar", that is, the weapons that were stolen during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the same Caucasians," says Baranets.
The following type of "black weapon", stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons are sold from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
"There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover the fault," says an ex-military.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their granite of sand.
"Now private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market have proliferated and distribute weapons under rope to the black market, including that of Moscow," says the expert.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There they have their own production, sometimes handicrafted, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons," explains the former military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate participation of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this subject was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose theme is around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and the security forces.
Half of the weapons in the black market have come there "for the sake of officials whose work is related to weapons," says the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5 per cent correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The depending on one of the arms stores, which asked for their surname not to be mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been purchased by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through some alderez, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
"This carries the gun to the city and sells it at 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
"But, of course, the police are aware of all matters, so periodically, when the crime discovery plan has to be implemented, they purchase evidence from illegal arms dealers," he adds.
"As in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are often found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed me to go to the "Begovaya" platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "squinita" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there."
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts," says the storeman. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there too, let's say "from Mr. Ivanovih, who asked to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel paddles through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to betray him.
The newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tested himself on the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when an article on this subject was being published.
The schemes, according to their words, have not changed.
He was given an album of photos where there was no "everything".
"I felt like in a luxury boutique," the military recalls.
The buyer, according to Baranets' words, does not offer cat per hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential client, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the chance to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofa store
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where you offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No personal documents or encounters are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the title of the ad ad "Buy a gun or a machine gun".
There users make their orders and ask questions.
And they sell minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Ivan" (conserved spelling).
"I buy TT. Moscow gun," laconically asks his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at two hands those who want to buy firearms.
And the people go, as a hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia.
military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make the orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions for you to know where the weapon is hidden," says the press secretary of the NGO "The Right to Weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online order is made, one is left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures at two hands those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like a hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can be spent from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for $100-300.
A month and a half should be expected.
It's sent from the military warehouses by the mid-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared with the January-October 2011 period, the total number of such crimes in Russia decreased by 7 per cent, representing 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8 per cent.
The employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as ATMs in "McDonald's"
In recent days, a wave of protests against the low wages paid in the Walmart Corporation supermarkets and in restaurants in popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will arrive at the nine points, or whether it is intended to lose strength and sunset in its early stages.
Protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in the modest wages earned by Walmart workers and those in the fast food system, the aim of protest organizers is to create workers' unions in these companies.
For the time being, this sector of the economy has virtually not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday." That day, in the United States, it co-opened the orgy of discounts that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers of the Walmart corporation, who employs 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside the trade unions and left-wing activists in the corporation's shops, whose products are aimed at people of modest and moderate income.
Walmart sells everything, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries, to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in the larger supermarkets.
That's why many unpaid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of America's largest corporations.
According to two critical words, Walmart can afford to sell products at a very low price, partly because he pays little to his workers.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as lack of mount loads or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" the participants of the demonstration demanded an increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 per month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who receives $9.5 per hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
California University scientists at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average wage to $12 per hour, this will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than it spends on wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase on the consumer's shoulders, each visit to the store will be only 46 cents more expensive.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say satisfied that the protest took place only in nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
The "Black Friday" was extended in its shops from 8:00 p.m. to midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5000 items per second.
In total, their registers carried out "Black Friday" almost 100 million transactions.
The company's representative, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview to the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they left Walmart's "less than five" employees' job and that the protest had only been "another public relations trick", organized by the workers' union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not precisely the large Walmart stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and that is why there is no one for now), but the "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he sells billions of portions, and then they don't even grant you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest job!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 per hour in New York.
Nobody wins less than they in this city.
How it's possible to survive in New York with that money, it's incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers passed through the McDonald's and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, although they still lived with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble into some interviews with McDonald's workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum in the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if he does not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 in the morning of Thursday at McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the ATMs and fast-food cooks be paid at least $15 per hour, that is, that their current minimum wage be doubled.
They also demanded that workers' unions be created in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing trade union activists with arguments and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely facilitates their lives.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for trade unions to cover the fast food sector.
One of the main issues is over- rotation of staff.
Discordant
Sound protests took place on the same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at the McDonald's located near Times Square, in which several local Democrat politicians participated, in particular the member of the Jumaane Williams City Municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's says he's selling billions of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, for example Bill de Blasio's city mayor's candidate, who said that "we must support fast food workers to get fair wages and the economic prosperity that each New Yorker deserves."
As described by the New York Times, this has been the greatest manifestation of this type in the American history of fast food.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, even not all of them were employees of the fast food service, where tens of thousands of people from New York were trabakaned.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, cheating on the brain isn't that easy"
The theme of increased reality, so popular among the fans of modern technologies, is recently perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
At the beginning of the summer, at its annual conference Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also submitted an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at the Cambridge Microsoft lab, Izadi Sharamom, it was found that for the scientists of that company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted to the perspective of the manipulation of virtual objects in the air with bare hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the subject of your research group's study?
- We devote ourselves to personal-order interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been caught in the working stage with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as all are interested in gesture control.
- What else is the future for us?
- Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We're trying to change this, we work on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design systems.
The world must be freed from computers to ours, to the physicist, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, fuck with those stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you cannot be considered a panacea, you are pending to resolve the issue of privacy, as you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of computer interaction are good, but each in their own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not loose, but shorter movements.
In addition, gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a bracelet watch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this soda can?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I just talk.
- Oh, that's going to be very hard to recognize.
- I mean, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good in-depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you complain about modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the issue is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From the latter point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
I mean, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
The speed, the number of tables per second, is also important.
Human movements are quite dynamic and current 30 fps are truly scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Batiche, from our Redmond lab, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing retard from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that modern serial-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands to what extent this affects man-machine interaction.
It would be very useful to me for my work to have an equivalent of such a device, but it does not require contact for the tables per second to be more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared beam emitter and the second the reflected signal receiver.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible diapason sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the camera location curve and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, hasn't presented his glasses to the public.
Doesn't it seem to you that, from the point of view of the daily use of enhanced reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could move from the glasses to the smart phone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is your strength (the private things only you can see), but also your weakness: an increased reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the "Iron Man" movie, but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile response!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
- In my lectures I often say that the increased reality is the seventh break in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as an image support.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays aimed at a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar feeling to that one feels if someone is blowing it in the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve ends of the fingers, this also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to deceive the brain?
To make him think he feels what it looks like he should feel when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried yet.
Here we hide another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believes that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, cheating on the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That's what makes work attractive with virtual reality for researchers, which many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal pleasure instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, to the vanguard of art and culture.
On this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from the top down, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or in fashion meetings and openings.
Kirill Miller's paintings always attract crowds, wherever they show up.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophies of St. Petersburg, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg's avant-garde in the late 80s - early 1990s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance in the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took into his hands an organillo and became the organillery of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, because of his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going through the city dressed in red and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I'm a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the red color is a commitment between the artist, the image makers and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little bit grey raises aggressiveness and agitation of nothing good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- When did you realize you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my work was exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official artists had ended, and the new, free like me, were still incomprehensible.
I became a friend of new wave artists, with the post-exposure artists in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not the lyrics.
It was important to me to meet at the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds should be gathered.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical art club, a bohemian club, the house of the bohemian of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under phonogram, wore tight pants, including the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before Hali-galivskih's time.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and assiduous clients.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was made in the press, the prize was "The People of Our City".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so my culmination ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognizable in your jobs.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in which the current and the occurrence is clearly expressed.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being like this is painful and terrifying.
But in the clowns everything is embodied and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and mandatory change in clothing.
Now they follow one by clothes, orienting himself into the outside, but not inside the person.
And, perhaps, that person should not be given his hand, but spit on his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
We just saw you on the role of an urban organillery.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before people grouped in herds, bohemians wanted one thing, the simplons others.
Now they've all been divided into microcommunities, it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a $100 ticket to like everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov come for thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes away.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to spoil what you've accomplished.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end up.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, that's another story.
I am a man of yesterday's culture, I grew up under the example of artists living in poverty and dying in poverty, they refused money only to paint paintings.
I am in favour of this culture.
- Kirill, what's St. Petersburg missing?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can devote themselves to culture.
When the kings were the right ones everything was otherwise, the kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because experts at a higher level are needed to properly evaluate them and open their way.
The subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same thing, Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is it for you St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is terrain.
But on our stones it's hard for art to grow.
We need cultural terrain and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people going to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is incomplete.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Give birth in space
Earth is in danger.
Global warming or crash with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board leave in search of a spare planet.
To conserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of ingratitude or on the same replacement planet?
I think there's little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the head researcher of the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on Venus surface the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at great altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Reproduction problems in space with flora began to be addressed.
Since half a century ago, plant experiments have been carried out.
Four generations of peas cultivated in orbit did not differ in any of the terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in the orbit, small flies of the fruit, the drosophiles.
In 1979, cucumber eggs were sent to the space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of ungraveness.
We get a normal chick as a result.
But then the problems begin.
"The problem is that this chick has to find support, he must stay on his own feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
In the absence of support, the chicks gave random voltages.
And after 10 hours in newborns, there was a total atrophy of the instincts.
Chickens didn't react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they just died.
"And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev on failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological "miniarch" flew into the orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" only species of the same sex will travel.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent to space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had descent.
However, the problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been addressed.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot perform their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years now.
The biggest risk was Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing humanity has is the feminine organism.
Our gut flying, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a flight to space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
"After all, no one has answered this question," says the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flight to space, the first cosmonauta woman, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonauta.
In 1988, the second cosmonauta woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in the open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even on orbital flights," sums up the cosmonauta pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must look for some new pathways in biotechnology, in radiation protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the cosmonauta preparation centre is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
Under zero float conditions, cosmonautas practice their work skills in space.
The water simulates the ingravity.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child is its native element.
Small-afib men seem to confirm that life on earth emerged from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months within his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
"This is too little to forget," says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary to gravitate, the force of gravity.
Abdominal and pelvis muscles are decreasing very quickly, the ability to expel the foetus is reduced.
Well, we omitted that, trusting in the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push it.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special training suit, like adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
"And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to the bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally inappropriate person," provides the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when human beings on their ships are directed to a distant planet that will be the home for their children born in space.
Head of NKÚ: The inspection of the "švarc" system has not given the guilty politician
In the area of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its application lies.
This is what Miloslav Kala, vice president of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ) says in an interview for Aktuálnę.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
The joint controls of the Czech and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Nečas' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "švarc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civic Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls or require obligations," Kala says.
At the meeting of the Control Committee at the Congress of the Members, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech team and the German team, in which the legislation relating to public procurement was compared in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel control that we started doing about two years ago.
Simplifiedly said: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then praxis itself.
We have united everything and, although control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is " stricter and more complete", however, concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more and more stringent rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think the conclusions are?
Precisely such a common control could help us to stop investing efforts in the realization of laws, the reduction and improvement of limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of savings means getting something right at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by the fact that we reduce the limit of awards means that we are going to achieve it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much "paperwork", that those who want to look for faults in the system will be able to do it more easily than if the limits were kept as high as now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation governing the practice of public procurement.
How does the system of controls work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NKÚ or is it organized otherwise?
How much the offices, such as NKÚ, operate there the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Accounts), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in their case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve parallel.
The competences are also to a certain extent analytical, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level. In this regard it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, which we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data. However, Germany remains a model in some respects, but it cannot be specified exactly where it is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of the inspectors?
I'm sure not, but, I repeat, I don't like to make such comparisons.
It must be said that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it wasn't, it wouldn't be any benefit for you to work with our office, would it?
With regard to our country's legislation, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean to your Office? Is its incidence manifested in any way?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been stated in the control procedures.
Since we carry out ex post checks, there is a certain delay.
For now, it is noted in the process of preparing for future controls: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public awards, which have been analysed.The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of the selection process and similar.
Do you think that the adoption of this law is beneficial, or rather an embezzlement to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is surely a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, controlled persons were linked to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and each law that was not respected in the area of public procurement meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal failure, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We'll see where this path starts.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS would not bother employers with controls of the so-called švarc system, with reference to being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the švarc system forbidden or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits anything, then even the Prime Minister of the Government cannot prevent the Office from acting that has an obligation to carry out such controls and to require obligations.
He can say, "We change the law and allow it," but he can't say that we'll do like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the regulation is rather strict as to how it should be formally acted, and that is how it should be in order to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic to exclude the candidate with the best offer for failing to meet the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. This is, in my opinion, what we lack.
The roads have ice plates, although most of them are transitable
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads have ice plates and snow plates.
Although most of the routes are transitable, caution should be exercised in some cases.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature descends and will range between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
In contrast, on the crests of the Metallic Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places the visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the road control centre in the region.
The fast road R6 and the first-class road in the region are now transitable without restrictions.
However, caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All roads in the second and third categories, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still tracts with ice remains and pierced snow.
There is a need to increase road attention, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a snow layer may have been formed on the roads, reports the Road and Highway Directorate on their pages.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice plates being formed, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice cream can be produced in the vicinity of Lanškrouna, Ustí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially in the second and third categories of roads.
I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads from the mountains of Krkonoše to Orlické hory.
There is a snow layer piled in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Knžnou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, the sky will be today between clear and partially cloudy, without precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three under zero and a positive degree, blowing a weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable this morning, although caution should be extremely high and it will be necessary to adapt to time.
In the first hours of the morning there will be freezing, temperatures will range between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent temperature decline, some pathways could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will find fog, but visibility will progressively improve.
This is the result of information from the road control centre in the region.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although caution is recommended, especially on the road between 80 and 131 km.
The surface of most first-class roads is dry and without ice.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road border with Germany there may be stretches with ice plates.
The second and third-category tracks are wet, so, in this case, we also notice stages with ice plates.
Drivers should be more prudent, especially on the less transited roads in the Šumava area.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will find partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow left in the port of Červenohorské and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Road operators took away the snow during the night; on the Šumper road, about three centimeters of snow, according to the road managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the Šumper road, snow remains.
Drivers in the port of Červenohorské will find half-dry snow in the direction of Jeseník," a road manager from Šumper to ČTK confirmed today.
On the ground and at night, his colleagues also came to Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the road of Olomouc the roads are transitable without restrictions, in that of Šternberská drivers should drive with caution in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of Ustí nad Labem and region of Liberec
North Bohemia road operators have reported complications in different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or ice cream, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice in the region of Ustí nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures remain low, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road. Instead, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No complications of service have been reported for the mmento.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of Štętí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced from the general roads on road I/13, at the border between the region of Ustí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of snow.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the world will come to an end, what do you think about it?
It's just one of so many other alarming news that we like to grab.
The music group The Tap Tap rather likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a truly original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain to our readers?
This is a state charity act we've been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 in the morning.
The previous day, on December 20 at 21 hours, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at approximately the same time as the Maya calendar ends on Kiribati Island, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who did this idea come up with?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Maya calendar we have also created a unique collection of articles: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keyboards against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The Tap Tap group, along with other interpreters, also sang the so-called hymn against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is now very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at charities?
Of course it will, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
All interpreters will sing it at the same time at the three concerts.
The hymns will link together simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the lyrics of this song and plays the leading role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration arise?
We work together even with other figures from the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charities and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
Most of them have been shown to be interested and have fun working with us.
What will the money raised at the concerts against the end of the world be for?
To equipment for the educational center without barriers Studieo, which we have completed in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedličkęv ústav.
Students at the Jedličkęv ústav school regularly receive a visit from teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we are making efforts to make it possible.
In the context of the completion of the works in Jedličkęv ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
A number of groups and interpreters perform at each concert.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a programme that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiří Suchý will act.
For more detailed information, see www.kpks.cz.
Do you have any other similar "dramatic action" planned in the future?
In May we will act for the first time at the Pražské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and me, personally, taking advantage of that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group of persons with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It's not as difficult as it may seem at first sight.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also bear a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. ČSA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which keeps me surprised.
Even in Moscow, where we have recently returned, everything came out smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you met so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have witnessed that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, there it is still uncommon that a person moves alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, giving preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established that strives to theme the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what respect should we take an example of more developed countries?
There's a lot of things we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people directly affected.
In London and Madrid it is very normal that people with a serious disability move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want to...
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to participate in social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap let's go a little ahead!
A society respectful or without barriers is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will start to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great will force.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look a few years ago, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator in Jedličkęv ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I'm a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Laja Angelovič says, we got a little out of hand (laughter).
However, popularity did not come until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that it helped us quite well to connect with famous singers and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it did not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's assistance, we can also afford to be a teacher of quality, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something differently.
The world of the show is full of things that resemble each other.
It is logical, in its way, that all new things are welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept themselves.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it's a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, with the condition, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it's not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did you help the fact that you're a demanding boss, as many people describe you?
If we want to do a quality job, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they find out they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
Currently, The Tap Tap Group has twenty members.
How many of them were already in the beginning of 1998?
Only one: Laáa Angelovič.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Whoever has will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda de Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic
The three cities will be connected at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the band The Tap Tap "End of the World, cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the resources necessary to finance multifunctional equipment from the STUDEO school without barriers in Jedličkęv ústav of Prague, costing 25 million Czech kronas.
The entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry in the pre-sale option in Bohemianticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency last week Poland was accepted as twelfth member of the ESA. It is the second member country of the ESA of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland initiated an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and in subsequent years participated in the agency's project commission.
However, Poland's path to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in flights to space before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. Šternfeld at the astronomical observatory in Warsaw, in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indifferent assistants and, years later, Šternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won in France the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch prize for his "Introduction to cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, he was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he put his name on one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in 1925 a dresine was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the outlines of the project are not known either.
It is not clear whether the rocket was to be used for the start of the dresin or for its braking.
The information about this dyresin is limited to the press collection of the time.
From 1933 onwards, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustawem Mokrzyckiegim.
On the basis of the material preserved, it becomes clear that the investigation reached the stage of practical evidence.
However, with the arrival of the German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by engineer Rohoziński appeared in the specialized press and the following year was published the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza", by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Interim Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all project missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the beginning of the war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The November 1954 edition of Problemy magazine refers for the first time to society with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowicze, he proposed the creation of a society that would be dedicated to cosmonautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to become part of the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He held this charge until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM probe rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 the two-step RM-2 rocket air tests began in the Błędów desert.
The rocket was 1,4 meters and weighed about 11,5 kg.
Another type of developing rocket was going to be the subject of real scientific study. RM-34 rocket was going to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
However, work was suspended in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the 1962s and 1965s.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were differentiated by the space available for scientific devices.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the space available for the volume was 0.4 litres, in the Meteor-1B of 0.34 litres and in the Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The peak in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first air tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful weight of 10 kg up to 60 km high.
Subsequently, Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland's entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
Within the framework of the Interkosmos programme, Poland joined the cosmic space research on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonauta after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional court suspended the law of social labour.
The resolution aroused a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the problem from a broader perspective.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulatory.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with unbridled financial speculation.
The impact of large differences on labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and thus "provokes a fall" in the competitor's price with the aim of making the most of the market and thus increasing its profit margin.
On a large scale it means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing.The result is high unemployment in those countries where the labour price, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, by doing so, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social spending of the state necessarily increases.
This whole situation is conducive to the total disinterest of employers in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their efforts to obtain benefits.
The situation is universally so well known that no specific statistical data is required.
Unscrupulous private capital practices create situations, in certain economies, in which the Governments of these countries are forced to compete with the objective of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, Governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is evident above all in the changes in existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictation of private capital, especially in terms of wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees to work rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increased gaps between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points for poor people in Germany that cannot be maintained with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a rather frequent case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The savings measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to migrate with a bad wage on the edge of society, hoping that someday they will reach the private capital investor country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty moves from one country to another or never arrives, as Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turkish, Moroccan, Egyptian or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media affirm even the satiety that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which leads to the economy's failure.
The private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by intruding in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its selfishness in political progress and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and omnipresent, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the field of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprobable everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, are responsible for drafting bills to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of bill is then passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are quickly in a situation like that described by the Appians in their work The crisis of the Roman Republic in the times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for a long time and the administrations were dealing with force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and helps to finance stones or swords.
Bribery and corruption spread unhinderedly and people went to the polls with the vow beforehand."... "There were no people in character who aspired to a post in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "He began to speak seriously that the only remedy for such a serious situation was autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man"... Although Appians thought of Pompeii, Caesar went up to power and transformed democracy forever into autocracy.
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that the current company is based on disregarded preferences of the individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
Private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decay of the elite, without an effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the boom of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes that we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
Suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both at international and within the EU level, the Czech Government will be forced to continue to look for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The solution goes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in the government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the lab of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could" (Nothing comes from violence and nothing could do so), Sting in his Fragile song and whose strife says "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (Let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the last waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One side of Israel argues in favour of the right of self-defence and encloses Palestinians in the role of terrorists, the other side supports Palestinians and claims racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and strikes Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is guilty of the repeated massacres and who is the victim. After all, today's citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the curtain, a look to discover who takes advantage of the tensions that have been dragged for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, on who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of humanity the history of the struggles for power is in the forefront.
At every time we can find a Great Alexander or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether these characters were always leading their steps autonomously or whether someone behind their throne was orienting their actions towards a certain objective.
We must accept that we live in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been able to reach in one generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't discard it): the Rothschilds.
It's not written much near them.
Naturally.
In the nineties of the nineteenth century they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost all the central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, declared, or are preparing for a war: before the attack on Afghanistan they were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq they were 5, after overthrowing Gadafi there were only four left, but in the meantime Russia has subjected the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the central bank Bank of America of the Rothschild, began during the Secession War to print money and was killed in 1865 in the theatre.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the federal reserve system (FED) and was killed in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for having triggered the big economic crisis of 1929.
Their desire for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchic states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially in Britain; the third was intended to reduce the population of the land between half a billion and a billion people (similar number of slaves for their well-being and luxury would suffice and not consume so many resources); in addition to the creation of a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing but a preliminary draft for such a solution) and the definitive adoption of absolute powers.
The method with which the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschilds, operates follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order abchao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and they always lead to worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the EDF was created so that a crisis like that of the year 1907 was not repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Australian-Hungarian throne, Francisco Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after the First World War was triggered as a result, they destroyed the Zarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian empire.
To prepare the ground for World War II, they allowed bankers and politicians to create, in a covert manner, a conflicting situation as a result of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses. Later, they were enough to serve the Germans the solution of the Führer, which was strong and simple enough and pointed to the guilty, and then to build a Czechoslovakia composed of several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to represent and represented so well the role of the fifth column, which lit the flame and triggered the outbreak of the war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds encouraged the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above laid the foundations for the massive immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were taking place on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope that the international bankers had tied to at first or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus for a third war was created.
If international bankers were to get it started, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a first-line victim, now along with the Arab or, generally, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding and chaos machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also at international level. Let us take as an example how Israel's sympathizers and detractors are strongly divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where injustice engenders injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of all was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its officials, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
Israel's current president B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to international bankers, who does all he can to declare war on Iran and, considering Iran as a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, bearing in mind that Iran controls the Ormuz Strait, where it passes 20% of all world oil (the navigation corridor has only two miles wide), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under what light are now shown the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will agree with a new world order."
The new world order in its imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of well-balanced financial aristocracy.
A world in which every new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls all his being.
"And it compels all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, to have a mark on the right hand or on the forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in the front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six."
Film Argo: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of the demonstration of Islamist students occupied the American embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats as hostages.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned shah Mohamed Réza Páhlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation did not offer any positive prospects: throwing the shah overboard could not be allowed, since, if it did, endangered the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified even more with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government's negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., its fate caused a wave of solidarity and animation against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in front of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film "Argo" by the director and actor Ben Affleck theme an episode of this story, which saw a little success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, helping a covert story: they went out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team that examined localization in the country for filming a superproduction of science fiction.
Combination of genders
The plan that the "exfiltration" expert drew from Toni Mendez required Hollywood's collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized journals, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from Tony Mendez's memories.
Affleck's film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the moods. We find well documented sequences of Tehran on one side. The credit sequence shows emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were reflected in the same way in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes slightly lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And besides, scenes at the CIA headquarters and other institutions: men dressed to analyze the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adiós, Adiós" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where it was raised.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of ancient films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck proves it in Argo, where Tehran "wheels" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy's taking is impressive because of its synoptic capacity which, at the same time, transmits the emotion of confusion and the lack of prediction that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators have a similar effect on the fictitious scenes (the impostor team in the Tehran bazar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematographic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
And he manages quite well. Sometimes he adds something to reality: here everything doesn't come out so elegantly (the scene that stalks the crisis at Tehran airport, the deviation of a call to America and the unbridled search behind his track become a madness).
Argo's weakness is the discontrol that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of a dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller evoking the 1970s.
But if it collapses, that'll be hard.
As an evocation of a real history and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is sufficient.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually presents a survey of the most absurd banking fees, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulation or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a share of 40 percent of women in leadership positions in large European companies," said Právo Patrik Nacher, the poll organizer.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women benefited from better prices in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013," Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the shady guideline the size of the chicken cages, which has contributed to the significant increase in egg prices this year.
The factual ban on the use of the term "untating jar" or the removal of the classic bulb from the shops has been criticized.
A quality banana must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union apparatus often takes such decisions under pressure from one or the other commercial or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that high-quality bananas should have a length of at least 14 centimeters in the EU and could not present " abnormal curves".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that this is only aimed at harmonising the national standards that have not been homogenized so far, which only complicated their marketing.
The rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive involves a waste of edible food.
The candidate to win the survey could be the EU's last year's prescription that in the inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under 8 years of age are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The US referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of child death due to asphyxiation.
There is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of massacres by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious events are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation concerning European officials: anyone who has an official role in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. To avoid hurting Greece's sensitivity, talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
Server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union's prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a Member State.
The EU determined the maximum quantities of food supplies that can be found in the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day as we entered the EU.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the volume established for conserved mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fine.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application for grants.
Such ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
"We're at a disadvantage because we don't have sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said then Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that there was a lot of cereal produced in our country and, as a result of so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to be exported.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was prepared to assist the Czech Republic and organized a public competition for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development led by Minister Pavel Nęmec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of applications for grants from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often the target of criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the recovery of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also concerned with sensitive fiber, as are other countries of the Union, with the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious of these disputes.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of Olomouc's requisition, but had to change the name to national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and became called "tuzemak".
Only products made from sugar cane distillation can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the known feta and gorgonzola cheeses around the world, the mazapan of the German city Lübeck or Parma ham, are already found, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Pohořelice and Třebo y, even, the variety of hops of Žatec.
As protected maras from the EU, you can be proud of Pardubice's ginger bread and the boats of Hořice v Podkrkonoší.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how did you come up with the president's election?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If everything was right in our country, then I wouldn't present my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves become unpunished, taxes increase and retirement age.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I try to give a solution to change it.
And since I'm already 40 and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to introduce myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly thereafter it has set its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for it?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
Later I specified that if I were to go out as a senator, I would present my candidacy to the presidency.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not just that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of television, but that we trample anyone who wants to start a change.
This is added to the media, which depreciate and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or been adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial thesis and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership over 20 million.
To that end, the law must be changed.
As president, it does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guideship to be recognized as self-employed, and we did so.
The problem lies in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, whether right or left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to obtain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without matching or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and apply it.
Are you considered a man on the right or on the left?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What I care about is that we move on.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from KSČM or the SDG and, likewise, I will be against bad ideas.
He's kidding when he says he's populist.
But you're not proving it with what you say?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I speak of already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without Parliament's support, there are only slogans left.
And with this he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will, for example, get criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to get it.
If he were elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors of the state.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong character who points to the disputes, pressure can be put on the political scene.
Let us take on a case-by-case basis the direct election of the President, who has been a achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started in politics and I'm trying to get as much support as I can for my program.
I'm trying to get things through myself, but in case it doesn't go well, in six years I'll leave it and go back to the private sector.
Sounds like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to present their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work to do.
For my part, I have at least supported research journalist Jana Lorencová, who brought to light frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself from the base that people are really unsatisfied, now I'm on the balance.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did so voted for the representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two from the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so that it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven't considered it yet because I don't have time for it, to check the untachiable past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I don't have money for the presidential campaign, there's only 20,000 crowns in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's his?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another floor valued at eight million, a collection of artworks valued at ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who was driving this car, was galante with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and you don't have money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your part.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to indebted myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows that there is not too much interest in my programme.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
Expenditure for the campaign covers essentially what I will receive as a senator's salary.
But I couldn't live with it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which costs 30,000 kronor a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn't present myself as a candidate.
So you'll continue your business activity so you can live?
Haven't you said before that I was going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I have promised, I have partly left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my substitute in spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I was president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the recently completed "book Mountain" - 2 photos
"I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and at last there's something interesting to see," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by who passes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technician in a large company located near the library, points out: "In addition, the building is beautiful."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have Internet, tablets and electronic books.
No one gets into those old-fashioned libraries by taste, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom town located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a leaking visit, has the doubtful honor of having lifted up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 people has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counter this embarrassing situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and to copy the seven fictitious bridges represented on euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of armed concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that's how the political leaders decided that there was only one possibility to improve statistics: there was a library to be built!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings to the pair that cynical, took the theme with his usual serenity and appeared to the presentation of the contest in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrouded his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the EUR 30 million mountain rises at the planned location.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of housing and townhouse buildings.
In early November the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small city without history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white façade one would rather intuite a dairy center, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The long way to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a quest.
Well it is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to melt with their topography at every step from their climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is luminous and easy to cover with the view, the brick floor collected and the elegant lamps unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
Upon view you can see the park banks, dogs and boys and girls playing soccer.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
"Normally the book shelves are arranged along the façade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," Winy Maas says.
What we have done is to put the classic spatial configuration upside down and remove the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserves the black shelves that assume the functions of wall coating, parapet and barandilla at the same time.
View, touch, and smell are strange.
Even architects and civil engineers more a day shake their heads when they hear of this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials," explains Joop Trouborst, project leader in the city of Spijkenisse.
And that's how one day, in a friesy farm, we encounter the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of few millimeters of thickness is used as a basis for sustaining the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and then is discarded.
For the library, this fabric was worn, for the first time in such quantities, up to four centimeters thick plates.
With heat and pressure, so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a mixture of new car and sports slipper.
After 105 feet you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy some tasty Dutch croquettes and its ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment that maintains atmospheric moisture suitable for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a New Soul
"Although it is difficult to believe it given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling are obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even in the sunny days the sun shines only for a few hours inside it.
The huge wooden fences located in a cross-cutting direction to the crystal facade serve to give shadow and absorb most of the sun's rays.
This creates a comfortable interior climate.
The rest is the thing about automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptic worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to put his foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Similarly, Chinese traditional medicine teacher Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She calls "Boekenberg" as Spijkenisse's "late soul".
The reason is that, on the occasion of the opening that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; it currently has 70,000 copies.
The concept has deepened.
The shelves are full.
"There's nothing worse than a half empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I believe that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of the library.
Even if I'm just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved a complete success in that discipline that reigns that in the specialized argot is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and insecure it may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more leading role"
Germany has abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert in US-Europe relations, this places Berlin in a rather dangerous diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany suggested that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship between the country and Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time I believe that it does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it concerned the establishment of a flight ban zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because it is currently reorienting its foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they're still tapping their role, but they've already started the way to a "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy specifically mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of other great powers, and that is why Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
That is why it must be careful and not alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I would not give it that much importance, since it is not a completely unilateral relationship.
However, they play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think that there has been such a drastic break-up as in the case of Libya.
This may have enabled Germany to gain some respect.
After all, all this has only been done to demonstrate that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
On the other hand, the US has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a disparity of views between the US and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. internal policy.
I believe that the Obama government secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the real disparity of opinion does not really have the scale attributed to it.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about his policy.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that's exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility to be part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing with the euro now.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a dangerous subject.
But I believe that the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to play a leading role?
Or maybe it's still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to find it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany stands as the main actor, certain anti-Anti-German feelings are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
It is an old problem and it is that no one wants to be surrounded by the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbours and opinions, and that is not easy.
The US's influence on European policy is increasingly diminishing, but the EU does not cover that gap for the time being, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more leading role.
Even if they don't like it, if it's unpleasant to them or if it makes them even more unpopular, c'est la vie!

"Protection of brands" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-famous brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
But what is Armani Polo?
After this name is hidden a officially registered name in China but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
"Foreigns find it increasingly difficult to protect their brands in China," says Thomas Pattloch, lawyer of the Taylor Wessing firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
A new case comes to my table every week.
The imitators simply add a couple of letters so they can register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens a archiver where he keeps seats from the Beijing brand office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also served from the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the large cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeitings.
However, Pattloch's cases are of another kind. On behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the brand office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
which refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's harmful to the business, we have to fight it," Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes water, the monopoly position disappears and the damage the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the sectors concerned are millions, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the CLSA market analysis company, with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year, China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the most rapidly growing market.
However, annulment of dubious legality registrations in brand registration is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
Processes can be extended up to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court dismissed a complaint because it had been so long that the name subject to the complaint had already become a "market reality".
"If the plaintiff is bad luck, he may even have to pay money to the plaguer because the process has damaged his brand in China," says Pattloch.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a litigation against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
The buyer of Volvo, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the case was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste clothing manufacturer lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the employment emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims processes has been reduced by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75 per cent more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims remain pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, CTMO registered more than 1.4 million brand protection applications, nearly one third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
This also appears to occur with the number of valid logos, a figure of 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1,8 billion yuans would have been embedded in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuans or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in the courts against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and Delegate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also rejected the appeal of the muniques.
In the following two instances they have given Freudenberg the reason, but the opposite side continues to fight at present.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where it is still pending.
Wentzler hopes to be able to resolve the issue favourably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time."
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite side a "six-digit sum in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it did not succeed.
"This shows how much we care about," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
in particular if the imitators are guaranteed there the rights to unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and skin products.
The group has long left this commercial area, however it has been able to prevent registration.
"We have to be very careful," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent in doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register in China all that can be protected," as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can be much more expensive than a simple record.
In fact, in case Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposite license rights for his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would expel us from the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg he rehearses the Imbongi choir and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans are happy
The history of a link capable of surpassing a lot more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and mocasines look for the compass on the parquet floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bajo, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, hindering and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to get out of his boxes by trying to put order with his strong and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, between 23 and 69 years old, have also arrived from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and also in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate of UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, around 34 million people worldwide are infected with HIV.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 AIDS orphans.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany godfathers for the 180 AIDS orphans of the people of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school enrolment, uniform and ensure a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in zulú "story scratcher" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but singing does.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: southern Africa.
8.733 kilometers from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice which has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40 per cent of the inhabitants of Swaziland are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with more than thirty years has become something common.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this small population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but also the main: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than limited.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the "Voices for Africa" association that has since professionally taken care of AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Acts on Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Among bacterial STDs are syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Shrimps and scaffolds are found between STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are most often given in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of five cases of syphilis registered in Germany originate in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, tricomon infections, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (hongo) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20 per cent of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, clamid infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled its number from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has maintained a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were recorded in 2011.
This is a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that this is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms, and that is why they are not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not provide protection to one hundred percent.
Some pathogenic agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt infections and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regular medical examinations, especially if a sexual partner is frequently changed.
If they are diagnosed early, most STDs can be healed and it is possible to avoid any late consequences.
Through collaborations, donations and, finally, but not less importantly, the choir's fees for their actions across Germany come to raise enough money.
"In total we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says proudly Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the town of Zodwa Dlamini itself, a woman with self-safe and leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
It ensures that orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "goods", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care that children go to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, receives a wage from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has launched a sewing school, built two hens and, in collaboration with the US health organization PSI, has managed to have many of the people undergo a HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite the fact that this disease is manifest throughout the country, it is often not openly spoken of.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This formally accepted form of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel the country from one side to the other and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any corner you can get free condoms, but these are barely used.
It's another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact."
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years in southern Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and trust in the black race, songs that many at the southernmost end of the African continent still remember of the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language; both recognition not only brings an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear off a couple of tears from someone other than another rabid border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the river Ezulweni is well known.
"Get close to Esitjeni, there the light shines," says the people of the place.
And after travelling the 8.733 kilometers straight-line back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms of Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shine from there.
Messenger: NASA Discovers Ice in Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
The ice layer probably has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice in Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also iced water, as is evident from three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has been formed in the area of the planet permanently in the shadow.
It looks like it's at least 30 centimeters and probably even 20 meters thick.
The water is presumably derived from comets or, with great probability, asteroids that were hit by Mercury on their day.
No one relates the finding of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, says the Chief Researcher of the Messenger Probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees centigrade.
However, findings could help to clarify how water and other life components have come to other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of the planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, besides the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which turns around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue points, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "reborn" stars.
This region of star formation, unromanticly called by scientists W5, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This twisted image of an extinction star was taken by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifide Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star formation area.
The Pléyades, a group of stars also known as the nickname of "The Seven Sisters", are a visible object with simple view in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helice Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
His similarity to a earthly continent has validated the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular colorful.
This star in clays could be captured in all its splendor for the first time by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It's probably a remnant of one of Saturn's moons that disappeared without leaving a trace 4,5 billion years ago.

Depending on the tonalities, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Triphide Nebula located several thousands of light years in the constellation of Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the burning heart of this area of star formation into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco the astronomers were able to photograph the signs of a cosmic carambola: 400 million light years from the Earth the nucleus of two galaxies in the fusion process staggered each other to end up crashing irremediably.
This formation of stars was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may refer to it with the nickname of Southern Molinillo.
The photograph of the Hubble space telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the Cepheus constellation.
The nebula located at 1,400 light years is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and a hundred times smaller than that of dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays made by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served for a model moment for NASA's Hubble space telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest young star group in our Milky Way.
This area of star formation constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Roseta Nebula, there are also continuously new stars; 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this brilliant galaxy with a small black hole there's still no dust, just gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found above all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer are increasingly deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the image, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the U.S., the Large Binocular Telescope rises.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Grand Canary Telescope located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
South African Large Telescope mirror in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of this most economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its particularity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of Arecibo's radio telescope (Puerto Rico) researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) you can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors his name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will cover 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007 the two Keck telescopes located in the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of huge proportions and with a mirror diameter of 30 meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information of the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has sent images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the space telescope Kepler has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are inhabitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations prior to the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched on board an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
Researchers depart from the base that in the southern pole of Mercury there is also ice.
However, there is no feasible evidence, as the Messenger probe turns around the planet in a much closer orbit to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice in Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists now have the certainty that it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years
To the south of Azerbaijan, many people manage to reach Bible ages.

To the south of Azerbaijan, many people manage to reach Bible ages.
There is even a museum dedicated to longevity.
A search for prints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great strep through the sinuous road that passes by forest hills, rivers of great flow and the simple houses of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here live the "talyshi", a village that is not known much, apart from that they dominate perfectly Persian and Azeri and that are very longevous.
Our final destiny is Lerik.
This small city boasts of an architecture perhaps too maciza designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit entirely in such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate both urban cores, it takes eight hours because the road is of one sense.
The amazing wealth of the country thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the Eurovision Festival and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the Oldest People in the World," says Fatulayeva.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis from the place they have over 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points to a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
A son of his died at the age of 136
However, the museum's indisputable star is the shepherd of the sheep, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And if we take into account that the documented older man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Müslümov is quite suspicious.
"He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children. Apparently he still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Have you been wrong then, Mr Muslümov, at his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the advanced age of this inhabitant in Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan there are also very old people," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age; maximum when there is no civil record either.
Every day glasses filled with melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do you live here, in the south, so many older people?
The Azeri tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that it is the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, instead believes that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the food rich in calories of Talyshi, who worship meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of which, in addition, drink a melted glass of butter daily, is so healthy.
Or maybe it's the natural way of life that keeps young people? In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At his 97 years he is relatively young for what he stands by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the ground, it tirelessly moves a huge butter bathtub.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of the children and one of Mirzayeva's daughter, both became grandparents long ago.
They also jump from one side to another two young children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that serves in typical glasses in an abject form.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long dark blond hair braids that her son discovers proudly.
I've always washed my hair with milk, that's why I've never fallen and kept its color.
"I have never used a shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I've never been shopping for a supermarket in my whole life.
Then he tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its channel when the "Dear Father," Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds weird in an older woman's mouth.
In Azerbaijan, however, the worship that is professed to the paternal figure of the nation, which leads his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave up the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) for monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's cowardly son is right: "In our culture the elders are very respected."
They live in a great family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't enough reason to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacked the term "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Manifestations that rival each other in Cairo reveal the tremendous division in which the country is immersed.
The future constitution, with sharia as the basis, is very controversial.
The Egyptian president did not escape in patheticism.
"We must overcome the transition.
And if that happens, it's my responsibility to the people and to God," he said on public television.
His speech was directed to the whole people, especially to the Christian Coptics, the Liberals, the illustrated Muslims and the seculars.
All of them, immersed so far in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, he has had to temporarily nullify the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a PhD degree awarded by the University of South California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
Indeed, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour night meeting, are truly worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
However, what does that mean of "principles"?
This was and continues to be open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manoeuvre it carries together, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article added suggests: in all matters relating to Sharia it is mandatory to consult the Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution in the country with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to be, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that - in fact - would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship these courts served to exercise harsh repression over the opposition.
Up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons after the fall of the dictator.
As the draft states, the State must "protect the true essence of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is such an inaccurate formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
Speaking clearly, it is nothing but censorship.
By the way, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
On the other hand, another prohibits offending or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it is to be punished.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits the "offense to people"
Is a caricature of the president enough or a joke about a lawyer?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been closing ranks in front of the superiority of Islamists for weeks.
Ten thousand people gathered in an unusual harmony on Friday afternoon at Tahrir del Cario Square and swore to fail the Minutes before it could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end up winning," says Hamdin Sabbahi, who occupies the third place on the lists for the presidential elections.
The Peace Nobel and former Director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, stated that the draft constitution should be "in the garbage bucket of history".
Through Twitter he accused the followers of Mursi of wanting to lead a "state coup against democracy".
"When the referendum is called, we will go to his palace and overthrow it," says Oppositor Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned," the opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to monitor the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifesto; in case not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, to the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it by shouting: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded that Mursi "clean the country", while proclaiming: "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where everything began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that the supporters of Mursi did not want to risk something like that happening.
Muslim brothers stated that both those opposed to the draft constitution and supporters of the constitution would have expressed their opinions high and clear.
Now it would have been time for the people to decide what direction the country should follow in the polls.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of Islamists is guaranteed by the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year lawyer specializing in human rights and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or had to face a trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," she regrets in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it," Saeda regrets.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester at Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster you cannot control."
The Norwegian rakfisk: The world's most nasty fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible for the country's success to have any relationship with its avidness for an extremely bad fish?
Take a series of overhealed cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet soccer clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You can then smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway's exquisites.
I meet in the little town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
It's snowy. The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is a trout in salt that is allowed to ferment in water during, depending on how badly you prefer it, up to a year.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians come in tropel to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this manjar of the most, so to speak, captivating.
"It eats raw and then drinks a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city fireman who is also known as the "General of the Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a large amount of drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than the rakfisk," Havard says.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it's not bad; it's not very different from a portion of sushi that's been a few kilometers by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty plagued Norway and in which, before cooling existed, fish was stored during the autumn submerged in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the winter, when it is already well fermented, it is removed and, obviously with the inactive senses due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Only one generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country for work, and they emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13 per cent are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a comprehensive system of social services.
A flow of people from Sweden, the old rival and even does not much richer than Norway, arrives in this country to work.
Rakfisk is considered to be an important part of the past of Norway, which is an essential part, although quite ill-sufficient.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer cane or a sandwich cost you the 10€ friolera ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the agenda of international news, and most Norwegians like it.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the extreme right-wing racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to shooting as "the July 22 event".
The Norwegians find it hard to believe that in their mild country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway's current wealth, since the early 1970s, one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has grown.
"But oil is not the only reason we do so well," says Anna, our waitress, while passing rakfisk trays and that, with her long hairy blonde and her amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, wise people."
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like bragging, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; all, except a small percentage of the money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money he didn't have during the years that preceded the financial crisis around the world, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we're happy," Anna says.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a stripper.
I'm in the snow doing tail to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now an alce hamburger is certainly something different and rather succulent than taste.
But at night, come back that bad-fat fish.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many venues where a rakfisk dinner is held in which guests vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that testes the nasal graves most.
A TV has been connected live with a host that wears a little bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
Looks like the Eurovision contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There's laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the steams of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a hard start
While the incoming President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC correspondent, Will Grant, analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad today.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation's management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been gaining good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is submerged in a war against drug trafficking that has already taken about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto explained earlier this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, at the Oval Office.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal."
Before joining the U.S. president, Mr. Peña's previous political experience was as governor of his home state, that of Mexico.
A very populated state with rapid growth, which surrounds the capital; The opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute it to the merits of the growth of tourism at the site and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of Mr. Peña Nieto's new roads, which represents a huge improvement compared to the cracked roads full of baches that were rehabilitated.
Plates with its name can also be seen at the entrance of a modern sportsmanship and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We trust that he will make a real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr Peña Nieto, the PRI.
"Particularly, in terms of security and economy, we expect the interesting and true change that our country so needs."
After an uninterrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was disbanded by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MEP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the Presidential Palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations about Enrique Peña Nieto within the party.
It also rejects the opposition's lack of substance of the new president.
"He is a very sincere, very committed man with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic state man and, above all, he's a person who knows how to listen."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the dusk streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under highway stretches is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to assist in the fight against drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in only the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for his violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto's critics say, at best, that he was unable to address the problem of feminicide while in office.
The most critical people accuse their administration of making a big eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain tears while showing me pictures of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
"When I arrived at his house, it seemed like his body was cleaned," she recalls.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana observes from the walls, next to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says has been denied.
"The state authorities have treated me as if I was an old gossip, a disturbing, a complaining.
What they want is that one simply accept what they say and shut up."
"But that can't be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence," he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term of office.
"I hope he's the same kind of president he was when he was governor," says the MP of PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning didn't report ill-treatment, according to prosecutors.
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning's allegations of abuse during his prison stay
The trial focuses on the Manning period in Quantico military prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning's incarceration was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to prove on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the greatest leakage of confidential information in the history of the United States, lost multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims to have suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted to Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney-General Ashden Fein stated that the records of the weekly visits of the unit officers that Manning received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing following the defence's request for the dismissal of the case, given that his imprisonment had been harsh and that that had already entailed sufficient punishment, came one day after Manning had testified that he had thought of suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks posted the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms that the officers filled after the visits to Manning during his arrest at the military prison in Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers would have asked Manning questions and scored their answers.
When Friday Fein asked about the forms, Manning recognized that he had qualified the treatment given to him by the celers as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facilities in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, although the officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning responded that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had discussed these problems and indicated that they would be addressed, but that they did not record those issues in the register.
"They wrote 'no incidences' (after having talked about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean that I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why she had not denounced the treatment she received during the January 2011 meeting with a council to examine the intentions of suicide she had expressed in a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "prevention of injuries" regime under which he was under.
The military said that they had placed him under this restrictive regime, which is below that of monitoring for possible suicide, to ensure their protection and security for others.
"I wanted the old state to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison at the base of the Marines in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said that he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
"My world fell only to the Arafjon Camp, to that cage," Manning explained on Thursday.
"I thought I was gonna die in that cage."
Manning claimed that, once moved to Quantico, he spent most of the days in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some chancles, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while sleeping.
He said that if the keelers couldn't see his face when he turned around at night, they woke him up to turn again.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer filed a formal complaint about Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth military prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in the Thursday statement, according to which, after having been forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of the celers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said that he deduced by the order given to him by the celer that he should drop the blanket he could have covered with, but he recognized that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his chanclas to self-injure but he had not.
Manning testified that that night he had removed his underwear, his chanclas and his glasses from his cell.
Her lawyers hoped that the judge would at least take into account the experiences she had experienced during her stay in prison and drastically reduce her sentence in case she was sentenced to the war council, which was scheduled to begin early next year.
The defence stated that it intends to make Manning guilty of minor offences and defend other accusations considered too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was held under the rules of application to any detained person who is in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leakage of national defence information and theft of property or public records.
If you are found guilty of all charges, you may face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
Affirms that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; he says they remind Mexicans of those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down by the explanation and arrived in the immigration processing area and was already completely confused.
Some posters indicated the way to two tails: one for "Mexicans" and the other for "Foreigns".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where I should go.
As I grew up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
It's ethnic tachygraphy, just as my Boston friends refer to themselves as "Irish" or my New York friends call themselves "Italians".
Later I decided for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather's homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish, good enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don't have a native's vocabulary level and I can't get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought at the time of this week when the elected president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet President Obama.
On the agenda of the day, as always the leaders of these two countries meet, it included: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why it is now so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico as if he would venture to go to the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although she did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to surrender half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements they remember are everywhere.
So, when a U.S. official says anything that involves the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping their neighbors' sovereignty.
And the children of Moctezuma stand up to war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about grudge?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our genealogical tree, there was one person, perhaps the father or mother or one of the grandparents, to whom the door of opportunities in Mexico was closed and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fits in a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, from a poor people, etc.
We are his descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And now we wouldn't find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as solitary souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there is this spray between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more strongly who they are and in the second this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of the two countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they're not part of either of us.
We love to hear the Mexican group Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best in every country, but you're not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
And in the United States we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even more, so I have learned during my journey, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised embassies of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and press the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes, of course...
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much grudge.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna be alone with this idea, folks.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are still not prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful about how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Could there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who started first, lots of buildings have been reduced to debris; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropolis, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite the fact that Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their former conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left it to pieces, whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been caught in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly deadlock situation could be unleashed.
A war that is not lost or won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November is maintained, this week's clashes have strengthened the hawks on both sides.
The Hamas leaders, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, despite the fact that Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza under pressure in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favour.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renewing regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the cause of Hamas. Qatar has also done so, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Hamas' exultant members say that the half-islamic moon is surrounding Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbula militia party dominates, passing through Syria, where the rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas' allies are threatening the king.
Especially in the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brothers led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, differently the most populated and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the lay despot who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
On the other hand, Muslim Brothers are Hamas' cousins and their leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, the hard wing of Israel will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in place.
Israel's Iron Dome Antimissile System has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States is more firm than ever before; many European countries also blamed Hamas for having started the last wave of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Especially under the rule of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has widely ignored the peace process.
Although the rockets fired from Gaza have ended with the lives of some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide terrorists, partly thanks to the West Bank's barrier, the main piece of a territory seeking to become a State of Palestine, and protects the Jewish settlements that continue to grow despite the fact that, according to international law, they are illegal.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose party Likud joined a group of even tougher lines led by Avigdor Lieberman in the pre-election period on January 22, is in a good position.
Why mimic those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled in the West Bank, wouldn't they fire rockets just like their compatriots in Gaza?
It's better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists taking power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel's defence budget is higher than that of its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting a war with the superpower of the area will hardly help the new Arab governments to improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get the ceasefire is a good augmentation and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think in the long term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination implies creating a dustry that one day will explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as this week exploded a bus in Tel Aviv.
Repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demography worsens the situation as the Arab population increases.
Cruential missions to Gaza every two to three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push of people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one demanding sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the assignment of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more momentum to the other people who are struggling for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to halt the entry of arms into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs outside the matter should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to join.
This would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the UN.
Mr. Obama also played an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first mandate, he omitted to present his own peace plan.
Again in the White House, he seems just as reluctant to devote his attention.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The law on generic tobacco packaging enters into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases are displayed on boxes of an off-color green, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, enters into force and replacing the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of an olive green off, a dreadful picture of parts of the body with diseases and representations of sick children and babies because they are children of smokers.
Except for the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all printed in a small source type.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
Australia's federal government states that the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamour.
He relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before 26 years of age, there is 99 per cent chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related a crown logo to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals, other countries are considering taking similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
The tobacco companies claimed that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
"Law will have serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco the counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Other people say their business has benefited after the approval of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, claimed that the demand for silicones and silicon covers to cover the unpleasant images of the drawers had been fired almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, British's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a challenge to the law at the Australian Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was waiting for more stocks.
"It's a good business for us."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws prohibiting television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to view cigarettes, tobacco marketing has become online.
Australia has banned advertising on the Internet to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you market tobacco and you only have this little window left to promote your products, the online space is the most convincing place to be in," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman observed an increase in brand reviews from "foot citizens" published on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It may be asked whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble of making a video or whether any marketing company is behind it.
Australia's British American Tobacco indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulations imply than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to deny the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, despite the fact that none of these countries have a significant volume of trade with Australia.
It is likely that the WTO will issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek stated that the government had held discussions with other countries that are considering implementing similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001 Canada became the first country to introduce the obligation to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India tougher laws are being considered.
Many smokers in Australia are challenging.
"Photos don't affect me.
I just don't listen to them."
"You take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Of course, there is only one reason why I would stop smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, King of the Pack pond manager in downtown Sydney, indicates that uniform drawers make it more complicated to put them in the shelves.
"It normally took an hour to unleash a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
"The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, well, it's over and we close the store," he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to get bored a little.
During this year's Thanksgiving party, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane on which we were flying suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
spending half a day in an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free shops.
But there are more and more academics and children's development experts who praise the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it's okay that we and our children get bored from time to time.
Aburling forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since, today, most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good mood?
Yeah.
And no.
But we'll talk about it later.
Firstly, like many people, he assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("Boredom, an animated story") published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there is graffitis in Latin about the boredom dating back to the 1st century A.D.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in a variety of ways," says John D. Eastwood, professor of Psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the research published and putting the idea before a discussion group composed of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of "desire, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you."
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do anything but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is "the alteration of the care process, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly".
The boredom may sound terriblely like depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as an issue of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be theirs.
Sometimes we think we're bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the September edition of the magazine Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article of a magazine.
Some groups heard in the adjoining room a TV program at all volumes that had no relationship, others heard it at low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that heard the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it was hard for them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
"When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, alteration of attention can lead to boredom," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph, in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"On the other hand, when you're doing something boring, such as detecting defective pieces on a manufacturing line, a music that distracts you can help you not get bored."
"In fact, we now know that moving or making garabates, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert."
"Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stand still," says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it is to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring film.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a "scale of tendency to boredom" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous" and "there are so many things that I'm interested in that I don't have time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, professor of Psychology at West Florida University, states that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically they need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a kind of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and his parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He discovered that 32 percent of teenagers said he was bored while at school or doing his homework, while 23 percent said he was bored when he was not at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the current rates of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that "adolescence is a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels", largely because both children and adolescents are not given great control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, since, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance consumption as a method of combating it, as research proves.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
"Boredom is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else," says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what's most appropriate.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that'll satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
"So, if your son is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dosage himself," says Professor Fenske.
And "this ability to dosage applies to other situations," he says.
Your son not only learns to entertain himself, but also learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Our goal should be, rather, to feel comfortable apart from the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way of seeing, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too distressing and disturbing to relate it to something worthwhile," he says.
It points out that what people really are looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated," he says, "it is difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops."
Colorado: No Book of Instructions for the New Law on Marijuana Consumption
Anthony Orozco, 19-year-old student at a community and football institute in Southeast Colorado, is facing a criminal trial for something that will soon be legal throughout the state: possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, on the plains near the Kansas border, when the police stopped them.
The police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offences that each carry a fine of 100 US dollars) informing him of the date of the trial.
"They treat us like criminals," says Orozco.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the poll in Colorado for the legalization of the tenure of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of minor causes of drug tenure depends less on the law than the location.
Hundreds of minor crimes for marijuana possession are being cancelled here as well as in the state of Washington, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have ceased to file charges against persons over 21 years of age for small-scale possession, which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado's most conservative district prosecutors have committed themselves to continuing with the cases opened for possession of marijuana and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent the opening of newly authorized marijuana shops in their communities.
"All this is changing so quickly that I don't know what's next," said Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, right east of Denver.
Those who take care of the regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the matter around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing system; all of this before the deadline, on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or bad, Colorado goes ahead of most states in terms of regulating the use of marijuana, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
"There is no real precedent that serves us as a model," he says.
The law of Washington, called I-502, enters into force on December 6, which also leaves a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some sensitive mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to offer "appropriate access" to authorized marijuana and its prohibition of carrying out cannabis business on a radio of less than 300 metres from schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centres.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in Seattle's metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, spokesperson for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On 21 November, Oates, Aurora's chief of police, sent an e-mail to his police officers informing them that the city prosecutor would stop bringing prosecutions for minor misconduct for possession of marijuana to persons over 21 years of age and that the police would stop filing charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
Police chief Oates said that they would be responsible for enforcing the city's regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to chase drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, North Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, mainly to pressure consumers and to decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to bring judicial proceedings against those misconducts that at the time they occurred were a crime," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places such as Mesa rural county, where voters rejected the initiative on the legalization of marijuana.
The Grand Junction police, the largest city in the county, no longer quote adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, district attorney of the county, supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the outstanding cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing the consumption of marijuana for recreational use to the government and the judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great environmental experiment in this state.
"It is a cultural barrier with district prosecutors," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents the accused for possession of marijuana and who is a local spokesman of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on Marijuana.
"It's been so long to bring people to court that, in fact, they still can't accept it to be legal," he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national trial cases in terms of drug legalization.
While lawyers and state officials have a new frontier of legal sales, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still provides for consideration of the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
The defenders of the legalization of marijuana have the hope that the Department of Justice will surrender.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has largely allowed there to be marijuana sales for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
"Although drug agents are likely not to throw down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will probably be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of marijuana for recreational use, permitted in the new law," said Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drug policy ex-advisor of Obama's administration.
Several cities in Colorado do not wait for federal authorities to act.
Even before the election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to approve it next week.
"We don't want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level," explained Bob Nicholson, city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favour of what the community voted in front of voting in favour of what the state voted."
Many questions arise in this regard.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I got kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
You don't attack college students for your point of view just now.
I don't remember any time in my life when I haven't been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in which I assumed it was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that promoted the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I took my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to run the history career, I had already packed my bags, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and cried.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard stated that I had abandoned because I did not tolerate some college colleagues having sex in the next room.
Writer A.N. Wilson told me jokingly that I was gone because I was forced to drink in decoyed cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran away from there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason, which in the cradle of the alleged illustration was somewhat intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent advisor to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You may wonder what that comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of middle-right students are suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred towards the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled persons and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (graduate students' group) at Corpus Christi College state that they are "often seriously isolated, personally attacked and treated as unpleasant people" for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their university college's equal opportunity committee to ensure that they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (Paradise: young, bright and right-wing) on student policy and which presented the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazis.
He showed the postgraduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Association of the Oxford University Conservative Party (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, showing a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as "heads of Turkish" by introducing higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice president of the Association of the Conservative Party of the University of Nottingham, stated in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of the left in universities.
People assume we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing us."
Samuel Roberts, 21-year-old and historian student at Corpus Christi who presented the motion for greater protection, claims that this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19-year-old and elected president of the OUCA, affirms that the attitude of the members of the JCR towards people who are right-centered has worsened.
"This poses a threat to the environment of intellectual debate, as well as to the well-being of members," he says.
For my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I went to college in September 1986, she was a terriblely shy 18 - year - old girl.
Hate to the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris cause" after cuts in the funding of Higher Education.
The atmosphere would have frightened any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness I expected.
I found out that the professors not only made a big eye on the moff that was made of the conservative universitymen, but they were willing to participate in it.
The policy of mining strike, privatization and opposition by the government to sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminar.
The first person I attended was to translate French texts from the eighteenth century to English, and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't give one.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like a moustache, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Is it that thatcherists refuse to learn French or is it that they are simply fools?" he asked.
The other colleges laughed.
I was burning the eyes of the tears I was trying to contain.
"I suggest you go to French classes in your free time, as long as you're not too busy meeting people," said Pitt.
I came back to my room like a soul in grief.
That night I sat alone at the time of dinner at college; then I felt a slight kick on my back.
He was a second-year English student named James who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be laborists."
Later, in a local pub, I tried cowardly to disguise.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out useless.
A first year student of Philosophy, Policies and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" asked one.
"They beat each other up, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I have a normal life in Oxford someday?
Would I be forced to meet with people who thought like me only after nightfall?
Would I have to be laborist and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years they expected me were presented as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only professor openly Tory was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
He was hated for being not only Conservative Party, but also thatcher's advice in foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He detested the place he considered provincial and insignificant and for his adherence to the Marxist-Determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents' home in London, finding shelter in my family and friends of more open metropolitan mentality.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the '40s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends always had an impeccable attitude."
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left it."
Out of so many trips to London, my emotional resistance was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar where another professor of history had implied, speaking completely seriously, that I was a "people's enemy," I decided to do the same.
Red of shame inside, I admitted that my parents had "washed my brain" and I called them "old fools."
The truce lasted shortly.
It was my father who put the last nail in my college career coffin in Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two columns a week in Murdoch's press.
My door was locked.
I was in fear and, after five minutes, my persecutors stopped.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me weak weeping.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Prime Ministers of the Conservative Party but, today, hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian designer customers
Somerset House, former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Maestro de la Costura", a retrospective apotheosics that gathers more than 130 high sewing dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the colophon of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the enraged and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, abound private letters and photos with the signature of the most grenade of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social promotion: from humble fashion of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the "jet-set" international.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
"At least they don't turn their butts off on your magnificent carpet as some beautiful pop music celebrities do," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to his villa in Gstaad," explains the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valeria Mazza, looking like a Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also doesn't forget the charism of the modist.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, decoration, food, music, everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and dear," recalls the "top model", which began working with him during the High Costure Week in Paris in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art," he recounts.
Alcurnia parade
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-represented loves.
He loves people with good education and better degrees, and they love him.
One of Somerset House's galleries has been transformed into a glamorous 60-metre long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "hearing" that looks like Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti used in "La Notte", or a wool and skin coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this crowd of mannequins there are names such as Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the modist, 2006
Many of those clients say the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift he made to me," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Fair.
I really like the colors he uses, they have great light and they're "donants" to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
The fashion princess and prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can not forget the first time she dressed a Valentine.
When I was a teenager and I lived in Italy, I dreamed of getting to be the age and opportunity to wear one of his night costumes...
Finally the time came at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard of Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flying skirt, draped "corsage" and narrow word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion party dresses with "the highest care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that she carries."
The "king" of fashion
The big end of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's bride suit at his wedding with Paul of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls its seams) were needed to prepare that ivory silk suit with pearls incrustations, twelve different lace types and a four-and-a-half-metre queue.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of the high seam of the late 20th century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
For years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now his best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest ranking distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any of the husbands of its clients.
"It has always drawn my attention to its refinement, its calm, its pulchry and perfect appearance," D'Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"I was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The hardest trade in the world: the human mules of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers play life and health by loading 70 kilos of sulphur through steep stone trails
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by taking sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphur gas emanating from the Earth's intestines is solidified by entering into contact with the air.
After ripping up large sulphur rocks, which totally weigh about 70 kilos, it carries them in two bamboo baskets that load on their shoulders through scarred stone trails.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb through turtle, keeping the balance and mitigating their steps with temptation to avoid slipping and falling through the precipice.
They know that any misunderstanding could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who decried himself years ago for the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro per kilo of sulphur they extract
Upstairs, the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, fatiguely loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little below, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company operating since 1960 the volcano and, never better said, its workers, who pay 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
Then it sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3,8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries three portes daily.
It takes three hours in each and ends up ground, but they allow you to gather 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhuman effort, it is the triple of what I would win in the countryside.
"The daylight of the miners is very high here, where coffee collection is paid to 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros), " clarifies the carrier, who used to work as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not as hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people close to the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hinduists, and I brought her to Java to become Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughing constantly and irritating his eyes by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing three skins in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass a bill to him despite covering his face with a special mask and glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, he coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that fire the volcano.
It's the price you have to pay to get your dream.
"I will work for two more years because I want to open a shop or study Spanish or French," he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Punished by life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Sharing an unclean wooden cottage with other carriers, he gets up every day at two o'clock in the morning because the sulphur does not stop debating at night, when his characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends to the crater lighting with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers carry sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its pinchy benefits, the mining company has not mechanized the extraction of sulphur to save costs or provide any equipment to carriers, who work on their own and both weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2,5 euros) of extra charge per camera that, along with the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1,2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
"This work is for the beasts and not for the people," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old foreman who has been in Kawah Ijen for three decades, since leaving school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 pounds, he says he will endure working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I won't retire. I'll die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Although the sulphur burns the throat and scares the eyes when the wind changes improvise and catches the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of severe diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, arthritis, knee pains and wounds on the shoulders, which have been malformed by the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can already only load 50 kilos at his 53 years.
Every day, he and his companions start 15 tons of sulphur to the volcano, which three trucks move to Tamansari's warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat road between the weed.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," says Uninik opening her mouth well, where she lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest 30 years old, he also works with sulphur.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest offices in the world: the one made by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the career, stress and cost of properties and education for not having children.
"The population of Singapore needs to grow."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and we believe life!
It may seem unreasonable that these verses are part of an advertisement of mint pills, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral on YouTube in Singapore early this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "Let's put a bao (bao) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, has the hope that with the announcement they will manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their "national duty."
This is purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It's the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily work.
So we think, why don't we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, which is to compose a rap?
1.2 children
The one who doesn't take it so lightly is Singapore's government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in South-East Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
Singapore ' s birth rate, according to its national population division, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time he was above 2 - known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why the Singaporeans don't have any more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policies of the National Population Division, says it is due to a "better education" and "a wider range of career opportunities".
"That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family," he explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy to dramatically increase immigration in order to cope with the decline in the population has created resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where xenophobia is barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who criticize for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year the Singapore government party experienced its worst electoral outcome since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the higher quotas and charges for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on the economic growth of a nation, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore's example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as the "Space Box", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, director general of the EL Developers Real Estate Company, says that his "Space Boxes" are sold much faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that the units are exhausted days, even weeks, faster than the larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, it admits that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers, who were previously blocked if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a city of State.
While these new rules can be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, speaking with Singaporeans working in the financial district of the centre seems to have little effect.
"People are very stressed, houses are expensive and education is also, so many people are postponed," says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
"But it is important for me to count on my own money and time," says another young man of about 20 years.
Men and women mention their career, stress and cost of properties and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to having babies, the Singaporeans have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is the quality of private life or "the scope of private life that has the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a person under the age of 16?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social networks?
Do you understand the dangers to which you are exposed by ventilating situations on the Internet that you would probably not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between ten and 15 years of age, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very mine", on the personal level, and "in the user's key and name", when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets would not put them up to a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They're very secret secrets, my mom can meet them, but not everyone," she says.
In FB I upload beautiful or game images.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a picture other than mine, or someone who's making a fool," he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs of naked persons, crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge assures to meet the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother's included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they're answering me, I just put them up," he adds.
"Social networks are entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly," he says.
No doubt answering that he would never accept an application from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone who would recommend a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to meet 20 of the people added on his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, music for example," he says.
According to the boy, none has been insinuated or asked for the address of his home or his phone number.
"If I was pressured or demanded I simply took them out of my account," he acknowledges.
Joseph became a Ask follower, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not stranger to the experiences of what is today known as cyberbullying.
A friend of mine's acquaintance was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he says.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the bill.
"Just put him in privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set the account safely.
Unlike George, this boy would raise photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
I would, if I like him badly or I want him to.
"Although I know that's cyberbullying," he says.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it should be understood that the purpose of social media is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a means of seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game changed," he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a Master in Pedagogy by the University of Yale and author of the work Native and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
"We are the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He comments that the subject is complex, "because we are asking them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate or not to spread, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
"They are also selective when they care most about being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is is through questions that make them reflect.
"Tell them not to do it doesn't work," he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to publish a picture of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
When you label party photos, did you request permission from the other people to label them?
And one more, does everyone need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do off line.
It's the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, so must it be on social networks," he says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, a professor of primary education and an educational consultant, says it is essential for parents to read social media policies with conscience.
By understanding each of the paragraphs they have solid foundations for discussing with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish," he says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
Finalizes Unsur Summit without publishing the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven attending presidents.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the 6th Regular Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources of Chancellorship and Presidency pointed out at a start that they would deliver it after the closure, but later stated that at some point it would be published on the Peruvian Government's website.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a few brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to the information of the Summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the video without sound of the presidential assembly was broadcast in the press room with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The little information he circulated among the reporters was handed over by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who requested more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it is about Humala's pronunciation, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third South American-Arab Summit (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently demanded by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
On the official ASPA website you can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
On both international appointments, the Peruvian authorities sought to ensure that transmission systems were secured for all journalists, but to the maximum extent possible limited the collection of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Hague Court that addresses a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins Monday in The Hague to hear the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will abide and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are leading to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean couple.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international tribunals," Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, along with the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will be submitted to the ICJ occurred after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had accepted to submit to the judgments of that international tribunal, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the support of Brazil's presidents, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011, after the dismissal of its former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the appointment.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action were set for 31 projects among the South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship for what we are expanding the residence agreements."
He reported efforts to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make drugs more accessible, low-price internet access in all corners of South America, and to jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters".
With a Europe in crisis, "the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphal matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and to glimpse a better future for our peoples," Humala added.
"We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America's spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian president in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belong to Peru, and they are located on the cross-sectional axis of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although it did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve to reintegrate it into the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and integrated peace and good neighbouring relations was another of the issues underscored by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional appointment that he hoped to meet his partner of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ruling of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) you may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"With President Ortega I hope we can tell him to handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they planned to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc ministers met earlier to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay integrate UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru has the pro-temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's president, Rafael Correa, today stated that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), held in Lima, told the state TV Peru that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland".
It advocated, in this regard, the project to establish South American citizenship that is encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
"The free movement of citizens and workers by any South American country must be achieved, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want us back to the past," he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give the chair never commit to anything, and instead, we South Americans sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said in reference to Ecuador's political asylum given to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa asserted that he is not sorry for that decision because he has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values".
He added that, at the time, "there were substantial suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his process was not respected."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding that he be subjected to interrogation in his territory for a alleged sexual offence when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconference, which could be done from the Embassy of Ecuador in London".
Correa stated that there is a risk that Assange's physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since she was at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that she had a small lung problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuadorian president.
What there is is the danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
"That complicates anyone's health," he added.
Correa pointed out that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a rescue conduct that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the enclosure of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent talks.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer Baltazar Garzón is doing a number of procedures in different European bodies," he said.
And he thought that "if Britain gives tomorrow the safe conduct this is over."
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow itself, this problem will end.
Correa took advantage of reaffirming himself as an advocate of press freedom and pointed out that what it does not tolerate is "mediarity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians but the bad journalists on the basis of profit, blackmail and extortion," he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists were no longer "the bankers or the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador," and said that if they were re-elected, they "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the right path and direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the agency "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coupism coated with legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian President also considered "perfectly relevant" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not met.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed extensively to overcome them and to move on.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute held at the same court in Peru and Chile and said that "it is right for Latin America to seek international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to accept a judgment as hard as it is".
In reference to the eventuality of being presented as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive mandate, he pointed out that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa assured that if she loses the February 2013 elections, she will withdraw from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador's, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility," he said.
Winning would be my last term in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that he was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today participated in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test was confirmed: positive AIDS.
"It was like I dropped a bomb," he said when he remembered the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to make "softer," without obvious success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began to report on it; with such an effort he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
It is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which it arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he brought a cut."
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and to do so with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, even many people come when the virus has already caused havoc, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least in the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," said HCG's HIV unit head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after referring that this information was endorsed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system presented by patients at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users: up to 30 years with a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when they report 500 CD4.
In simple words, this means that whoever receives the HIV positive diagnosis at 25 years of age, under these terms "while in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," the interviewee explained.
To measure this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS fell from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the AIDS occurrence, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
Only in Jalisco 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths until May of this year; however, it is assured that there is universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
- It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's how it happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we haven't had enough medicine the problem is that patients get very advanced because they don't know their state of infection, that is, in late stages of the disease.
He gave a strong data: "Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection what has to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and therefore they have to offer massive detection tests to all people who require it."
In his proposal, specialists and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who came to test at a particular laboratory, only motivated by a friend and, despite his short age, was already in the AIDS stage and even suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're gonna die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm already going to die, I'd better blow up three times a week," they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, feed me well, exercise, take the medications.
To date, his parents only know he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have many activities, travel, I have an active sexual life, but corresponsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, within the framework of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let the test be done, if they were at risk, the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the battle motto to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Large are the gaps between health programmes and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapatío journalist who has assumed the cause of HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has actually increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of a hundred, and that is very good, but it turns out that there are those who today, yet, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" it's a common question, with tenderness and judgments of value from social workers, school stewards, pharmacies and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this inefficient distribution; that the condoms should not only be behind the counters and that the hundred would be in public baths dispatchers from the sites that young people frequent.
It's not motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it about paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, asking him if there would be distribution of condoms in his administration.
"This is not the way sexuality is, the best thing is to bring the condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he pointed out.
Keys in Jalisco
There are 13.435 cumulative cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The state is 4th national location in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92% of the contagions correspond to the sexual tract, 6% to the blood tract and 2% to the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV as 4 to 5 people who do not know for a registered case.
Ratified by a U.S. Court of Appeals a judgment that does not know the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Group achieved through a commercial contest in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with ramifications in the neighbouring country with solvency problems.
It would therefore be said that the procedures for the survival of the signatures that permit Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the back of the ruling issued last June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bancarrotas court for the northern district of Texas, leaves Mexican firms undefended against the possibility of embargoing their properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the Supreme Court of the United States, alleging three inconsistencies.
Initially, while the case judge points out that creditors should be governed by the United States Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says that the main procedure is the commercial contest processed in Mexico.
The first point would imply that international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile is unknown.
In fact, towards that end, the United Nations Model Law on the Uniformity of International Trade Law was established and the American Law Institute was placed as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, recognised in the critical mass of the commercial contest, the debts that Vitro's subsidiaries had with their parent, the majority required to approve the restructuring would not have been achieved.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro's has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Mexican Commercial, whose inter-company debts were endorsed by the Federal Trade Competition Institute.
The fact is, furthermore, that by deducting the votes of the subsidiaries, however, the creditors of Vitro who fought against him in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 per cent against 37.
The data is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, it blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 onwards on the back of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, hitting the country.
Soon, the signing of the González Sada family will bring an appeal for reconsideration before the appeals court itself so that the vote will reach its plenary, i.e. the five judges, since they only voted three.
If this is not successful, Cerciorare's appeal that requires a review of the proceedings by a higher authority will be claimed, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court dismissed a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that the latter was disassociated with the conventions signed by both countries to tie it to Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Act.
Moreover, it is noted that the country was bound by the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
General balance
Sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by Mexican Aviation Unions against the company's ex-owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent administration, the Association of Aircraft Pilots already found the bottleneck.
The instance headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has consistently refused to report to the Office of the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the employer to extract 198 million pesos from Bank IXE trust F/589 on behalf of Mexican Aviation.
The resources would have been channelled to the purchase of shares by the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Close to Dragon Mart
Meeting the weekend in a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the country of the wall, with a shelter area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra had succeeded in unifying the governors of the south-eastern area to oppose the monumental coso that it razed with part of protected areas and poses the mother of all the amagos against the industry.
The ACTA died.
Soslayed by the government a Senate's demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement against Falsification, known for its English acronyms as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the archive.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it as an attack on freedom of expression on social media.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes basketball trouts were more than 60 years linked to the sport of the tabloncillo and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sport for more than 60 years, was as a player of minor categories, a player of the National Higher Basketball, powered and leader at the BSN with the Bayamon cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
"I put many hats on basketball through my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball has been my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate by making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memoirs that denote his wide trajectory, so testify.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, those who treasure with the greatest excitement are those who remember their passage through the cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old serving as co-powered or seized of the franchise.
"Those were my best years, which I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight cowboy championships since 1967, whether as seized, co-powered or leader.
It was many years of satisfaction, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I fired with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at the BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had led here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), saying to me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" height.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended Sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember saying that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring another one.
The cowboys' championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already in the distance, since by 1988 it was already more federative.
By that time, he preferred to enjoy his executioners and those of Mincy on the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Preolympic in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 Worldwide, where we arrived fourth place and should have been bronze if not by that Canadian arbitrator who made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 Worldwide group the best National Team you've ever seen?
He's among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team in the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was that of the Pan-Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won us bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the brothers León (France and Edgar) and Mario "Quitote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to an injury on the knee.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Preolympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Pan-American mess of the Sea of Silver, we won gold against all forecasts.
Which has been the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that was Piculin Ortiz.
Its international tournament numbers are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculín did.
And that without counting his trajectory in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Boricua leader?
That's very difficult.
We've had a very good dressing room that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Young people, I really like Leo Arill's work.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that at the beginning of the 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in a season.
What did you have to do?
There were things that I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the island in national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for leaders, desk officers and arbitrators.
I'm pleased with that.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth (Texas), became world-famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R.", in the TV series "Dallas", in which he embodied a man of unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative business.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the J.R. Ewing oil-engineer in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new "Dallas" season, died on Friday afternoon due to cancer complications, according to a family communiqué provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., "Dallas" production house.
"Larry was back in her dear Dallas hometown, representing again the iconic role she liked most," the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife's role in the original series and in the sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a hospital in Dallas, said her publicist, Jeffrey Lane.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I'll miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived his life to the maximum," Gray said in a communiqué.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drinking a lot for years.
In 1995 he was found with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is upset when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him to his house.
She was also protagonist of two comedies that were short on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the cinema included papers well received by criticism in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his greatest star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit was in the air from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate expectation around a full episode of emotions in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars risky in gambling houses.
He also helped give the series a record of audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a chapter of November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and converted "Dallas" into the second most seen entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. pregnant her and then threatened to pull her off as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack her.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as a corrupt insatiable with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who attempted to have her alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), taken into custody.
"I know what I want on J.R.'s grave," Hagman said in 1988.
He should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-protagonist of the original series, reminded Hagman on Friday as someone "great, inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky to meet him and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were transmitted a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in progress, the chain reported.
There was immediately no pronouncement by Warner or TNT about how the Hagman loss will be handled in the series.
Oriundo from Fort Worth, Texas, was the son of the actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had him in 1931 during his marriage to counsel Ben Hagman.
He was lucky at the theatrical stages in New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there she met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memories "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought would hurt someone or somehow affect them," he told Associated Press at that time.
After liver transplant, he became an organ donation promoter and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
"I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then," he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "do not be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but they will be fine."
She was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "large regressive count" of the Maya Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clinged as a proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what I expected him in the next couple of months: The cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé said this week to students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "end of the world" this semester, in theory the last of history.
In Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear warfare, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If the nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could explode.
This month the students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they are compared to examples of real life.
"I've tried to inform students about what's possible, likely, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
At the main campus of the State University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin America History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of Art History and Anthropology, have made a team to teach a course, entitled only "The End of the World".
"We do not add '2012' to always count on the option of imparting the course again, in case the world does not end," Restall said.
Despite the "imminent ruin", students must study, generate projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work "until the same night the world is supposed to end," Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It was saturated in two hours," Restall said about his high average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old career student in Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that apocalyptic, secular or religious mentality is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a student of the 25-year-old Psychology and Nursing career, said to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class that could teach that," he said.
I enjoy it.
But no student interviewed - and much less a teacher - said to believe on the expiration date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a way discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, last year's student at 21-year-old Temple and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he said there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations.
"In other places people don't think about this," he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly responded to the question of whether he knew about any course on the "end of the world" there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pope's pardon.
Restall noted that over the years it has been spoken of many days of the final trial, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately on the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they were planning to go to "the end of the world" parties.
"Maybe I call some friends to laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
