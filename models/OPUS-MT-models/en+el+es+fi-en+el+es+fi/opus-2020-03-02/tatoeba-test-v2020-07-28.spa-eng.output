When we are going to die, we will be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we will be about to leave. The earthly friends - the friends who point to us our position, our wealth or our social qualities, - will leave us when we enter the dark valley. Of those bound to us by stronger bonds - our relatives, our loved ones, children, brothers, sisters, and others not less loved by us who have been made our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior, - of them we must also leave. Although not everything will leave us. There is One who "mains closer than a brother" - One who has loved His own who are in the world, loves them until the end.

In a sunny place there was an old and pleasant country house near a deep river, and from the house to the side of the water were growing large leaves of bardana, so high that, under the highest ones, a child could stand up. The place was as wild as the center of a thick forest. In this comfortable shelter sat a leg in his nest, hoping that his chicks would eclosionase; the leg was starting to get tired of his task, as the little ones were taking a long time to get out of his helmets, and she rarely had visitors.
