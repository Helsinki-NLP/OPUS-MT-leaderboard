The Prague Stock Exchange ended with fewer points at the end of the day
After the fast fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions of the shares of ČEZ reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of commercial Tuesday, reacted immediately to the fall of Monday when it fell to approximately 6%.
This time's drop is due to the fall of Wall Street stocks.
Here too, the market reaction is expressed to the outcome of the vote by the American Assembly of Representatives, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the financial sector secretary.
Fall of actions in Asia
The stocks of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic fall on Tuesday, although over the course of the day the index finally reduced some of the losses.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng Stock Exchange index over its financial day marked almost four percent, although later it mitigated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following Chinese stock movements in Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Sidney Stock Exchange shares lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the U.S. are insecure and this affects the financial market around the world," said Head of the Hong Kong Currency Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it only determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong's interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
American legislators should meet again as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that falls will be felt in other countries.
Bloody bath of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the aid plan for the financial system to which $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion) should be devoted.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, the American stocks lived a bloody bath and mainly the share rate picked up the biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to almost seven percent. A similar volume fall was last recorded in 1987.
The index fell already before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not go forward, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: The U.S. government can inject $700 billion into the bank
The highest representatives of Congress and government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial support to the American finance system.
Their vote will take place early next week.
American legislators caused a gap in the talks about the approval of the rescue plan in their form of aid to the American financial system with the amount of $700 billion (approximately $12 trillion).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must refine some details of the contract before they can make public the final form of the law and vote.
The aid plan for the financial system will be discussed at the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
He told the Reuters agency, Barney Frank, president of the Assembly's Committee on Financial Services and Banking on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate no later than Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, the "displease" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great breakthrough.
We resolve our disagreement with the way the market stabilization package must have," said Democrat Nancy Pelosiá to Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still take place on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with the finance minister, Henry Paulson, to give a definitive form to the government fund.
This should buy from financial companies unsold mortgage assets that lead financial companies to hard losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to close the plan agreement, which will work and must also be effective on the market.
It is necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis expressly affects the market for fast-decreasing shares.
According to the Democratic Senator for Nevada, Harry Reid, legislators are doing their best to have Congress finally approve an agreement this Sunday.
They want to reassure investors' businesses to the Asian finance market as these are the ones in the first time zone and where Congress could influence the trade on Monday.
However, for now there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, even, if they won't stagnate at the last moment with any problem.
The legislators believe it will be adopted in the next few days.
The law, however, will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress could block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme did not fulfil its function, which would be another $100 billion and later the last $350 billion.
Bush valued the advancement of meetings
On the other hand, the president may veto this decision, but Congress may overcome its veto by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was retained that it was to earn financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to finish paying their mortgages.
"We've worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote for the law on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is satisfied with the progress of Saturday and that he values "the commitment of both sides to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of the armoured contract
The president of the Senate Banking Committee, Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said that the legislators decided on the responsibility for the money of the programme for the protection of taxpayers from their losses, a reliever closure of the planned financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called armoured contracts for directors of participating companies in the programme, and create a committee that will have a control of the Fund.
This would have to be led by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on it, and we have made great progress towards the convention that will work and that will be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree with the new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower monthly debtor payment charges and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological aid
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance's economist, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but quite difficult.
"And that's why you don't know what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be crucial for the sharing of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is, according to Marek, not so relevant.
"Many more importantly, this week's congressmen will agree on their support and give them their good looks as soon as they can.
This important and psychological agreement for such approval is, at the moment, the most important," Marek insisted.
Armed fight: MP3 Reproductor against mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost every mobile reproduces MP3 files, no MP3 player gets to make calls.
Which seems clear that it's best to buy just the phone.
There are still enough reasons for man to acquire only the player.
The choice depends practically on the way it is used and the demand of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for you to acquire the most modern disk to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of musical products such as LP discs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to keep buying them.
If the vinyl albums with art rock, jazz or blues are stuck in their shelves, they are probably dreaming, at least, of this type of playbook.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the compressed, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it can be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, the same as for a lover of Pink Floyd who will hardly try the helmets of a 20-kronor market.
Two ends, among which there is enough space for each.
The choice is broad.
Also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just playing music and even that than not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In front of the most elementary functions such as telephoning, sending messages, playing music and video, recording the two, having a better or worse photographic device and can even manage to navigate.
And when we take into consideration the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in their pocket.
This is a little miracle as no refrigerator knows how to make a barbecue and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile before you illuminate the display indicator requesting recharge.
And music playback is one of the biggest energy trays.
Few are mobiles that manage to play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest) clearly have greater performance.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobiles will not reproduce more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of it, constantly call, get still, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive appliances.
With MP3 player this problem won't have it, as even the worst ones can last at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens when recording music on the mobile.
Unfortunately only one part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can connect directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only in some unreduced reader drives the small memory cards that are used on mobiles can be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is necessary.
Enough with filling the device with music through the computer USB.
Most mobiles and players create their order alone in the music library according to the name of the interpreter, album title, genre or also according to user rating.
Some devices only show a tree structure directory similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the selection of a specific equipment be interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the ability of the memory, the quality and type of output of sound and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that plays.
Which practically actually gets any cell phone.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or player plays the music.
The MP3 plays it all and, practically, almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of devices reproduce music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy online music.
It is enough through the mobile internet to visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy a song or album.
This service could in itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most of them are limited only to the themes of leaking the radios.
Prices aren't the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always wear a cell phone.
Whenever you want to hear something, you will find your mobile in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends if you always carry headphones or, at least, handsfree.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least one MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest usually costs less than 3,000.
Between three and four thousand crowns you can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited to the absence of a classical headphone entry.
The best, even with regard to the technical part, such as the telephones equipped with a 3.5 mm entrance for classic headsets, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing but their easy service.
The simplest players - in no way necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - actually handles them any person.
Minimum functions, their handling similar to the previous regular cassettes or also the tocadiscos is evident.
It does not pose a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile and, consequently, giant data depreciation account.
Which device to decide
Even the cheapest mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) generally have a slot to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a proper card it will reach the two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB card of maximum capacity.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy yourself a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) no more than 1,100 crowns need to be spent.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, take the hand of the most specialized mobile walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the walkman line have almost the same use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same price category, over the four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and accumulator (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the most arria brand brings MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive, this year, in the Czech Republic.
Probably.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
Probably won't be long before he gets here.
That Czech operators are part of the most expensive in Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest also confirmed that the Czech Telecommunication Office (ČTÚ) warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the whole Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulating roaming rates, a paradoxical situation is likely to be reached - for some customers of Czech mobile operators the SMS they send from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to regret that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, also said that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classic operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market led to a significant price decline, to which classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the market in Britain, similar voices were heard both there and here.
It was shown that there is room for such operators and that they can succeed.
Otherwise, there is no need to look for examples too far.
In February of this year we informed you about the premiere of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to obtain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, after Mobilking is the Penta group which, besides that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is in the possibility of focusing on many more specific target groups.
In addition, for them to be able to function effectively, many fewer customers are enough than a classic operator.
They do not bear relatively large costs in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators usually profile themselves with low costs - they offer cheap SMS calls and messages that, however, are often offset by the more adjusted service offer.
Thus, for example, mobile tesco in Britain offers SMS at least half cheap with respect to competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good hit the bet for a trivial goal group.
This operator specifically addresses the man.
"The right man chooses Mobilking - is the operator who likes and who you can trust," says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept like that of Poland could be attached to our country.
He doubts Vodafone's spokesman, Miroslav Čepický: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services is relatively saturated"
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, say mobile operators
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be any virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech R. it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, this is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
Indirectly he said that the current mobile telephony operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
Rather the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competition arises.
Interest in launching a virtual mobile operator is already shown by the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step forward to become a real competition of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, so that we can offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phone services.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have met repeatedly with all Czech mobile telephony operators.
With some of them we have made progress in the meetings," said the spokesman for the group, Pavel Kaidl.
Then maybe they'll unlock better times.
It appears that, by informal information, the first official operator would possibly have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"We now believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," he said to mobil.cz, Vlastimil Sršeě, spokesperson for Telefónica O2.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová, in exceptional accordance with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial projects that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to be developed."
He adds: "In the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find a virtual operator until the end of the year.
At this point we should already have on the table a specific contract that could be studied on such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses rather on meeting the requirements of a 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of spending and infrastructure sharing.
It is precisely considered as the greatest contribution from the customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this field is in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a quick internet on the mobile."
Responsible offices - with the operators nail and meat
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition, which would lead to a price drop and thus a decrease in profits.
Then why facilitate entry into the competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to pull out the same rope, proof of it is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on ČTÚ was at the time of U:fon's entry by T-Mobile society.
It is witnessed by public information accessible on the ČTÚ websites.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds: "In addition, the competitive environment on the mobile phone market has not been open to a fourth operator in a long time.
As regards the character of the mobile telephony market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean for him and, above all, for his services great requirements."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging because of the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
It is not just the position of ČTU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in commercial tenders, unlike Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Licitations (UOHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile telephony market would be possible after a contract on the rental of the necessary infrastructure was concluded between a mobile telephony operator and a virtual operator.
So far no agreement has been closed since the offer of potential stakeholders was not interesting enough for classic operators," he added to our question Kristián Chalupa, from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers it is more than just a consideration, besides that they must note that no one takes advantage of their position on the market.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: "In the foreign country where virtual operators operate normally we can see that their entry into the market contributed to the price drop in mobile telephony services"
Evidently, pressure on the proper functioning of the market media and price drops do not fall within the interest of UOHS.
The dramatic shock in this whole case lies in the dissonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in the gas stations because it is clear that it is the work of chance and a tough struggle for competition.
"The Office in this regard has not found any signs of unfair competition and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators have a dominant position, therefore, they have no corresponding rise in responsibility in their market operations.
The tools needed to open the mobile telephony market to virtual operators, rather, are lacking, as well as telecommunication regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets developed by the ČTÚ according to which telecommunications is from the point of view of the commercial tender a single market.
In this type of market, none of the Czech operators naturally has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile phone operator - with all his logic - has the monopoly of his network.
Therefore, in a specific segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least for ÚOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators are strikingly ascending in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with the operators there are many similar impediments.
Carrying responsibility in ČTÚ is a rather common trick in the field of telecommunications of which ÚOHS washes hands in this whole matter.
We've already met him in similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act was recently tabled for the extension of ČTÚ's competition in the field of commercial tenders that did not take effect, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
The representatives of ÚOHS must know this perfectly, but it is clear that their interests are elsewhere.
It's all right, when no one looks.
At the same time, something like a pseudovirtual operator that already exists in the Czech mobile telephony networks remains unnoticed.
They are companies that put their own prices to mobile telephony services which, however, only a part are public.
Usually these are companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only some of the chosen ones get the price list of these companies.
The magic is in that the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a classic business client of the company in charge of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile telephony operators prohibit such resale.
"If such cases as those cited could be discovered, we could talk about breaches under contract conditions that could be translated into the end of collaboration with the given society," she answered the question about this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile telephony operators would not reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned above that it can become thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get no negligible profits and, at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns us of possible problems: "the law allows for such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a despised so much percent of customers.
These, in addition, must accept that your phone's SIM card is not in your name so you cannot absolutely have it as a normal customer of the operators."
This is precisely what the ČTÚ should think of as minimally strange.
There is also a new question for ÚOHS.
If mobile phone operators turn their eyes around in this type of procedure, why do they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has sufficient competence to discover such activities and if it is not to want it should not be satisfied with the operators' explanations that they have no idea of this history and that their trading conditions do not allow it.
When we'll stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile telephony market brought a significant decline in service prices.
At the same time, in practically all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, classical operators tried to protect themselves from this outbreak.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases defended the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they got the first virtual operator to emerge and with him they started to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Body all of this case happens as if it were a burning nail.
Because of our experience, we can only be impressed that the confusion of the powers in these cases suits them.
But don't despair.
If this information between frames is correct and the virtual operator actually reaches these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market will probably start moving again.
If one of the operators lets a virtual mobile phone operator in, it will be difficult for the ÚOHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech hymn has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official hymn.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the day of the Czech official celebrations presented the new official recording of the Anthem Where, my home.
The new hymn was recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bęlohlávek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one by male voice and one by female voice, one with Coro and another instrumental.
Kateřina Knęžínková and Adam Plachetka are responsible for singing.
The authors of the anthem's arrangements are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
The iHNed.cz server can hear the four versions.
Bęlohlávek considers this national Czech song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio already said earlier that intentionally he chose for the singers Solos with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with both and then, also, with the Choir that would be set in the diction so that the text would be well understood, so that it would be consistent," he commented.
The Czech official hymn celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, my Home played for the first time in 1834 in the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyl and arranged with the music of František Škroup.
He won popularity and people made it his.
The first strife of the song after the rise of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official hymn.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" hymn sounds
Prague MHD takes us Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it is written in the history of the Prague Transport Company that the first passengers enter the subway, the tram and the bus with an electronic bonus in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can now be acquired by nearly one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy the 30-day, 90-day bonus and the annual bonus (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it on their chip card at the information centers and positions of the transport company at the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Męstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Andęl, Roztyly, Letjany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Bonds can already be purchased from yesterday on the Internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the Internet as a form of trade can definitely start forgetting the ticket sales positions at the subway stations, where so far they had to regularly line up to get a normal ticket.
The bonus is purchased online, and the Opencard card is reloaded to you in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places there is available to passengers a window with prepared personnel that helps interested parties with the purchase on the internet and also with the recharge of the bonus purchased on their card," said project spokesman Martin Opatrný.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic bonus on the Opencard on the automatic vending machines found in some lobbys of the subway.
What are these vending machines like?
They are red, they remind us of a ticket pickup machine and the travelers will probably have already fixed on them at the stations of the metro of Roztyly, Budęjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city but at the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrný completed.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Enter the Opencard chip card into it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is to say, on the bypass trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the towns of central Bohemia.
"On trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reader card that will help to confirm the validity of the time and the area of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid that sets the schedules for the collective transport of Prague.
Bypass buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also to accompany it with the Opencard at the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver," completed Drapal.
Passengers who do not travel on bypass buses and do not remember when the bonus expires may address the vending machines where the cards are reloaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown the information about the validity of your document.
The Southeast wanted to be part of the U.S. in a referendum
The German Sudetes called in 1945 for Fumaba to be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, some German groups from the Sudetes were presumably directed to the president of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are stored in a particular archive and that are now stored in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov request in a letter to the American President that they do not allow the return of the "land Šumava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - again to Czechoslovakia.
"We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are arriving in German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators" is written in the letter, signed with a "people who carry the fate of Šumava in their hearts."
Given that the union of Czechoslovakia with the Southeast Germans presumably implies - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disrespect, incomprehension, pressure and slavery, the authors pray in the letter to the American President to assume Šumava for today and forever under a protectorate.
"We cannot believe that without considering the opinion of four million people, we are given to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that in no way collaborates with the victory of the allies," the letter writes.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals of the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably questioned this idea of the Shumavo Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum on the Shumavas lands about whether their inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Despite the fact that the text of the letter, with the knowledge we have today in the post-war history, may sound a little childish to us, according to some specialists attentively paints the expectations of the Germans of the Southeast from then on.
Although the Czech Germans had to minimally understand that their expulsion from the Republic was to be dealt with, only a few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain would negotiate for the Sudetes some clear form of autonomy.
Others thought they'd stay in Czechoslovakia.
It is confirmed even by Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budęjovice.
This was in the war, as a German of Budjevice, enrolled in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was arrested by the British and placed in Holstein's prison camp dozens of Germans went to him to teach them Czech.
"They thought that when they came home, the Czech would use them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted on the Benes decrees to be removed from the Republic.
You don't think - pay!
Emotional campaign attacks drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
This could characterize the emotional Campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday.
The Minister's office, Aleš Žebíček promises that it will deter drivers from dangerous behaviours on the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will be felt in television, radio, cinema, internet and brochures.
I would have to deter the driver from high speed and alcohol to the wheel.
And also to remind you that before starting, the belts are tied.
He wants to raise awareness of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, and ultimately also of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories embedded in emotions.
And for this we are witnessed by the "sanguinary" ads throughout the campaign:
You don't think - pay!
The word "Don't Think" is written with great letters on the enrolment.
And in a pond of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a point of dissent can come to pay with his own life.
Ads are going to "measure fear" the viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign on Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of victims of accidents can be seen.
He promises that this will reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Sugar and whip for drivers
"For drivers, the sugar and whistle system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a light passes in red and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks," says the transport psychologist at the Na Homolce hospital, Martin Kořan.
And that's why we need an information campaign in the press and mainly a negative publicity, specifically the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of the dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention," Kořan warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel's interim government president Ehud Olmert pronounced on the restitution of virtually all occupied lands in 1967, that is, the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Highs, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that we must necessarily restore almost all (occupied) lands if not all," Olmert said to the newspaper.
"I'm sure we'll have a little percent of these lands, but we'll have to give the Palestinians a similar percent (of the lands of Israel) because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that in the event of restitution, it would also include East Jerusalem.
"Those who want security in Jerusalem and therefore do not want tractors or excavators to pass over their legs as it happened to one of my best friends, then they will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed out in reference to the two July attacks in the city where several dead and dozens of people were wounded.
According to the president it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Temple Hill, a sacred and historic place" that is within the ancient city.
"Anyone who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted later.
Retired from the Golan Highs
Olmert also spoke about Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Highs, which from its point of view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I do not propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to derive from to win the Golan.
They must abandon their current relations with Iran, they must abandon their relations with Hizbula (Chita movement), they must derive from the continued support of Hamas (Chita movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the Prime Minister said.
Questions after the accident: Are the bus stewards illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In relation to the tragic bus accident of the Student Agency company near the Italian city of Padova, the question arises as to whether the stewards and passengers can move on the bus during the trip.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the stewardship is opposed to the road traffic law," says the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which the twenty-two-year-old steward died last week was obviously caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the less secure place of the vehicle despite having reserved two other sites.
However, the bus may have an accident or stop suddenly, and at the exact time when the stewardship delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to technical permission, with walking places.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must sit down.
Student Agency's long-distance buses have no standing sites, which was confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura, to Aktuálnę.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was withdrawn and we agreed that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is running if they have a seat," he told us his position.
The steward doesn't know the law
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the stewardship - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term "Vehicle Reviewer", whose rights and obligations are not defined," the spokesman Hanzelka adds.
The director of the Road Vehicle Traffic Department of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, thinks that the law takes sufficient care of this problem.
"Depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have footing sites.
That's it," he says.
The buses are divided between the cities, where there are places to stand and with maximum limited speed, interurbans with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those with long distances without standing sites, with the highest speed permit and seats equipped with safety belts.
As on the plane, says the expert
BESIP's transport safety expert, Jaroslav Hořín, sees no major problems in the movement of the bus stewardship.
"During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared to the service in the aircraft.
Not even here is there a certainty that the turbulences will come and that the stewardess can be beaten on the head."
"However, if the bus suddenly stops, it is evident that physical laws are valid.
Same as in a city bus or tram.
The security of the stewardship must be solved by the carrier's internal regulations," he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jančura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier that offers the stewardship service.
Employ in it two hundred.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work to be risky.
"However, at the time I have the impression that the stewardship is risky, then I will delete it.
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, the passengers, when they come in.
It would save even expenses," he says.
In the interest of safety, it is the reason why Asiana lacks stewards in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
"We don't have stewards, we're against them from the beginning.
Before or after this will end in a fatal accident," he said less than a year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened.
In the accident on the line that joins Naples, a young Pilsen steward died who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the passage to the bus without using the switches.
His driver tried in a quick manoeuvre to avoid it, however, he hit the front right.
Jančura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the stewardship's rest were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait until the trial verdict on the compensation of the girl's family but it expects the financial expenses also by the guilty party.
Law reform?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could bring greater precision on the stewardship of the bus in which for a year 30 experts from a group of the Ministry of Transport have been working.
"However, they have not come to any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the system of points, maximum motorway speed and the use of the mobile during the march," says Hořín expert.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the stewards to be an important threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesman Hanzelka, who says that the safety control of buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
Dusseldorf's hope is based on Frankfurt
In the letter from the West LB bank board for its collaborators there are no big words missing.
By the merger of Dusseldorf's bank units with the DEKA bank you can form `a central capital market of the Sparkassen financial group', as stated in the writing, published on Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competition block' with sustainable profitability would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for subsequent mergers in the area of regional banks.
So you get to understand the text, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because just like before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the Federal Institute for Financial Services Monitoring, which has recently made clear to the North Rhine-Westphalia government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For some time now, also on the part of Francfort, there has been a lot of talk about the union of this kind between the DEKA bank, which Sparkasse's customers know about its investment funds, and the West LB.
In truth, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after a half year at the end of August, lets know that he sees no sense in the bank fusion, located on Mainzer Straße Street, with a regional bank such as the Helaba or the West LB.
But the DEKA board of directors, now composed of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, commissioned the board of directors to start negotiations with the West LB on common commercial activities.
In this it could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, that is what is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the Sparkassen field the name of the DEKA bank appears that with its 3000 collaborators is among the most important entrepreneurs on the Francfort financial site.
In 2003 at one point the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinado and the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was without results.
As soon as the plans were made public, Hesse's government expressed itself against Helaba's participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate began the dialogue with the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg.
But it was always played again with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally Günther Merl, the president of the Helaba board of directors, said he was against the plans of coexistence with his bank.
Independently of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks within the scope of public law is necessary.
Well, when the elections to the Bavarian Parliament are due, the BayernLB union with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack partners to do that.
In the south the bank could be just a young partner, although so far it was far better off from the financial crisis that the Stuttgart and Munich buildings did.
On the other hand the Sparkassen - und Giroverband of Hesse-Tuuringia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year avoided the plans of coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form only a part.
On the other hand, it is the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June Merl asked a fundamental question about a commercial model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which deutsche Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband so far gave no answer.
In the end, the West LB can be decomposed, but that, of course, is not the bank's own desire.
Thus, also in the letter from the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the entire bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between unique parts of the bank and the DEKA, that will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth.
But this time, he's assisted by Elena as his girlfriend, and that's why everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a barrel of 5 liters of Kaiser branded beer is built a huge tiger bear that shows nearly 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds know how to produce in their throat.
First Elena gives Luca a little palm, then a kiss.
From Bologna they arrived in Verona.
From there, from the car park next to the Porta Nuova train station, at 23:45 this evening three buses, ` direction Munich, the beer party', are leaving, predictable arrival at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly planned for Italians, a bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to his flag the South Americans are singing, they had already started celebrating at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and glasses with silver-coloured paddles, belongs to these buses.
For five years they have come to the Oktoberfest, bearing in mind that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way over there, during the day on the meadow, at 22:30 a.m. round.
spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of the purity of the Bavaria, sickness insurance and the German guide- Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the road on the highway with the address "Brennero"
There's no beer, not yet.
Rapidly the tranquility reigns on the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the strength.
He stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration make another pause on Highway 8 shortly before Munich.
Finally, when the Marco group has the expected arrival at 6.30 a.m. in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, from the left is written "Oktoberfest", next to Gothic lyrics is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "connoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign store open, that means March!", he shouted in the morning.
"Mark!" Marching and occupying the back sites in the campaign store.
"Do not take the places from the front, for we will block, and all with yellow hats do not sit in the same bench, scattered throughout all space!"
A liter of beer, ruge Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip.
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
He'll barely get out of his place, he'll be busy!"
Third: "This afternoon at exactly ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the road, ties the yellow hats on the trees, signs of traffic and even on a poster of the elections of a great Bavarian People's Party.
It is hoped to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest that is known as "the weekend of the Italians"
There are no exact data on the number of people; it is about 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police are assisted by seven policemen from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistics of the nations present, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assists) and the Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite Italian campaign shop is called Hofbräuzelt.
Nights without sleep for Hypo Real Estate creditors
Germany's banking system is relatively stable, accentuated only last week by Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbrück.
Well, if the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the property finance of Munich, which is quoted in the DAX index, receives from a consortium of the German banks a billion-dollar credit to resist the turbulence in the market.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit aid amounted to EUR 35 billion.
The share of the capital that Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
Money comes as from private banks also from those of public law.
The reason for that is the loss of Depfa's subsidiary.
According to a report, state finances with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period - which now, due to market mistrust, is not more possible.
In the first half of the year the cash bank's capital reserve has fallen by 95 per cent, EUR 2.37 million, also the share of its own capital a little back 1.6 per cent to 1.45 per cent.
Compared to last year's same period, the continued income from financial investments and net profits from financial transactions fell to zero, the imputation income for debtors and some securities also decreased by more than 70 per cent, by EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many revenues from the reimbursement of the compensation costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group as well as the reimbursement of interest according to the federal tax code and to the organized businesses for the consortium companies, the negative balance could charge a deficit with approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state finance at first was lost in speculations with industrial credits for the real estate, which served as a reason for the founding of the Aareal bank.
As much money could not be earned with the financing of state projects, Defa began to intensively devote itself to projects in the area of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortisations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated group's profit and loss account, it is said very inaccurately.
It's a fact that the dividends have cancelled.
By 2007 they were cancelled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became an important state and financial finance in the area of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own customer deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, what happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank credits was essentially down because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa's credit portfolios of its short-term refinancing measures.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for group funding for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of the international monetary markets that are now essentially not able to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money the refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the Hypo Real Estate Board, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need monetary markets for predictable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Monitoring (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now insured.
That's what shareholders and bank creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and the imponderability of the crisis there is no record.
It is even imaginable that there is no need for funding in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be excluded.
It was a voice that on the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvency, so temporary salvation cannot reassure at least people concerned.
The share price fell to 75 percent, €3,30.
The loan courses, on the contrary, are really good.
While priority debts almost do not change, the loan courses according to the position in the property registry clearly tend to decline.
These are mainly the loans of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, for the reason, the loans whose maturity exceeds 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and acquisition of the Depfa that affected the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment in speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are unaffected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime it can be based on the repayment of pensions within a period of time.
Or something is going to happen, which is not risking anyone to imagine - the financial crisis is going to be over in the next 15 months.
But when we saw the news crossed about partial statization, now the security that is already on its boundary became a justifiable hope.
That's going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation of enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put the end point and use new-account transport of loss for upcoming payments of profit-compensation taxes on future change.
Sylvana and the secrets of the Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School, the girls started laughing: German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day in a school in Japan.
I was nervous.
Before I went to school, I was afraid.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in Kawasaki direction and go by train forty minutes to Tachibana High School.
I just had to find the way, lucky I didn't miss.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not as rigorously fixed as in my house, in Lower Saxony.
Of the eight in the morning the students come, at nine at least twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had come to introduce myself.
Besides, I am not a person who speaks with great pleasure in the public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have school uniform I put on an old skirt from my host family's mother and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put on the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything in the right way: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I'm from Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
At this moment I was very happy because I had already begun to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have stabbed, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my Sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, linda"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the girl of exchange had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I really felt robbed.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions - at the same time it is very difficult to understand Japanese English.
Then they all took out their Bents at the recreation.
My host family's mother also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else than boring German bread pieces.
I had rice with herbs, little sausages, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and something like tofu mass meat.
In most cases I have no idea what I like here in Japan.
Things are weird and they have a new taste.
What's certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of sealed plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bents are not just a lunch.
Sometimes a girl prepares a bent made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it in hope of being able to get to know him better during a recreation.
That's what I read in my Manga-Comics.
I'm so curious to see if I can see you here too.
"Why exactly Japan?" my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school for a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because I'm fascinated."
Finally for years I'd rather read Mangas.
In order to better understand the comics and culture, one day I started studying a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I'm going to travel there.
Also because I have a faint tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand it is a severe, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn't feel lost here even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen in my life."
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger runs away, why is he also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the scientist in the field of neurology is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they, acting in a way similar to us, feel the same?
The contributions of famous scientists have been published in an internet magazine called "Edge" for many years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is true without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or someone else being able to prove it so far, although we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least wait for it because all human brains present the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about feeling and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, he does the same thing as the other animals: he makes the dead, runs away or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, of which some scientists make conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, almost always they include the circuits associated with the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the brain crust (because of their participation in short memory and in the executive functions that direct conduct).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of people than that of the other primates and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the brain crust, including knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man differs from the other primates.
Another particularity is found in man's linguistic nature: As most of his experience is linked to the tongue, often that means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even though consciousness would not depend on the tongue, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created as it may, would in many cases differ from most of our states of consciousness.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not allowed to be measured because it has the special hardware, nor is it allowed to be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the conscientious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that would have to be easier for scientific research.
Animal awareness processes could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-memory studies of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach that Christof Koch and Francis Crick followed, the essentials happen rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two can be similar or not.
Curiously, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the brain crust for the formation of visualization.
And what's the result of that for the sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for it, the same as with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a mental state in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as body reactions).
Considering this view, the sensations are well fixed to part of the brain crust, which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature follow classifications of fine feeling because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar so that we can describe the states of others to each other.
For example, Antonio Damascus, on the contrary, thinks that the sensations derive from the simple activities of the parts of the brain crust responsible for the body feelings and the trunk of the brain, the same thinks Jaak Pankseep, but concentrates more on the trunk of the brain.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer absolutely to different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I can't go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men acting like that feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach runs away, because he's afraid?
I believe that the likeness of behavior still does not prove the likeness of experience.
That's true that neuronal comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, cockroaches on the contrary don't have at least one brain.
Is the trunk of the brain responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can it be tested in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposed to be fundamentally distinguished from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress is expected here in the field of neurology while the same is measured by rats and men.
As I don't investigate the tongue and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see beyond my noses, but I prefer to move forward than to work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and the Ukrainian
Iwan Wasjunik, the alternate Prime Minister said that the preparations would soon be carried out under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government looks at UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as the proof of confidence in Ukraine's ability to organize the European championship along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
"But that is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and in both countries there is much to do."
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
Now we have to do jobs with great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"EUFA is not going to take our eyes off."
A more radical step was agreed on in Poland.
After numerous scandals the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish PZPN association and replaced by independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured the president of UEFA Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were convicted because of manipulation in decline to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's counterattack outraged
She wanted to promote a new film, she talked in an interview about private life- and she has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan named her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He's mad and he's back-attacked.
The late war of the two roses in Meg Ryan's ex-partner and Dennis Quaid: eight years after his divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with the American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - a story of a marriage's failure is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his designation as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is "audito that Meg tells the stories of our relationship in another version," the 54-year-old man said to "New York Daily News".
Among other things it is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, again "will publicly remember pain and changes, all that means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently he is twin papa.
And so he ends his statements emphasizing: "Be as my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that's fine."
The prices of airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008 airline tickets and nights in Europe were cheaper than last year.
According to a current study, airline tickets in Germany were cheap even up to 50 percent.
Airline tickets and nights in hotels were made cheap again - this is the result of a study by the provider of travel services and financial services of American Express.
The company has analysed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after the price increase in the first quarter found a major change in the second half.
After many years of prices on the hotel market continued to rise, nightfalls on many sites became cheap.
Compared to last year, prices in 41 of the 48 different cities in Europe increased on average to 6.9 per cent between January and March.
From April to June prices have already fallen to 3.6 percent compared last year.
Trends were more perceptible in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the cause that "the interests of American tourists in travel declined."
The decrease in hotel prices is also noted much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial concentration points such as Hannóver, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices increased to 26.3 percent and thus hit a record in Europe.
In the first quarter the prices of airline tickets also showed the upward trends:
Due to the rise in kerosene prices, travellers in the Economy class had to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-distance flights even became more expensive to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June the prices of airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the changes in prices for the Businessclass and the Firstclass were small.
In Germany, price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9 in the second half fell to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even reduced by half.
The cause of price change is on the one hand the rise in the weak economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalises air traffic between the US and Europe.
The signal of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit flights in air carriers, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay from Borussia to him still doesn't go out to make the top one goal.
Kristoffer Klein very well presented the forced landing of the player of the Marko Martin national selection.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to make a goal.
Everything I meant to say exactly by reacting to what happened, you could read it clearly from your lips.
I just knew you were right.
"We need a second goal," whistled Hermann Rieger at the cabin entrance of the Hamburg stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time ended and most of the present were again in their sites.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of HSV for almost three decades, enjoying a very great reputation as one of those who were part of the group.
That is why his request was noted by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded with his head and raised his fingers in a sign of assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg's main coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that wasn't done.
"Not everything was nice to see today," Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed."
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
"That was a dirty victory," he said summarizing Martin Jol.
This Monday the Hamburg SV will be 121 years old.
On Saturday the viewers had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the table change on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to interpret it," said Marcell Jansen.
I predict that the partial ratings in the table correspond more to the league's vileness than to the dominance of its HSV.
The kipo with his compelled players late like the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the Petric Golder as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to join, but still the kipo cannot shine with his successes.
"We need more of feeling and dribbling," Jol demands.
After the defeat of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the bank salvation package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points a certain period.
That was the loss of the biggest points for a day in their history.
Then the Dow Jones recovered a little.
About 20:30 one of the most important stock exchange barometers in the world scored a deficit of 5 percent in 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and remained in 1548 points.
At this time the biggest loser in the Dow Jones were American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
Goldmann Sachs bank shares lost almost 10 percent.
Only a few days ago a great investor Warren Buffet had participated financially in the company.
The Salvation Plan plans to make available resources to buy so-called "poor" mortgage shares.
But the sum is going to be paid by hit but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive the receipts of optional shares for financial associations that during the course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state's cash.
Action courses in Europe and the United States continue to decline
The billion-dollar aid for banks in Europe and the US does not reassure investors.
The course of the shares of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate low and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the savings of the financial market projected by the state, the US Dow Jones index continues to fall.
The losses of the hypothetical shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the drop in the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue shares of the federal government and private banks, the action of the München real estate finance lost two thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and quoted a deficit of 3.7 percent in 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets suffered a fall.
The opening of the Wall Street Day in New York began with remarkable losses.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion saving package will not be enough to give impetus to financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent until remaining at 10.809.25 points.
The House of Representatives of the United States wanted to vote on the Salvation Project, the Senate vote may be the first of October.
The other European balls also knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.

Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years a mysterious phenomenon has caused the disconcert of researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during so-called gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's Relatives Theory cannot be so correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" spent almost 18 years flying into the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing now threatens a cold death.
For years a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during gravitational assistance to the maneuver, has caused confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they gain an acceleration using the energy of a planet's gravitational field, for example Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick just as the Ulysses Sun probe did.
But what surprises researchers for many years: The missiles do not behave by 100 percent just as expected according to the venerable law of gravitation.
Rather they frequent speed irregularities.
Immediately, the probe has a higher or lower speed.
Physicians could not explain this effect so far.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assistance to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even the General Theory of Albert Einstein's Relativeness that describes the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the US physicist of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study solemnly believes now as before Einstein did not confuse and attempts to explain the anomaly during gravitational assistance with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained of the astronomers in the universe.
"The reason for the anomaly can be the Dark Matter that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The researchers of the universe know the existence of Dark Matter only for ten years.
She supposedly possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
The Dark Matter, on the contrary, is completely invisible which means that it does not send and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, Dark Matter makes at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Abducted tourists in Egypt are free
As the Italian Foreign Minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be freed.
Sudanese kidnappers had demanded millions of ransom.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shooting during liberation.
Five Germans are abducted in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations have already begun.
The Germans always fall back at the abductors' point of attention.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper tells about the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in Sahara are apparently free.
About this the same information presents the Egyptian state television, the Arabic television broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
After the news about the release on the Italian radio Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are free.
'Now we control his state of health," said Frattini.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian companions are fine and are in security, reports Egyptian state television.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shooting prior to the release of the hostages: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just "receive hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers have killed six kidnappers and two of them have been arrested in the border area between the Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded the rescue of Germany in the amount of six million euros; the money had to hand over the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the rescue.
The men had to stay in custody until the kidnappers had a safe route to flee.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Abuse of stepfather "has led to suicide"
According to the court, years of abuse by his stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight charges of indecent assault.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an inquiry study, knew that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court heard that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley in Plymouth on 1 April 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before she carried out her sexual acts, while her mother was working at a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court knew that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been done to her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs Rande had said about her, that after being a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renunciated life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terraza Randle, found the dead woman in his apartment in Plymouth.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself through a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle faced his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that concludes by saying: "I used to tie her and sell her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen replied to Trerise: "You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a terrible experience, especially when you were only seven years old.
This nasty saga ends up with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, it is that if she hadn't done it, the issue probably wouldn't have ended in court."
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse occurred on his daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with loss of data
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet officer who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the Waterloo train.
The documents were passed to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
This is probably the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of the intention to commit an offence.
BBC's defence correspondent Frank Gardner pointed out that the conviction had come as a surprise for many in the English administration.
"They thought this was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under section 8.1 of the Act, the clause relating to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official must be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity for his work in the Secret Services Committee.
Forgotten documents contained secret information on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his house to a secret place.
Construction companies face B&B price
In Britain, construction companies could face a price of over 80,000 pounds sterling after the rescue/rescue of Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government, in fact, provided £14 trillion to protect deposits of the bank's 2.6 million savings.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
The Director General of the Association of Construction Societies (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers "humillant" that companies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the 14 trillion loan should be reimbursed after Bradford and Bingley's mortgages are redeemed.
However, interest earned in the meantime is assumed to be charged each year to the 700 financial corporations with deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that the institutions that behaved prudently ... are called to pay the price of the institutions that have been much less prudent today.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is to say, each company had to pay in proportion to bank deposits, and mediation companies had to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450,000 in 2009.
This implies that societies will have to recover £81,000 in order to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
"It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of some society since 1945.
"We will have to examine all aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members against what could be a relevant price," added Mr. Cole.
The interest accrued in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of demandable interest, which can be almost twice as much.
Being mutually constructed organizations and not shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest rates in their savings.
The price of milk rises from five pence per litre
The inhabitants of the Jersey stand will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price for dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre since next Monday.
It is the second price increase of this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following the investigations carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases for their customers.
The last time the highest price of milk had increased before February, was in 2002.
Denying bail to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court in Bangladesh has rejected the application for bail for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court did not grant him bail accusing him of extortion of 50 million taka ($729,700) to an entrepreneur when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various accusations of corruption in his charge.
His long-time political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail at the beginning of this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next few weeks, but his party, the Awami League, has demanded that the country's government, who is militaryly involved, first grant him full freedom.
The correspondents say that while he was given parole to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of his release are or will she be able to remain free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request for bail for Sheikh Hasina, claiming that he could not obtain bail because he was already being treated abroad on parole," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"Let's file an appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her defenders argued that she needed bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina should return to her country after October 17, according to a leader of the Awami League last Sunday.
She was arrested last year after the interim government, backed by the army, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges against them.
Fears for the campaign against polio in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan – says the UN – have not been able to take advantage of a recent anti-polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations has carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in some parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
One UN spokesman said that it happened despite the promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials while carrying out the vaccinations.
BSkyB Loses Legal Challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision that forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival broadcasting ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competition Appeals that it will have to reduce its participation of 17.9% in ITV by less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission stated that BSkyB's interests impede competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, in buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV participation raised doubts about ITV's independence, and encouraged the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and regulator Ofcom opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have given its voting rights.
New investigation into the assumption of state-owned lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector-General of the Department of Justice criticized the performance of administrative officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former Produrator General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials interrogated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in attempting to impede justice.
"Great allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine state-owned lawyers were removed from office by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision by suggesting that lawyers had been dismissed for low performance.
But later it was learned that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that farewells would be motivated for political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked on the persecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate complaints of electoral fraud against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute judicial cases for the government
and can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for dismissals, gave up his position.
A certain number of other Department of Justice officials did the same.
The Attorney General's report is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and underlines how he had a "primary responsibility" for the dismissals, who "abdicated" his leadership position and was "notably non-collaborative" in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epic of great honor
The rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for his epic Bat Out Of Hell anthem.
The singer, who will collect the special prize next week at the ceremony in London, said that obtaining this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album that Meat Loaf won in 1977.
Coldplay's group is taking the nominations for this year's prizes and making the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are some songs that transcend time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them. "
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal capacity such as that used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the hymn.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the rankings.
However, Bat Out Of Hell of Meat Loaf remained in the rankings for about nine years and came to sell more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including a surgical operation due to his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
Later it emerged that he had a cyst in his vocal cord.
Dark street of the city, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply serving.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-standing local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends to the north of the Primiera Street – before I found the Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alley more than one active track.
No sign.
It's practically impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on the Primiera Street
you want to restore Extra Place and create a clean corridor to shops and boutiques that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include the old-fashioned neighbors who commented on being enchanted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remains of the past of the block before the appropriation of the buildings.
However, the Department of Housing, Conservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Community Vencity Committee for Land Use this month, the representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, requested a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community n.3.
"The city is now owned by very few spaces and we would like it to continue to possess Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider Avalon's proposals to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to guarantee public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that he wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea Avalon could buy the street came up for the first time during this month's meeting.
But Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that even though the company wanted to use the street, it didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"Avalon Bay's primary concern is the renewal of this abandoned alley and the possibility of making it a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Conservation Committee, confirmed that it was a city's desire to sell the street and noted that the agency's mission is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those at Bowery, Extra Place has left a footprint in history.
Some believe he got his name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, was opened in Extra Place, but the street is perhaps better known for the photograph of the establishment that leaves on the deck of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The environment was magnificent," commented Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and barrel pieces, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about East Village Bourgeois, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, even modest, must remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, practically unchanged, a city border that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk about the history of the city about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little narrow and outgoing alley, also dark by day and marked by rusty iron and counter-window storage doors, with old weekly newspapers blown up along the canals."
With few exceptions, the street seemed more or less the same in a recent afternoon.
A rat healed through the back of the street and stood near the door used to enter the CBGB and now hosts a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty bottle of about 22-oz beer were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but they suggested that you could give him a cleansing.
Mr Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimated the attractive power of the street in their current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, wet and disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in English
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old associate in studies on California and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are the example of that.
Mr. Obama's campaign notes that "Afro-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students," and this is a very certain consideration.
In order to combat such differences in learning events, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, inter alia, "transition bilingual education" for English- pupils.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers in classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in overcoming the distance in the final results.
Let's take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and family with low income:
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are learning English.
However, an amazing 100 percent of the fourth year students, has been positively evaluated in the 2008 mathematics exam
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent have dominated the English language test and arts.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama favoured.
The Sixth Street school emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
Moreover, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the main of the Sixth Street, of the school's approach to teaching English students is in the "total immersion".
Immersion in English means almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of the contents of the instruction.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, said to me, "We have had extraordinary successes with students like this one who has arrived from Mexico and that, if you enter the classroom 12 months later, you would not be able to pick up what it was."
"It works," he said, "we believe it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for replicating by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of its party's politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and its very constant support for dark bilingual education the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
While immigrants must learn English, Mr. Obama has recently trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about the legislation that is only written in English
And instead, he said, "You must make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close gaps, he should carefully consider the education models that work well, rather than despise them or trivialize them.
The price of oil drops sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil was drastically reduced this Monday because of the concern that the American rescue plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
The stocks of crude oil decreased by 7 percent reaching 99.80 dollars a barrel in the morning negotiations at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has fallen from over $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by the financial crisis on Wall Street and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month, before regressing, once again, due to the enormous uncertainty in the financial markets.
Anxiety took over the investors, once again, on Monday, despite the Congress leaders who said they had reached an agreement during the weekend on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was overwhelmed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that took place in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy the Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, as the government said this Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts in Barclays Capital said that, on the frenetic weekend, the negotiations that led to the rescue agreement "does not seem to have been able to reactivate the feeling of the market."
As the economic situation deteriorates, a reduction in demand for commodities, including oil, is expected.
"The prospects for global equity, interest rates and exchange rates will be increasingly uncertain," Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not escape this contagion.
From a product perspective, our most pressing concern is to assess whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China. "
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for next year, as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of reducing the price of oil and gas is 20 per cent by 2009.
Second quarter of madness: team establishes record
After having spent, over the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in Jets' uniform, playing defense, Shaun Ellis thought I had seen everything.
Then he saw how things developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without annotation into a game of deflation.
"I've never seen anything like that," Ellis commented.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had played lazily under the cloud shades.
At this time it happened that the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles performing a goal of 12 yards and suggesting the perfect presagio for an afternoon, in which the evolution of relationship between the players had a great leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell and another arrived with 10 seconds in the middle.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps going to Coles.
"He's a player's devil.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were playing in the prey, the defense of the Cardinals was mistreating quarterback Kurt Warner.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a walking shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith shot another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to fail by Warner.
In the last turnover, the mistakes forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They're the biggest points the Jets never made in a room.
To Team Coach Eric Mangini asked him to describe the madness of this moment, he said: "The second fourth or the third fourth? "
When he was answered both - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can say that I liked much more the second quarter than the terzer.
They have won a lot of points in a very short period of time."
Gebrselassie Rest Heads Your World Record
Once again, Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown that many consider him the greatest runner in history, surpassing his own world record at the Berlin marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the race of 26.2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the fitting race on plain at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has destroyed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the world record number 26 in an impressive length race so he has established a world championship or a world record for any distance, from the countertime race to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has not taken part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect - that air pollution will aggravate his problems with asthma.
Instead, he was aiming to run in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, employing in average some cutters 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since when runners like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa de Brasil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After last Sunday's victory, Gebrselassie told the journalists that he had suffered cramps on the slipper two weeks earlier and that he had lost a week of training.
It's obvious that the suspension left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told journalists.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism - especially in Kenya, the African-East rival of Ethiopia - for the style of orchestrating his careers too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many stars of the world marathon, based on the pacemakers as if it were a race track, and putting records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie's skills as a runner.
This Sunday, at the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race at 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after their pacemakers declined.
But shortly before three miles from the goal, Gebrselassie took a last impulse to separate himself from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi arrived in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female career, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning at 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She didn't take part in the Beijing Games either, so she was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set up her best record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart computing career, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to make head and then recovering them after 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won the second square at 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and proof of colored life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the theme of the great Orlando, a few kilometres from the bright, noisy and colossal city, there is a quiet village, where pride and the complications of the African-American experience become very evident.
Eatonville, the first city completely inhabited by blacks incorporated in the country and the place of childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guayabas, two schools and not a prison."
Now it's a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem's Renaissance.
And, however, in many ways, the city that she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers Project of the depression season - remains a separate place.
The city is independent, dignified and private as it was in the '30s, when Mrs Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resist to share their true ideas with the white man, that "she knows so little about us and that she doesn't know what she's missing."
Even now, in the year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has drawn attention to starting a dialogue on the race issue, many remain cautious in front of the outsider.
"We are very cautious about the way our story is told," said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and a member of the city's oldest church.
"It has to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a paradox of triumph and struggle.
At the same time, it is a historical model of the assertion of blacks and a community of almost 2,400 people living under a double level of poverty of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South - sometimes destitute, other praised - that was born of slavery in America.
It is no wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
A And the concern about Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as nobody here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown into the world through her deep books in dialect such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida guide transformed the city, just outside Route 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a cement face in life as well as in literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then inside more private areas.
"Out the road to the left," he wrote, "there is the modern Maron public school with its white finishes, its well maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions widow Dash's new husband and writes that Glenn Lee "sold drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transitional rooms."
Therefore, in just a few hundred words, Mrs Hurston puts in relation to Eatonville with the self-government, but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Obviously, this Fodor didn't.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
"Zora described it as it were," said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls that Mrs Hurston immortalized by citing men who were singing colourless songs about her beauty.
He added, "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric that often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without notice in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that is still proud to dress with dignity today.
Most residents were fascinated, said Mr. Franklin, while many laughed sarcastically.
"People were always very happy to see Zora," follows Mr. Franklin.
But, he adds, balancing in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer on print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary Langston Hughes and the only colorful woman at Barnard College in the '20s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce - Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorial ceremonies, no great public readings.
"I don't think her contribution to the world or her inheritance was understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a biography of Mrs Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the '80s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane road across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two-lane main street of the working community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the '50s, the struggle for racial mix led to hatred about the community.
"During that season, a group of white boys went down the city throwing oranges and everything against the people sitting next door," said Mr. Franklin.
"They killed a girl, too, once.
They threw him at a car watermelon."
In a letter from 1955 to Mrs Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted instead of honoring my race."
R Residents today say that the disaggregation of schools, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of their young people.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember this - they used to embrace the teacher in the morning and at night," said N.Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins' daughter and executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
"I wasn't hugging your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural gap there," Mrs. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create the space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with boyan, trust and lines like: "How can anyone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous tomb and began to fight to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the bookstore, reintroducing it into the American canons.
The road project came right at the time when Eatonville's most famous daughter went again under the reflectors.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of admirers arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
"The resurrected idea of the road on five tracks would have been to put what you would call curve speed, a true civic pride," said Mrs Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd simply said, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
People from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to the church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (with Hurston's name, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a restored and beautiful Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from the center of Orlando, it can sometimes feel like on a street of the past under a summer rain, in a city as small as that which was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Foreigners who come in search of Eatonville's history, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A A permission in advance is necessary to do most interviews, and some things - such as the murals in the oldest church in Eatonville, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fears that her island community can be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of native pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs Hurston saw all her race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, working, foolish and mixed.
It is a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18, who is planning to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, who said he might need some help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old Winter Park twins, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, in case they dare go up here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to anyone else'," Alondra Kenon says after going to church on a recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a moment to look at his story, it's a very nice city."
This way, in New York, everyone talks about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were to stay away from the kiosks and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass façade of the bee nest offices above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers monopolizing New York face daily with the worst "bad day of the office" since the fall of 1929.
Children for home delivery continue to resonate their metal carts for tea through the sidewalks and carry muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between buildings of loaded apartments, like human mules, with 50 eccentric printing shirts hanging to a yoke through their shoulders. Office workers still wait in line for their food to take in the morning, and it is still impossible to take a taxi between 4 and 7 in the afternoon in the working days.
Employees are still waiting to line their bagel to the vendors' carts, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon in the days of the week.
It seemed to me as if there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I have decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time necessary for the operation to coincide with the calm of the late afternoon in my local subsidiary of JP Morgan Chase, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee's window, to withdraw his cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where clients of the whole life order their checkbooks, tourists seek instructions to go to Macy's big stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my "personal trusted banker," and they were in line for the same reason as I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places from which they had been switched, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a little like a construction company), from the credit unions and savings boxes in their home town whose armpits only work within the state of belonging, and that they say treat customers as their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, broke into bankruptcy, and as the New Yorkers headed to their homes on Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and shops that stood in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
New York's ordinary people have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and her distressed-looking executive director, Dick Fuld, commented on the matter familiarly as if they complained about a colleague's inactivity.
And Lyn, fifty-and-a-something uniform concierge of my apartment block, has changed the normal course of our talks about Brad and Angelina or my shopping to the storekeeper.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings on money market funds.
The switching is done, I'm not taking any chances."
Muslim tombs defiled at the time Austria approaches right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left wing of the extreme right-wing party for the freedom of Austria and the Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated to the extreme right-wing party Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities Against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, 17 January 2008.
They carry traffic signals representing the mosques with a red line that crosses.
The police are blaming extreme right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that the extreme-right political parties made huge gains in the country's general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in Traun cemetery, near Linz, at some point between Friday night and this morning, in what the police think was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as David's Star on some of the graves, but the researchers think this may have happened by attempting to conceal the real motives of the extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident was in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said that they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which came to Muslim religious when the month Ramadan was coming to an end.
In the meantime, Austria is preparing for an introspection round after the right turn in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right-wing parties that captured almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had conducted a campaign focused on anti-immigrant vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against the heads and burkas, and also expressed opposition to the food considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties attempt to prohibit the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, indicate that the change occurred mainly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Prohibition of travel abroad for Gary Glitter
The courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent police made a ban on travelling abroad last Thursday after the judges had produced evidence of Glitter's previous convictions for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, a real name, Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Judges' Court in Kent, but was represented by counsel Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Judges' Court in Kent, the police requested a readiness to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as it did to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd did not attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wished to travel abroad, as a result of being registered as sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the expected date seven days before their departure.
Kent police said they wouldn't discuss the individual case or possible Glitter's whereabouts in the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent police spokesman said: "Kent police will do their best to protect children in this country, or abroad.
"From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who stays in the UK because here we have systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
"Protection of Kent's inhabitants is the main concern of Kent's police and we work closely to monitor the behaviour of sex offenders registered in the county and minimize any risk to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11 years.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to pass through passport control and finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and remained there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrate Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sexual offender.
Glitter had been imprisoned in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for possession of images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of Internal Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Internal Affairs, was reassured and pleased to know that Glitter had been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
"Cape the master out of stage to extract his character" Günther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no premiere suits.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, stripped of the concentration in the interpretation to get the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
Aside the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at those moments outside the public, when finding the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressivity of a hand, disquieted because they are not going to go out on stage.
German Günther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with that less well-known side of these teachers.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different areas.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "may be any people but, when viewing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists capable of transmitting on scene passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
To capture the personality of these artists you don't have to take pictures of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What I was interested in was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the great flamenco."
With the taste of the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long trip to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plaque camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material remember classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classical base of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands the flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of dancing, singing or touching itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the dune that becomes visible in a way of feeling, being and being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
Flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of nearly seventy photographed artists.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits presented in the sample.
The passion for Bauer's portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veteran Sporters" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter an instant in their life, be it a long or short moment.
I think inside the photograph the portrait is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes don't know, or who leave you just a few minutes to take the picture.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco which is titled "Flamenco-people" is displayed in the El Fotómata Gallery, located on the 20th of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, where it can be visited until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel she writes is "a fear"
It settles in places that it does not yet know and address unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to carrying out the new project in which he works, a novel that has as a protagonist Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and passed through the Amazon.
The always favorite of the Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage through the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that today deals with it "is a fear" and that "all indicates that it should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it once," he concluded in his intervention at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days has seen a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people passing through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the feast of the word and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer for the participants - an ancient edition of "Our mutual friend", by Dickens-, filled the forum of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Felix Romeo, he found before him a public delivered to him who became very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, reviewed how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extreme adventure" of the "place to read" and "living more than he lived"; how he wrote of "disciplined hand" to fill his "lack of inspiration" with an intense work of documentation, correcting and redoing much; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influenced his vocation and what "images of memory" are the basis upon which their stories are supported.
The Spanish-American novelist recognized that "there is no way" to measure and know if the books change life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more inconsistent," so he asked the writers to "do not abandon frivolity" and "accept with responsibility" their vocation.
The climatology diminishes the Pozoblanco fair that also runs out of rejoinders
The festivities that closed the festivities of the Pozoblanco fair were suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the advertised rejoiners that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
In this way, the company, according to Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the cumulation.
The weather inclemences have been barbed with this fair, as at last two of its three feasts have not been held.
Saturday was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a enclosure of Castilblanco
So, there was a feast only on Friday.
In him, the triumphant was Daniel Luque who cut three ears and went out on shoulders, after leaving passages with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante went out his two astounded with greetings and an ear, who granted more tended than his bullying.
That is, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the Llanos world without sorrow or glory.
In his second bull, after a relief effort, a large part of the public was beaten.

The agents put the two occupants in a van high and they run away.
His load, more than two tons of hachish, was not enough to stop.
The officers persecuted and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old male, identified as A.A.J., as reported in a communiqué by the Basque Government Department of Interior.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and counterfeiting of public document.
The incident was recorded when several staff members of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out transport control at N-1, passing through the municipal term of Armiñón.
They were prepared to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed the orders, accelerated sharply and the control jumped.
The agents began their persecution until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometres later in the arcen, when their two occupants were deployed to flee to the race through a forest area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized of the 2,178 kilograms of hachees they transported and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear part of the vehicle was loaded with hachees, so they moved it to police units for a thorough inspection and drug weighing.
In addition, the officials found that the enrolment had been "double" since it did not match the collection in the van's documentation, and he has also been charged with the arrest of a crime of forgery of public documents.
The Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed with the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as stated, and to determine the origin of the drug caught.
The 28-year-old detainee, A.A.J., was transferred to police units to carry out the relevant investigations and will be brought to court within the next few hours.
Stop Actress Heather Locklear for driving under the effects of some medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medicine.
One witness saw her perform strange maneuvers trying to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesperson from the California road patrol revealed to the People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 1630 hours, Locklear "was stepping deep into the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get the car out of the parking lot forward and back, and as he went back he passed several times above his sunglasses."
Shortly afterwards, the witness, who apparently had not initially recognized the actress, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and left the vehicle.
This person was the one who warned emergency services because "I was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, who was partially blocking the road.
"It seemed disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess of alcohol was discarded from the very beginning, although "according to the officers at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some medication."
Locklear was arrested as a suspect in driving under the effects of a substance that has not been specified and entered the local prison at about 1900 hours, although he was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left a treatment clinic in Arizona where he recovered from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Callazares urges the Andalusian Federation of IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and Member of Izpar Llamazares, Izquierda Unida, assured today that it will be the regional federation of training that will have to take a decision on the case of the former Councillor of Youth and Sports of the City Council of Sevilla, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of making treatments in favor of family members.
"I for these things am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its competences," Callers said about the action the party will have to take with which until now councillor in the Seville Consistory.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for "transparency" to be present in possible investigations into the irregularities that Silva might have committed: "IU has always defended that such matters have the highest degree of transparency."
In the same vein, he stressed that training has " strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'May Blood', Garci's Epic Bet
Inspiring in the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Blood of May, which is the most ambitious film in his filmography with about 15 million euros of budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried "to illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the tape, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría in front of a wide show of interpreters.
May's blood, with a footage above two and a half hours, premieres this Friday in the cinemas, to become the future a mini-series for Telemadrid more than four hours long.
Great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci claims to have fulfilled this film "a dream of childhood", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to film a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something that he accepted as long as the story was based on the National Episodes.
The 15 million budgets that the Community of Madrid has provided in its entirety constitute for Garci a "one-time opportunity" to accommodate with the decorated and the right costume the portrait of "an atolondred Spain that was wrong as head for which to fight, since the struggle for independence led the people to a huge delay with the reign of Fernando VII", he pointed out.
But the filmmaker regrets not having had funding such as that of Alatriste or The Ghosts of Goya - more than twice the May Blood - so he has not been able to shoot some scenes reflected in a script signed alongside Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost all his career.
For this reason, the director of Back to Beginning has influenced the usual form of work, the setting up with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting the filming and those who don't cast, for he seems "humillant" and considering that "part of the director's office resides in going to the theater and the cinema to know what happens in the industry in which he works".
Many of the interpreters that match in May's Blood repeat before their camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Candidate to Oscar on four occasions - of which he won one -, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The blind sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one to be known," he has assured.
With this film Garci doesn't expect any prizes.
"In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle to make one more movie," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bayón recovers the essence of the Sevillean dancer Tortola Valencia
A Sevillean dancer is going to honor a Sevillean dancer as well.
Carmen Tortola Valencia, a Catalan father (Florenç Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old moved to London with her family.
She was a dancer of free dance and specialist in eastern dances.
He had an exciting life, pioneer of the liberation of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in the Europe of between wars, fascined Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed to me this character and it seemed amazing."
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell his life but to collect his spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
His dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic," he says.
The assembly has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing again to Isabel in one in his shows, as he did in that of "The open door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with whoever his student was.
"Matilde makes Tortola a major, the character of maturity.
I am happy that I have accepted to act in my work and I am very honored for it."
The assembly also features the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, "who makes the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were divas throughout their length, and who always walk in love with them."
The work also describes in some way the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as well as throughout Europe, as she usually resided in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's those women who have a huge influence in a certain time and now nobody knows and much less value their work," Bayon says.
The show will start today at 20.30 hours at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a Newly Married Poet" also closes the Trienium
The presentation of the first illustrative edition of the "Diary of a Revenue Poet" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities programmed by the Cultural Council of the Board of Andalusia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize of Literature and the death of both.
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia and Juan Ramón" comes to an end with the reissuance of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum House and with the itinerary exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: That light chop", which was inaugurated last May and which, after travelling through the different Andalusian provinces, is expected to travel to New York during the course of the International Congress.
In addition, the Culture Council of the Board of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diary of a Newcastle Poet", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and the work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "Ausence of malice", and gives the idea of the unwinding of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
Look how hard it was for them to give him an Oscar.
And he was retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be very sick.
It's still been a pot for everyone.
"Sometimes what you feel is beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend," wept Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
No one was afraid to make a fool or exaggerate.
A father of cinema and homeland had died at a particularly dark time, with fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem for the soils, desperately seeking reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and well few beings left to admire you, there is no need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
Incarnate for all an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and advocate of lost and won causes, from the foundation to fight drugs created in honor of his firstborn overdose dead to his home and organic food brand.
A whole gift to a country that has cost a lot to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of Hollywood's admiration sweeps without attending to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that a man has not died but an era.
Another Englishman, the oscarized director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was no more or less than the summit of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He has left us very high," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today dares to try to live as Paul Newman lived: keeping high the requirement of probity and having a serious and remote private life from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today's media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once, but then he was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years, to whom he was faithful when he was probably left with the chances of not being.
"But why am I going to eat burgers out of my house, if I have steak inside?", he used to joke himself.
In heaven he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, of none he was as proud as that of devoted husband, loving father, solicito grandfather and dedicated philanthropist," they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that Olympics will be celebrated in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called, and in my opinion it has been the worst race with a lot I've been in.
A great deal of disproportion that, of course, if you took it into account as an evaluation and I would examine it, would be a very clear suspense.
But let's go by the sides and from the beginning.
Disposals start with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which doesn't seem bad to me, but if they already make you go to give it all (including the chip to avoid tails in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first disproposite, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the shirt (second disproposite, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with less fabrics and cheaper?
Well, things like these are a detail compared to those of the day of the race.
Apart from having to go too soon to pick up the chip, the tail on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
Over 35 minutes lasted waiting, something incomprehensible for a career where more than 11,000 people are expected.
So, as it was expected, the race started and we hadn't left the backpack yet, although once it got there, the collection was worse.
In addition, the rain amenced the waiting for more than 40 minutes, which met with cones of popular rebellion and assault on the cassette.
I think about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, they won't even show up with the right time in the rankings, because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, didn't mark my exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, this would not get into my thoughts.
So I think we're still dreaming of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft seeks receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on Emerging Technologies Microsoft has shown a breakthrough in a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of Artificial Intelligence without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a launcher to move through the company campus) in response to what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people in the room, who are - even remember what they have put on - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
Also group those present according to conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he's there to visit someone and tells him that he'll be here soon.
Everything without blue screening.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example in the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week has been spoken much above a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers came with the essential instead of loaded with commercial basurilla, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extra" to Windows.
The change of course is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and also the software.
When Google Chrome went to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but one must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute, but relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People increasingly pay less attention to the operating system, and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What are half of the applications that come into the system for?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less rechargeable, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring a little example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft employees' rest rooms, in Redmond, early in the month.
In the refresher machine a poster asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft's employees used Google to search the network.
Last week, by the way, a delay was also confirmed in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather by dropping to 2010.
In Microsoft you will surely look for the set release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is increasingly computerized.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the street, is going to pass the bill.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore her on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio looked like one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather" and is part of the uniform of the Musculate gay parish.
And if we start to list star appearances, we can go back to the image of that fort of punctuary mustache that lifted weights in a circus around.
In essence, it's just the typical male indoor shirt in cotton, tight and sleeveless.
The 'tank', called the speaking Angles, but the Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles points to all the others.
First, by its rimbombant name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with sport because it receives its name, according to legend, by boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out on the others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag ( barely recognizable) that the most emblematic shirt models bear as detail in the neck.
And attention, because the production of the Belgian firm not only focuses on its tank tops.
Also includes college sweatshirts, boxers retro, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, sea t-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothes designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them like underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not prevented him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the Mango firm makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion prizes that the Spanish house sponsors.
Heavy and shy, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penélope and I have devised for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Come on, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
On what basis is your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the '50s and '60s; from there we get many references.
Then, I really like to miss out on a city and watch women as they go dressed, as they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but, in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot of common ties.
I liked the clothes since I was a kid; I wanted to go to my grandmother's house to hurl in my aunt's closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of my dress.
You know that dancers like to make us our stylisms for classes and rehearsals, to look at us in the mirror and feel good.
And on the role of an actress when they give you the dressing room is when you really find the character.
So, everything is united, that is, with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You didn't get 30 years ago, did you get a crisis?
What's going on?
I feel better than ever, I like 30.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done the things I wanted since I was a kid and this has given me a lot of internal happiness.
So, do you think about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because the body asks me and, besides, I want to be a young mom; this I don't want to miss.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm gonna do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As far as the movies are concerned, you're looking forward to several premieres you shot last year.
That's right, and I already feel like you see the light.
I, that I am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, can't be.
I feel like they're opening 'The Last Hour' and 'Seeking the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a walkway with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went on a walkway to make a model.
Simply, Naomi Campbell called me, whom I have known for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a charitable parade for her organization 'Women for a Better World' and the clothes we exhibited - I took two pieces from our collection for Mango - was auctioned to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that sweet heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that, I know her, I'd tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm keeping that good part that she gets involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he comes to ask me to make the pine, then so is it.
To benefit the women of the third world, whatever it takes.
Re-incidence drivers for alcoholemia must install the 'alcolock'
Inside wants the driver with three administrative penalties for alcoholemia to have to install a system in his vehicle that prevents the start of the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was already announced last June and is now included in the annual memory of the State Attorney General's Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver, so he will also receive a course of re-education.
In the experience, in addition to the General Prosecutor's Office for Road Safety, the Directorate-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of the automobiles reported more than once for driving drunk again.
The alcolock would avoid it as it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the breathed air and prevents the start of the car if the driver does not blow abtes; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than the permitted.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and would be on the account of the sanctioned person.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce violations by up to 65% during the first year of implantation.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people every year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before they result in criminal offences.
And to facilitate their implementation, as legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires a reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been piloted in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on an initiative by the PSOE which proposes to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 1740 hours, the scheduled time in the program, British time landed at the Presidential Hangar of the airport Benito Juárez of Mexico DF the aircraft of the Spanish air force in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling.
The sun was retreating, but its rays still forced us to use the hand as a visera to see the real couple come down from the plane.
On foot steps, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier I had asked the taxi driver, whether he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the journey.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and a military fence made up of 27 marine soldiers who interpret the saving of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in sea blue, and she, the Princess, melena to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in the DF threatened storm.
They're giving a smile and a squeeze stop to the photographers before they go to the room where the official comitiva is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where you are staying, one of the four grand in the city, awaits you a reporter of Mexican television.
The Best Fashion Award
There may be no place in the most appropriate world to present a fashion prize, that Paris and possibly there is no more exquisite living designer and bont live than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
He's awarded a 300,000 euro prize.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs at the Mango window in the 54th of the Haussmann boulevard in Paris and almost wept of emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first one is in London.
So many events, together with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the competition, made us end up at a luxury dinner at the opera Garnier in Paris.
With the closeness of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango looked even more spectacular.
Nati, with the heart broken with sorrow and making a heart of guts, for the recent death of his brother, put on a costume from the House and some ELAH dresses, which cut the breath, and from his son Luis' arm - a canyon of almost two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and master of Mango, did the honors and he is so gentleman that he ended up, next to Rotchil's baron, without a jacket, because he had both borrowed them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who went to the store with pants and shirt - of own design - and for dinner she transformed with a sexy long black dress, she was excited when on the night walk by the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a love of 'grand plie'.
Inés Sastre didn't stay on the walk through the palace units, but earlier he taught us on his son's mobile phone photos.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the sight with the presence of Olivier Martínez - another canyon that moves on a motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously asked, there would be no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh lala, c'est la vie.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frenetic everyday life.
And in case it was little, they're all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstore on September 30.
The wake-up almost punishes when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse to imagine being involved in the agitated rhythm that today's life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there is no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of disconnection with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Aside from yoga positions, classic massage or 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers on the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to each one's taste and minutes.
The anti-stress work is called '1001 ways to relax' and its calm will reach the bookstories of the Pearson Alhambra and DK editorial.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relations, this 'manual' denies such belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore body balance and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking asleep
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not talking about these people who wake up very spabilized by telling us something that's happened the day before, but children who talk while they're asleep.
The first time it happens you may take a scare, but it really doesn't matter.
It's a benign alteration of the dream called somnylocchios.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told he spoke at night.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadicly (one time in life, for example associated with a high fever episode), or more regularly (every day, once a week, once in a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause to determine its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, night enuresis (going asleep) or sonambulism, but it doesn't have to be.
As we have already mentioned, they can also be associated with very high fever, stress situations or over-excitation.
Anyway, it's a little under-study phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that I speak in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or otherwise (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the demonstration is very intense it would be useful to observe the child and consult a specialist, to see if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and giving him out in this way.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, therefore it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (e.g. if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stress box).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who are hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them acquire a certain internal calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter dream.
Once the somnylocchies appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless, because he's not conscious, and you'll break his dream.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and therefore he's resting.
Remember that if you are very distressed during several episodes you should consult or find out what causes such anxiety in the child.
If you understand what you say (which is not the usual), do not fall into the temptation to give him an interrogation to snort information.
You won't get anything, because being asleep is not conscious enough to organize his thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming of saying that, with which very careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
You never tell the child you can question him at night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that lasts just a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found the way of victory in his field after a long period of shortage.
Without having made a good game, the team created many goals occasions and was able to make a goal to win the game.
The rhythm was not very constant during this encounter at which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann to pick up the squad with a far shot, Illhaeusern quasi was going to take the "power" and by turn Fonderflick from far, then with Hirn up, Romain with the tip of the foot or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we didn't let the center camper pass and left only Riahi in an attack position.
The beginning of the second time was crucial, first with two times the goal of Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousiens with the goal of Marais, well located to collect the ball rejected in a first attempt of Diebold (53 ').
But the Goleador Illhousiens will not be able to taste his happiness for much time and will be forced to return to the closets a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the occasion and will not be a problem for the eleven illhousiens who backed a bit to "compress" their defense, except in the last seconds of the game during which, after an important farfulla, the ball went very close to the cross-sectional field.
Sarkozy finds furious fishermen
Before taking off to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rodeo for Britain.
Faced with the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who strongly disrupted the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, to find its representatives there.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and hope that he " will come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general board of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to achieve measures against the increase in oil prices, which marks a record when reaching EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysseus spokesman David Martinon, the president "will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies become competitive again and to save the conditions of employment and pay for sailors. "
The fishermen wait for Nicolas Sarkozy on a firm foot.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to mitigate circulation in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have thus caused bushes of almost 10 km.
Quiberon's marina has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-île have not been stopped.
" A filtering barrier " has been placed on the Quiberon Peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination by burning on Monday, at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel tanks of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where about twenty ships blocked the movements of the trade ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantic region, in the afternoon stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery of Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until this Wednesday's meeting that will take place in the ministry to think about any actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which did not support their movement.
" The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " do not want to move to Paris " , for example, Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient Committee on Fisheries.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay oil charges, currently pay about 50 cents per litre but consider that the financial balance point of a ship can be reached with only one diesel at a price of less than EUR 0.30 per litre.
The magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable interpreter of " Two men and one destiny " has died from cancer at 83 years of age in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes greeted the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that weigh in the world economy.
The fourth global aeronautical builder, Embraer, maintains its deliveries forecast for 2008 with 215 deliveries, Embraer's president Fredrico Fleury Curado reaffirmed.
During the first semester, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian builder relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell the aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 appliances to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would intend to sell more than 15 % of its assets
The American International Group insurer, who has been put out of trouble thanks to the American monetary authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of his assets in order to reimburse his loan of $85 billion, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States, this newspaper says.
AIG's board of directors met last Sunday afternoon to examine any sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
The assets of the AIG quales intend to be separated include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59 % stake in the Transatlantic Holdings insurer as well as its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the Financial Times.
No final decision has been made on these sales, the Financial Times pursues.
AIG must quickly make liquidity to reimburse its 85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at risk of seeing the American authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the due proportion among the current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall last Monday after the House of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to save the banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98 percent, or a loss never seen in the nearly 800-point Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq 9.14 percent.
The industrial index Dow Jones fell from 777.68 to 10.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most important fall in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on 17 September 2001, that is, the day on which the exchanges began again after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, to the dominant technology, turned back 199,61 points to 1,983,73 units and the widened Standard & Poor's 500 index to 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points), to 1,106,55 units, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street collapsed after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plane to save the banks that would have allowed to recover some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, the representatives denied the US Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Nearly two Republicans out of three rejected their plan.
" That is not a good signal sent to the market, which the Congress sees incapable of adopting a plan, " said Lindsey Piegza of the FTN Financial.
" This shows to what extent the market had this plan, " added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days will be "too late".
" If the project is really dying (...) the Fed and other central banks will quickly take the relay (the American Central Bank, the N. of the Network) to manage the crisis, which would tighten the credit conditions more, " said Brian Bethune, head of the Global Insight's Economy and Finance.
And by accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day a financial institution falls " in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the Washington Mutual bankruptcy last Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by their rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, which led to emergency interventions for banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing "not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis, " added the FTN Financial analyst.
The binding market went up drastically.
The yield of the 10-year treasury bonus was 3,632 per cent, against 3,827 per cent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bonus was 4,161 per cent, against 4,357 per cent on the eve.
Obama, winner during the first TV duel
The first Friday debate between the two candidates in the White House took place another one to find out who has triumphed between Juan McCain and Barack Obama.
No surprise, the general barracks of the Republican and Democrat campaign proclaimed their own victory in this televised mourning that has been followed by a third of the American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "enough "brilliant" to allow him to slow down his fall in the polls five weeks from the presidential elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion survey published last Saturday grants five points of advantage to Obama (49% versus 44% for McCain), considers that it is the democrat who went well.
Among the indecisive voters, who are counting, Obama won with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his advantage on Thursday with the expected good benefit of his member of his own candidacy, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
" It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts, " Bill Clinton, however, warned this weekend.
Septuaginary McCain revealed his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining his opponent's "ingenuity" on these issues that were at the heart of this first care.
" Senator Obama does not seem to understand that... " he accused several times.
" I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president, " he also assured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican television advertising.
Obama stressed that it represented the future.
Without being disconcerted, he was concise and accurate.
It increased its ability to make the good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so, " he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television advertising that blamed the Republican for not considering the impact of the crisis on Americans. "
" During the ninety minutes of discussion, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama reported yesterday, in front of 20,000 people who had met for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainfall.
He did not pronounce the words "medium class" or "workers". "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, which is considered by Americans as the most capable character to save the economy that is at the edge of the precipice.
" Next week could be a decisive episode, " said Senator Charles Schumer, influential and Democrat yesterday.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's " good economic instincts " with those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster "is the end of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain. "
Reaffirming that it would, despite everything, reduce taxes by 95% of Americans despite the Wall Street outbursts, the Illinois Senator also pointed out that the eventual energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power stations from here by 2030.
Prudentes, both candidates skipped the issues relating to the financial rescue plan of $700 billion (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
" In Minsk, " have you noticed the elections in Minsk? "
Young people and opponents manifested last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislatures.
Some hundreds of Belarusians met on Sunday afternoon since the closure of the electoral centres in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexandre Loukachenko: "The dictator must resign. "
Some acknowledge that they have not voted: "Why, since they will do what they want with my vote, " says one young man.
They do not believe that the regime that made the foreign observers good in order to renew contact with the European Union is prepared to make a democratic change.
Sanctions, including visa interdiction for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean to observers.
They weren't according to the opposition.
" We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the vote count, " regretted Iouri Potemkine, the spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, stresses Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our home, is the executive power.
If some opposition deputies enter parliament, it is because they will have been appointed but not elected.
" But their entry into parliament may mean television appearances, meetings in the regions and bill proposals. "
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts in front of Russia, goes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we are in danger of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent. "
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the electoral process will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalisation of the vote in advance (26 % of the voters in Minsk) favored manipulation.
" Have you noticed the elections? Interrogate the social democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be no more than five Members of the opposition to the parliament, those who best agree to power. "
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Loukachenko and the members of the central electoral commission welcome their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated his tenth anniversary of his foundation yesterday, and his president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has once again become one of the safest and most effective providers of blood in the world.
And above all, he regained the public's confidence that he had seriously been hampered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and the discontent of the public, in February 1994 the Canadian government conducted a public survey, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which sought to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations for such a disaster to be reproduced no longer.
While Judge Krever took time to present his relationship, certain provinces then set up a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Hema-Quebec to provide Quebec and the Canadian Society of Blood to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Hema-Quebec began its activities, nearly 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, recalls Décary.
The situation was discouraging.
After having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work during the years that followed, we have recovered the public's confidence," he says before proudly affirming that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebequesa population had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
However, Dr. Décary recalls that "confidence is extremely fragile. "
Since its establishment, on 28 September 1998, Héma-Quebec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we attended in Europe the birth of numerous cases of the human variant of the disease of the crazy cow, a new variant of the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob, counts Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
Then we support one of the main recommendations of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case the disease of Creutzfeldt-Jakob that is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce measures of exclusion.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of those who had remained in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proved beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by the blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle applied had the meaning. "
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow the presence of the virus to be detected directly in the blood of donors, rather than antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleic acid tests allowed to shorten the period between the time when the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We could reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, one person every 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"That means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Quebec distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products every year, it will pass more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission comes through a blood product.
I believe that today you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion to recover health without concern," says Héma-Quebec's head of management.
" Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen could emerge in the system.
Last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Reunion, which, as an example of the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Be constantly vigilant, " Dr. Décary seeks to stress that in addition to safe supply, Hema-Quebec must also provide sufficient supply.
" Needs increase because the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anticancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
Population ageing also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which on average regroups only 3% of Quebequeses eligible for blood donation. "
All people with good health, 18 years old and corresponding to eligibility criteria, however, can donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel in a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covers the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this donor network need to be renewed as they age and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to retain them and to encourage them to be a regular donor.
Since today's life is very unbridled, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating his blood, " Francine Décary is afflicted.
With a budget of $297 million per year, Hema-Quebec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Quebec, which also manages the only public blood bank of the umbilical cord in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was formerly considered as biomedical waste is filled with a rich blood of stem cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
" We have celebrated a few weeks ago, the putting on the bank of our millennium blood sample from the umbilical cord, and it is expected to take out more than a thousand of these a year.
We should begin to propose it for grafts at the beginning of next year, " says Dr. Décary, who describes this cord blood taking program as very popular.
" Many mothers are disappointed in not being able to enjoy this, " as Hema-Quebec has no resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact on the semifinals
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-finals of the elimination series of the first USL division, thanks to a victory by 3-1 (4-3 in final summary) at the cost of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive match of the final quarters series, in the Saputo Stadium.
The center camper Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal to the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal anywhere, center camper David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goals occasions.
Roger Levesque was the only chess that broke Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first match of the round-trip matches, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be measured to the Whitecaps of Vancouver in semifinal.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the game back to take it by 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless agreed in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact should be faced with Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
Soon – Kovalev's victorious goal
Canada's number one trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 Canadian profit to free-fire barrier in front of the Florida Panthers, last night, at Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the quarter of the Tricolor in six preparatory parties.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal.
" I'm not ready yet, the Russian warned.
" I need another match to feel comfortable. "
He tried to play the most in the first time, wrote Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful ovation. "
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the launching of elections before the end of the year
As soon as the Liberal Party's general council was completed, Jean Charest was yesterday in Juan-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), attempts to make a choice during today's partial election.
To reject the limits of our last great northern border ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented visually by staying on the big lines, at the end of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
On three immense screens, they were profiling spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, of Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Great media like during the election period.
The Prime Minister believes that the elections will take place this autumn, although he saw that his schedule was very full.
The "North Plan " is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister intends to have for Quebec, the "new economic space ", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmony with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential " but did not give a term, amounts of investment, nor a precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed is: particularly hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond " as listed by Mr. Charest.
This "twice large territory like France " is our home in Quebec.
Not only is it at home, but it is in us, " he insisted, to show that he was asking for a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to his relationship with the North, he stressed: the golden riade in Abitibi, the Quebequesa engineering, the James Bay.
" It belongs to us, it is our future, " he added, after having made a theatrical pause to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec always claimed, the Prime Minister specified during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion arises, I repeat that position on the part of the government, " he said.
In addition, "with climate changes, we must rethink our vision of the North, " he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will open every year due to the casting of ices.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuites?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers who come from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former deputy of the Quebequés party of Ungava), have already started consultations near a thirty-community.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has an important role to play.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " , but a meeting at which " a common vision will be given " .
North development would be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan "will be concerted, ordained and respectful of the environment, " he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
" Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought otherwise to transform the challenges into new opportunities of growth and development. "
This was one of the recurring weekend themes, which started on Friday with a big cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival to the party's power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes rebautizing the Beauharnois Central in Embalse Adélard-Godbout.
" From Godbout, which created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution calm and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made the Bay James our party knew how to forge the future, " said Juan Charest.
At the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Turning to the theme of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydropower reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its launch is scheduled for 2012.
" This stays among us, but I expect to be there, " he trusted his militants, raising applause.
Indeed, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not dismiss the possibility of launching a vote this autumn, which the law allows him to.
He stressed that his schedule was still full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal Chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problem accepting them: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular called for the recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that they had a right of veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the major lines of the North Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the North Québec Development Policy that Landry had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, reaching power in 2003, resigned from applying it.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote that took place today), Françoise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
" But what you want is that this is not just a show, " commented leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who returns on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (oh irony!) in the Harper Cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "drew" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says about the relations of the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are facing a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, which has not repatriated its national who is locked up in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
It is a government that does not in any way take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are accused of him occurred.
The only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, renounces its promise and leaves a child-soldier living in inhuman conditions.
The only one who has a false justice to assess the guilt of the defendant.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, without doubt forever after so many years of exaggeration.
We still do not realize that, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", that is the word Harper continues to repeat and that makes no sense.
The time has come when there is no more morality: we can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the head of government so far wants (what will happen after October 14 ?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews, shame is caused by this resignation and nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In his September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's largest gold company attempted a six million-euro defamation process against three authors and a small publishing house in order to trigger a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his?
The outcome of the litigation is of little importance, the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defence and to fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the almost unfunded pockets of the mining company.
The tactics, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly arrangement that will numb the opposition in addition to scaring whoever dares to consider the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's in front of the public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, discussions in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by clawing.
It was enough for the mining company to open its books, records and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the financing of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and support letters for Noir Canada's authors.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can call for a "public" debate by disrespecting his views?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or what you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who holds the authors and the publishers of Noir Canada does it above all because it rejects the brutal manner of the mining company.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but on the basis of civilized changes in arguments, and not in the context of what many people perceive as a persecution-moderacy (assuring the " public debate " , Barrick Gold has just made a request with regard to the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's process is a direct attack on freedom of university search and truth, essential to all democratic societies.
It denies the right to cite credible sources and to have a debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects who dislike rich companies in this world in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long known how to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's merciless persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he has no desire to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to place devices that limit this genre of abusive persecutions.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and Congress leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the 700 billion-dollar plan that seeks to curb the financial crisis that has shocked Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
In particular, I envisage: better control by the elect of their implementation, new mechanisms that seek to ensure the reimbursement of public invested money, new provisions to contain the number of houses not paid, as well as a right of control over wages paid to the leaders of the assisted companies.
The American Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Paulson, the president of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a marathon of Che negotiations lasted two days.
" We make great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets, " said Bush administration representative Henry Paulson.
" Everything has been done to cover the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current Wall Street crisis, " explained the Democrat.
" It is the fundamental point: if we do not do this, trauma, chaos and disturbances over the daily lives of Americans will be immense, " said Republican Judd Gregg.
Negotiations had been over very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that would lead to a new failure in the mood of investors.
The last time they had been set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidential elections, who have acceded late to the negotiations, were rather favourable to the agreement, however, without forgetting to express their discontent to be forced to reach this end.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama gave him certain arrangements to reach the agreement, particularly that which would allow the owners to retain their domicile and that on the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the State.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate themselves.
But these measures are necessary, " he commented on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interrogated in another chain to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied that: "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it. "
" The important points I read show that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we can advance.
He said that the option of doing nothing is not acceptable. "
The 700 billion plan aims to buy with taxpayers' money doubtful debts, assets at risk and inventible from American financial institutions.
It arrives after 14 months of a crisis caused by the outbreak of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgage credits before extending to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAA) and causing a liquidity freeze and a disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had changed the first draft agreement last week.
We believe that we have left the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain "toxic" assets of companies in difficulty are only insured by the government, rather than purchased.
With the aim of tackling the hardships for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision that stipulated that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new fees that would seek to help him recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of 250 billion, to which an additional 100 billion can be added if the president thinks it is necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
In exchange for your help, Washington will get shares in the aided companies that will be worth dividends in case of profits and that will be able to sell again when the storm will be passed.
The federal government will have the possibility of delaying the embargo procedures for housing obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see him subjected to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all his efforts, he is still not sure that his plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both on the part of the Republicans and the Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the chamber's finance commission, told his electors that "with all evidence, Washington does not want to understand. "
" We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not that of taking advantage of taxpayers. "
Democrat representative Brad Sherman, who is an animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems otherwise, but reaches the same conclusion.
" Four hundred professors of economy, including three Nobel Awards, wrote to us to tell us: we asked Congress not to rush and examine carefully the way to go, " he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had again the proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for €11.2 billion (US$16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was relinquishing its competitor in bankruptcy since it lost 2 billion euros (2.9 billion dollars) during the crisis of risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
" This is not lost money, said yesterday the Dutch Finance Minister, Wouter Bos.
Instead, we recovered a voting right in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain. "
During this time, on the other side of the Stain, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers from the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at Bradford and Bringley and over 41 billion euros (75.5 billion dollars) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the British bank's branches and bank accounts.
The Bradford and Bringley bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Engaged Icon
His blue eyes for so long represented his triumph.
Did the American actor with a lovely smile get rid of his narcissist side?
Yes and no.
His ability, his sensitivity and a talent that was evident will also have removed him from the record of power that the true sacred monsters have.
But what a great background runner!
Paul Newman, dead on Friday, 83 years old, because of a lung cancer in his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the latest icons of American film of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, whom he looked a lot like and who was considered for a long time as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No disproportionate ego, last quality brand.
Because in it was projected a whole country in love with the self made man, the fighter of the Pacific war, wounded in combat, who at the beginning of the 1950s studied the dramatic art in Yale, then visited the New York Actor's Studio, before winning in the theatre, on television and soon in the cinema.
This man who milled for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked second in the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret, discreet and committed star disappear with him, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death provoked the vertigo to the cynephiles this weekend, while their big papers are intermingled on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh American art in perpetual move defiles through it.
Many memories come back to memory like the charming cow-boy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on the adapted zinc roof of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed on to the history of cinema.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role destined for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This nice mangant in the sumptuous film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar to the best film in 1973.
A bitter and avenger billiard player in the magnificent film The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961), will repeat the character in The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, who earned him his only Oscar in 1987 among nine nominations.
This face that changes over the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during their career.
Young people know him mainly thanks to George Roy Hill's Slap Shot (1977) in Reggie Dunlop, a coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans again saw him in 1994 at The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With one last role as the best man of the Irish Mafia on the Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the rizo was curled.
Contrary to several film legends that left the race pretty soon, Newman stayed a lot in the world of films, denouncing Hollywood, his golds, his bumps and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered him, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " underplaying " and judging his overly supported benefits.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he interpreted the role of young galan less often than marginal: neurotics, alcoholics, bastards or desperates, whose traits reflected rebellion.
As a performer, Newman revealed his unfamiliar true public sensitivity.
Her film Raquel, Rachel, in 1968 (according to Canadian novel Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdose dedicated him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of puberty and sadness.
" Among the many tributes launched yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (who had worked together at The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very sad: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence. "
Generosity, love of existence are important features of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestatory against Hollywood's excesses.
We will have seen his face reign on the vinegar sauce boats, the sauces, the cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, though it started as a gag.
The benefits of these sales were given to your Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than content himself with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always until the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there. "
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of an American artist so lucid and so generous.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing in the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoice factory?
Very soon, on 8 October, the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his accomplices will begin.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner, in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Office of the Prosecutor, the funds obtained in public competitions were used for their own purposes, justifying on many occasions the performance of tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the town councils - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped in part in the Treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization and in part in the pocket of individuals.
The method, which was also announced by the researchers, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in the public competitions with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the various associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the charge, most of the bills were false.
To this end they obtained the talonaries in the market of the District of Józsefváros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the counterfeit invoice was to be made was decided among others on that tour of the Higher Region of the Balaton where János Zuschlag sent to István Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose I should choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumption and they served as a model for making the invoices he presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, the Ministry of Social and Labour Affairs, as well as the City Council of the Capital.
These bills were mostly signed by István Lados and his accomplice András ěri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" sides he chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However - according to the centre manager - so many people do not fit at the same time in that place.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb Jövőert Foundation - later called Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért - was filled with formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, yet on the bill there were one hundred and thirty people.
But the big fantasy bill manufacturers also exaggerated when they pointed to the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. For in the books of it - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents on behalf of Jobb Jövęert and Hoppá.
The company's manager, Gyęzę Farkas, informed hvg.hu that when he was quoted by the prosecutor's office and showed him the bills, he knew that they were false documents.
"In the seal the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
He added: In addition to the formal problems he did not agree that according to the bill 100 people were housed, since they have only eleven rooms in which so many people do not fit.
In addition, the bill also included meals, while the restaurant has not been working for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice manufacturers were also not informed that the travel agency chosen in Budapest exclusively organizes trips abroad, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated a trip within Hungary as a service, which also did not coincide with the agency's invoice issuance practice.
Furthermore, as was known during the investigation, VAT was included in the document, even though travel outside the territory of the European Union was tax-free.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. for the Jobb Jövęért Foundation, since the services of that company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the employees of the hotel only extended invoices made by machine, however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "expeditors" also made other mistakes, such as in the case of a company in which they put in the invoice as an activity carried out by road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecutor's office - does not perform the company founded as an investment consultant.
Similarly, due to formal differences - inappropriate format of the invoice, false seal - it was found that the invoices issued for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, for XXI. Szazadi Kulturális Egyesület and for Biztos Pont.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfeher Sports Camp, whose representatives denied having issued those bills.
The counterfeiters also did not pay attention to the fact that when Fiatal Városért Egyesület's group ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in the process of liquidation, so he was responsible for the liquidation process - according to our information - refused to have issued such a document.
They consciously issued the bills
Another group of counterfeit invoice manufacturers are made up of those who were aware that they should issue fictional invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifju Szocialisták, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Együtt Foundation to Harmadik Évezredért.
The Collab Kft manager - according to the charge - was convinced by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue fictional bills.
Similarly, he collaborated with Zuschlag and his accomplices the Biogate Kft., currently under the liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices of approximately five million HUF to the Jobb Jövęert Alapítvány Foundation, the Atlasz Egyesület association and the Vörösfenyę Egyesület association, without real economic activity behind it.
There was no movement of capital either, as they later cancelled the prepared invoices but forgot to record this entity's documents.
The next group of counterfeit invoice manufacturers includes those who have some connection with the defendants.
Thus, for example, Iván Kubatov was the defendant of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL manager with a fictitious headquarters in Budapest, who dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices of approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the investigation data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since 14 September 2005 is under liquidation process.
The company's manager was a Romanian to whom Iván Kubatov should have also sent the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation that he issued on behalf of the company invoices for the Atlasz, for the Hoppá and for Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány by collecting the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
None of the companies, however, actually worked because - according to the defendant - they did not get a job.
But he benefited from these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, counsel Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company's registration documents, issued invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for the Atlasz and for the Y-Generació.
Kubatov, on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, gave a total of 15 invoices to different entities worth 14.2 million HUF.
The Office of the Prosecutor considered that Kubatov received VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the society in command Szi-Beri to issue fictional bills used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generació and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországégért presented a competition in January 2006 to Tancs Mihály Alapítvány (TMA), a publicly useful entity of the Socialist Party.
They obtained 500,000 HUF from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the contest's objectives.
For this not to be discovered, they submitted to TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that Arpád Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will probably relate in the trial - as they did in the Office of the Prosecutor - the course of counterfeiting of invoices.
The most interesting thing may be the confession of Chief defendant János Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so until now.
The question is: what interest does it have?For perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him for Zusi to assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since in order to alleviate his prison conditions requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the many perpetrators of highly valued economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of overlapping: Why do we spend more money?
The auction participants are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
New York University neurologists and economists discovered the neurological - economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to the study in Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competitions like eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the volunteer groups played lottery, the other participated in an auction and in the meantime it was examined through the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI) the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could earn money, but during auctions, where it is essential to bet more than the other, when the game was lost, the functioning of the complex called strata located under the brain cortex was intensified.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the mechanism of "self prize" of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in betting is explained as a prevention in order not to provoke an intense reaction of the strata.
To substantiate their theory, the scientific group economists also carried out a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment three groups bet against one person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
In addition, another group was promised that if they win, they would receive another $15 more prize.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in the event of losing the auction the group members lost even that money.
So the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, by verifying the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the group who played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
"These results cannot be deduced from any existing economic theory previously.
For those so far explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation" - Andrew Schotter, professor of the New York University's economics faculty, established.
Hepatitis: When should you go to your doctor?
In the world some 500 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of contagious people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated because many of the patients do not know they are infected.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of different liver diseases caused by viruses.
Symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogenic agents and disease caused are very different.
Hepatitis viruses that depend on the pathogen are spread through two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body humors (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be protected by vaccine against virus A and B, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming the infected food, manifested by means of a general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, it appears in the skin and in the white eye, the jaundice, the excrement becomes clear, the dark-coloured urine and the healing can last up to two - three weeks.
Annually a million people die in the world in cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason for this is that according to the calculations, only one in ten contagions receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most infected people do not know that they are ill because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Premature recognition, systematic medical control, is therefore very important.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently some 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory control as well, it is worth consulting with the family doctor when experiencing some unknown symptoms.
The disease has healing if discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus of the organism, so that contagion can be suppressed and cancer prevented.
On September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of premature recognition.
Does it hurt less who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Oxford University scientists conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed religious belief in how it influences human pain - reported British newspaper Telegraph.
In the framework of this unique experiment they applied electrical shock to 12 Catholic believers and to the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the technique of scanning the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in the series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis took place as follows: they fixed a sparkling instrument on the patient's left hand, which applied the electrical shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to look at two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferrato of the 17th century, and the Lady of the 15th-century Bedroom of Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers had the hope that the show of the Virgin Mary would provoke a certain religious spirit among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo's oil because it was not too different from the other, and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
Patients spent half an hour in a MRI scanner, receiving 20 electrical shocks in four successive parts during that period while watching the painting of religious subject or the other one.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt in "security" as "protected" people, "satisfied and peace reigned in their hearts."
Watching the religious theme picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo's work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment thinks that with any such shocking image you can get a similar effect with the atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
"We should find the portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the outcome of the investigation.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases really change our personality," added Wright.
After these formidable results, there is only one question: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size were shown to the faithful?
Would the vision of a high quality Virgin Mary bring even better results?
You're what you're saying about yourself.
On its tenth birthday Google can affirm: you can find it both in people's pockets, as well as in heaven above your head; you know where your holidays were spent, what doctors you visit and what you're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, this is not enough yet.
On the other hand, the skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwelian vision do not see the essence of the Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated to the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to be able to meet the original goals of Google's founders: "We gather in a system all the information in the world!"
According to Google's leader, the company even after ten years of work that revolved the World is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to deal with all the information.
To the question that what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered this: I would like Google to answer questions such as "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the job that would best suit me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions that seem so simple as long as there is not enough information from the users.
Not all netizens are aware that during their online navigation the searched keywords, IP addresses and pages are accurately stored at the end of the search.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own navigation history, they can re-consultate what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the previously defined and stored preferences.
What will happen if you take advantage of my data against myself, if you collect information about my activities? - ask those users who are worried about seeing Google's information monopoly.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is already confirmed that not only do they retain, but in justifiable cases they also give to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of netizens.
The most discussed example of recent times was perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government the information on his website, called Orkut, to identify the pedophiles.
On the other hand, netizens who care about people's rights, in May, were relieved when the company along with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights, proved successfully before the court that it was right in their dispute with the FBI: according to the judgment, Google cannot be compelled, through any of the constitution points, to provide any kind of information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time the federal government managed to get on the pretext of reinforcing the child protection law passed years ago, about 50,000 Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
Thus it is quite contradictory the opinion about Google: they criticize it by those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, private life, when they start using Google's services, and rebel against it as against multinational conservative image companies.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", not so their rival, Microsoft, cataloged by their Windows as conqueror of the World, as much as they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification codes, or money for their applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly update and looks more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official giant of software.
But it may also be because the geeks see accurately the very problematic relationship between people's rights and the Internet that occurred precisely by one of the keywords mentioned in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the channels of communication available, and while the measures of these varies individually, the essence remains the same: showing ourselves.
A normal young man can have profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music customs, then they can be included in a follow-up system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also have a blog, where the most recent photo gallerys that are stored in the Flickr or the Picasa automatically appear.
We can find out many cases from which it turns out that, for example, the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning's common friends, finds out who she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the company's management: one thing is certain, the definition of private life was completely revalued.
The "on-line" life of a person is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that hides behind the behavior of the youth of our day.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least intends to avoid Google's monopoly, can do it (beginning with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google's search system, but does not leave any prints).
There are many people who do not want to register on the collective pages to prevent them from being found, but Google's "on-line" apps can be replaced, from text-writing software to image and news-reading applications with alternative versions that do not connect to giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible on us.
The public expects almost openly the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion) or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), AdWords/AdSense advertising surfaces threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while services that are increasingly introduced cause severe headaches not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions as well: for example, the senior management strongly rejected the employee's protest after duplicating the company's childcare price, considered too expensive the unlimited number of employees' feedings, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google surrendered to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company according to the agreement leaked any information that violated the good morals and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal regulations says they won't announce any new services in advance, but only when it's already ready to work, which if it's certain that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will revolve the World: while some believe that Google's scanning and archive of books and magazines will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be quoted by the Supreme Court of the United States, others fear their health system, because in it we can create our own complete health profile, with previous analyses, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, it will be able to provide a good raw material for writers of science fiction works, the Scroogled, a novel of the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in an orwelian way that future, in which only a man of Google data can be alarmingly described well.
Two minors helped erase the prints of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ózd.
The police questioned two minors about the double murder of Ózd who, allegedly substantiated, helped erase the prints of the crime - said Tuesday the spokesman of the General Public Order Police of Borsod province.
The young women recognized the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of criminal offenders.
The two minors - according to information from the Hungarian News Agency are two girls - will be able to defend themselves freely.
For complicity they can receive up to five years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ózd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23 - year - old owed a large sum to a 53 - year - old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor to the headquarters of a company in Ózd, where he killed him and then killed the 9-year-old daughter of the victim.
According to reports from the MTI, the young man was prepared long before to commit the crime, as he committed the murder with a previously hidden weapon at the crime scene.
The police are analysing with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech krone - for 100% of the stocks of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the fact that the Czechs have previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State which in a few months wants to sell 60 percent of them.
The Czech economic newspaper E15 reported that the Polish offer has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, so far they offered the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche Börse.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Securities Exchange, declared last week that the worst new owner among the interested would be the Warsaw Securities Exchange and did not disregard the possibility that, in the future, the Prague Securities Exchange would disappear.
Experts calculate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the Patria Finance Investment Bank with a share of approximately 25 percent, followed by the Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and the Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday dedicated to the deeper international financial crisis speak of a "second September 11th".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president - says The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the bill done hastyly, whose objective is to give a solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", which the billionaire investor Warren Buffett spoke of, it is more right to talk about a "second September 11th".
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In the opinion of El Mundo, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that led the world economy to the brink of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the American monetary system is growing, and this will then have an impact on the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congress vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored - the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger points out.
Some states today can still throw life belts into the buzzing financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
But if as the dominoes collapse more bank yet, then neither the new funds nor the new improvisations will be enough anymore.
In the long term, it is necessary for the Member States of the European Union to set aside their nationalist selfishness and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis received only on Monday more than EUR 100 billion - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that there are growing concerns that, as the Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis that is going on as a whim on the Old Continent.
The "savers" will not have to present immediately hundreds of millions of euros, but would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid greater evil?
The smart car imitates the bee's flight
What would be the best method for developing technologies in order to avoid collisions, if not the imitation of existing obstacles sensors in nature?
For example, that of the bees.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of the collisions prevention system.
The Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the automobile robotic steering system of type BR23C imitating nature, to which they gave the characteristics of the bees, with the ultimate objective of creating a system that can avoid all collisions.
During the flight each bee creates its own particular oval space that actually resembles our security protective capsule - he explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technology director of RP and development and research.
They play an important role in the bees' composite eyes that are able to see in all directions at an angle greater than 300 degrees.
To copy the composite eye function, engineers used the laser-ray length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles ahead of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a manoeuvre to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bees, modifys the direction by rotating the wheels to the extent necessary.
Unlike any existing system today, this manoeuvre is totally instinctive.
"If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, on a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a beekeeper does to avoid other bees.
This process must be done in an open and close eyes.
However, unlike bees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonal, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of turning wheels
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for bees to avoid other bees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car the rotary movement and the acceleration as well as the braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and higher their energy density, meaning that they have a longer lifetime than that of lithium-ion.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, much less the storage capacity.
This device in every second should only process some input signals and react according to the case.
It is not necessary to store these data or react with an instinctive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few dozen kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step in developing technology to immediately avoid obstacles, which according to the calculations of the Nissan, within ten years can be incorporated into serial-made models.
Another possibility for your application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to your destination, avoiding the obstacles in your path.
You already have a name for this dear boy.
The written version of the $700 billion financial rescue package has been prepared and will be implemented in several phases in order to purchase bad bank credits.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to the schedule of the East Coast during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight Saturday, Congress leaders reached an agreement on the financial rescue package of $700 billion in total, after several days of discussion - Reuters reported.
We have made significant progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, stating that it is only necessary to formalize the agreement in a document.
The commitment made to the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, Minister of Finance, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said: this program will work and will be efficient but further measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the car back to the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8:00 p.m., according to Washington's schedule (i.e. before two o'clock in the morning of Monday, according to Central Europe's schedule), without causing a spectacular jump in the bags.
On the bill called the emergency law for the economic stabilization of 2008, Monday first will vote for the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the agreement.
We are pleased with the progress achieved during the night and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Fratto, the spokesman for the White House.
The program is different from the Bush administration's original proposal to spend all the $700 billion to buy securities of bad quality credit funds.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit, bad rating securities and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the President's decision.
This programme will be controlled by a special body, in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion will be spent after a new Congress decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously purchase bad credits, mortgages and securities, as well as other "venous" credits as well.
The purchase can be made in auctions or directly - competent persons from the ministry reported.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in a insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the worrying elements, for which companies will pay the amount corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson stated: the law thus ensures the necessary financial means, which can even reach $700 billion to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, to deal with the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything we need to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it - he added.
On the other hand, the heads of the banks who are in trouble and await state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American argot simply calls gold parachutes.
Only in certain cases will payments be limited, and the limitations depend on the form of aid from the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed on gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank retires.
By directly buying bad credits, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the compensations of the bosses are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, existing gold parachute contracts will not be changed, the limitations relate only to new contracts to encourage participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in American history that will be in force a legal limitation on the revenues of the general directors - this measure commented Democrat Barney Frank, president of the Congress commission, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares from the banks participating in the programme, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they will ultimately even be able to obtain profits with the transaction as soon as the economy is recovered and with it the bank.
According to the bill in the next five years, the president will have to submit to Congress a proposal on how to return the losses of the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, on both sides there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
This is not what American citizens entrusted us with, that is, the taxpayers' dollars are not being protected - said Republican Congressman of California, Darrell Issa.
Her Democrat colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: the measures were prompted by the same ones who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Will you no longer need a visa next year to go to the United States?
Kinga Göncz believes that there are many possibilities for about 12 January to enter into force the US-Hungarian agreement on visa exemption - the Foreign Minister spoke about it in Chicago, to the Hungarian residents there.
In his view, " practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time, he warned that in the new system the premise of entry would disappear, but tourists should register before leaving the country of origin.
From today on, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will be interviewed with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing over the Median Cross to the Star of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary and holding negotiations with the international policy advisers of the candidates for the presidency, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favour of the bank's financial rescue package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, secured their support for the $700 million banking aid programme on Sunday, instead there are politicians demanding the resignation of the Minister of Finance.
Representatives of Congress and Administration, after several days of marathon-style negotiations, announced on Sunday morning: a principled agreement was reached on the bank's financial rescue package.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and decongelating the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent surveys, when the economic issues were put to the forefront, Obama regained some advantage and the advantage of McCain that he had gained after the Republicans' convention with Sarah Palin's candidacy to the vice-president disappeared.
In a campaign rally in Detroit, held last Sunday, Obama expressed the hope that Congress will quickly pass the law on the $700 billion package.
He stressed that the proposal included those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and with responsibility (...) is in danger of employment, savings from you as well as whole industries and stability of the entire economy," he said to a crowd of 35 thousand people.
He did not miss the opportunity to qualify McCain's economic concepts as obsolete.
In an interview given to ABC McCain, he explained that "we will all swallow this in hard pain (...) but not doing anything simply is not a viable path."
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a control commission to the minister of fineness and the limitation of the compensation of the executives, he insisted on it.
Obama told the CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, but he consulted with the minister daily.
Congress president Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will probably vote on the bill by Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the most conscious voters - says the Der Spiegel about the weak electoral outcome of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rednegro coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known polytologist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber had taken over.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria - and now these modern citizens are the ones who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the indisputable hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU won 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, during the 2005 Bundestag elections, i.e. even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consecutive modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists already 40 years ago have predicted this, but at the rate they were very wrong. However, secularization, the results of education and settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the fidelity of the CSU voters.
Modernization also increases the possibilities and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself became the most conscious, more critical and more stubborn voters.
It is surprising that in recent weeks just the conventional groups of citizens were the ones who moved further away from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, the graduates and the diplomats.
This was the case with less than 40 percent of CSU support.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
Vienna's conservative newspaper: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "Party presidents are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic policy after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from being involved in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open in all directions to negotiate, but the greens still do not wish to consult on the coalition.
The elections were already held, now everything is around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the party leaders barely let them see some of their decks.
Werner Faymann, SPÖ president, confirmed that he wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to demonstrate that collaboration between the two parties is possible - it already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left the question pending that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, at the post of Vice Chancellor.
He claimed that in any event they disapproved of the era of Schüssel-Molterer.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer cautiously reacted to the red offers.
He said that cooperation will surely not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of ÖVP.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter the coalition, these issues must undoubtedly be discussed within the ÖVP itself.
BZÖ President Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to assume the responsibility of the government," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today the European Summit for Equal Opportunities has been launched in Paris, its host is France, which is also the European Union's turn-in president this year.
Livia Járóka, Member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz, in her message to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, drew attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that plague Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevailing of their interests.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European organisations for the protection of social rights.
Járóka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to discrimination in employment, Roma are left out of the labour market first because of their low level of schooling.
"Most of the young Roma have not finished secondary education and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a small part can obtain a university diploma."
Járóka further stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role to play in the prevalence of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise a broad awareness of these issues both among the Roma and among the non-Gypsies.
For the sooner a Gypsy student starts school, the more possibilities it will have to become an active member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education" - Livia Járóka stressed.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to speed up the school disaggregation processes immediately, and it is essential that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives be properly complied with.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as citizens of full rights," Járóka demanded.
The objective of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized annually since the Berlin meeting last year, which was held in the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at the European and national level of the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
At the end of October a decision will be taken on the fate of the failed Huber-Beckstein duo
Despite the serious electoral defeat, heads have not yet been cut off at the top of the Bavarian CSU, the debate on personal issues has been postponed for the time being.
Erwin Huber, party president and Günther Beckstein, provincial prime minister, are still in their positions, but it is not known how long grace will last.
The fate of the duo, which suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party to be held last weekend of October.
The members of the duo-criticized duo left us: they don't hold on to their posts so much.
They intended to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and base organization, who one day after the "bavarian tsunami" demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the direction of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, one year after the coup against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had "monopoly" in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of the German PBI.
Although in the province of the South, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, the conservatives continue to predominate, in the future they will undoubtedly have to coalite with someone.
As the first sign of the party's restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber's potential successors, also has a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Electors on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that on the list of Free Electors that Gabriele Pauli enters the parliament, whose action against Stoiber was exploited for the coup of the Huber-Beckstein duo and then cruelly removed from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition, he will also receive an active role from Stoiber, who has so far been moving the ropes in the background, the former head of provincial government and former president of the CSU described September 28 as the most bitter day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his view they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be a chancellor if they are not able to enhance together the CSU that played a major role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, he could hardly hide his disappointment for failure, the CSU's losses will not negatively impact the great Berlin coalition.
What is naturally relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the continuing social democrats.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday's elections, there will be no opponent in the Belarusian parliament.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability it guarantees in the country Alexandr Lukashenko, instead according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained rather by the violations of the law committed during the count of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the electoral outcome.
While the legislature of the country of 10 million inhabitants, consisting of one hundred and ten deputies, more than a decade ago, has no opposition, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of doubtful legitimacy, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution this time would "permit" the entry of some opposition deputies into parliament.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the heart of the opposition's expectations was that Belarus, which is increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which took credit to moderate the import of increasingly expensive natural gas from Russia and which contributed to the sale to Russia of Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give Lukashenko and other high-level politicians permission for having a political regime considered undemocratic.
It was a sign of distension when the OSCE, in evaluating the electoral campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than on errors - such as the ban on participation imposed on one third of opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's primary report on Monday even criticized the campaign itself - in which the opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present on the count of votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is willing to have a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago considers the two regions as independent.
- We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has begun - he told our newspaper Alexandr Milinkevich.
According to the candidate for the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable to maintain this situation, even though "the regime fears that it will allow the entry of even one opponent in that weightless parliament."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest demonstrations in view of the results, rather it tries to send the voters their message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the press of the opposition in Russia, the local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that they are increasingly supporting the change among the elderly as well - Milinkevich said, referring to the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, they do not consider it appropriate even the retirees, who are officially the most subsidized by the regime.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in trade deficit, it is only a matter of time that the decomposition of social security that "likes the silence of the cemeteries" - Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, described the elections as democratic.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, declared to the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so that the lack of opposition is nothing but the testimony of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on we have breakfast before we start working"
It has never happened in the history of the Chigi Palace that they put automatic doors to control the entrance and exit of the staff.
But from today it starts with this measure against who it is and then goes to the bar to have a coffee on working hours.
This novelty has been presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument for working better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services" says the minister.
"A new season of responsibility and transparency is now open.
This is Reformism," Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi the installation is completed in all buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There has been no resistance on the part of the employees, says the Secretary-General: "It has been a change shared by the workers and there has been collaboration on the part of them."
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and mid-moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good chaplain at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
of Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences of public employees' illnesses have been reduced by 50 per cent, meaning 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And adds that more effective delivery is required by the Public Administration
Italian, "whose wage dynamics – the minister explains – over the last 8-10 years have been doubled in relation to the private sector and well above the inflation level."
For the time being millions of public employees have joined to oppose the Brunetta decree rules by adhering to the request supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Service shows the numbers, the least absence of work due to causes of illness – he writes the association of consumers – the people of the 'vague workers' are constantly increasing .
Indeed, millions in Italy are the right and productive employees of the public administration who have joined to declare war on the illegitimate rules of the decree."
In particular, the Tar would respond to the exclusion of economic treatments aggregated by sickness due to service; the extension of the time frames in which medical check-up visits are carried out by the sick employee; and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Criminal Prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents are verified at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths in respect of homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," says President of the Republic of Napolitan Giorgio, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, National Association mutilated and invalid for the work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the continued partnership effort in favour of prevention in the workplace, protection of injured workers, assistance to the families of victims and public awareness".
"It has manifested itself, a 'bad', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by its dimensions, raise the cry of the media and the participation of public opinion, instead the daily reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in its dynamics."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is no doubt a resource problem: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular significance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is a duty to keep the phenomenon alive, not to stop the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative standards.
For his part, the president of the Gianfranco Fini House has stressed "as the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes a determined commitment on all institutions to urgently end."
"Data about accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive walk, but this does not remove the number of white deaths to be equally impressive," said Anmil Pietro Mercandelli's president.
"We do not, indeed, want this "decrease trend" to be translated into less attention, because it is precisely when the attention decreases that the tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at the general level too little is still done to counteract the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, at our discretion - Mercandelli has stressed - further controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school. "
"It serves a further effort - it has added - as regards communication and public awareness.
But it serves, above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers with regard to a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary guardianship envisaged for the victims of work" and "the provision of assistance to which the system is being directed in recent years".
"The objective is to restore the worker's insurance guarantee - he added - because the fate of the accident does not have to depend on the gift made by the legislator every time."
Mp3 readers under accusation, put the hearing at risk
Listening to high volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent lesions to the hearing.
As regards the European Commission, in a communiqué published in Bruxel, it cites the opinion of the Scientific Commission on the emerging and recently identified health risk (Csrseri) of the Ue, published today.
"From this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity."
"I'm concerned that such a high number of young people who often use portable music devices and high acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irremediable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"A clear risk emerges from scientific evidence – it follows responsibility Ue – and we must react quickly.
What counts is to sensitize consumers and provide this information of public domain.
We must also review the existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are widely effective and take the lead with the new technology."
Bruxel had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the great use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise that originates.
"Scientists - the executive Ue concludes - confirm that it is a matter of concern and the European Commission will now examine together with Member States and stakeholders that measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and related devices."
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concerns are increasing as hearing damage can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these damages greatly by using solutions such as reduction of levels and exposure time to noise.
In its view, the Ue Scientific Committee presents that users of portable musical devices listen to a high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit on the maximum agreed noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Ue.
Rome, German gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which was established this morning at its new headquarters behind the Thermos de Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission discussed the main points for Rome.
Once the doors were closed in March, the board and the communal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Piano for Rome with the "official ball" of the Municipality and its intendent Gianni Germano.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – it tends to underline German – It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who politically decide, the board and the municipal council, can then be endorsed.
There is no leftover position of roles, only the will to have a place to develop a great project for Rome.
In March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise temporary finish.
In June – announces the intendent – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome."
To whom the Commission is accused of being useless, as its opinions are not binding, Germany responds: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will be able to carry out and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be present, as well as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be essential.
Politics is almost always crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that are manifested back and forth.
On the contrary, we want to look further and in the long term, in a deeper prospect, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
The head of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a banality: it is absolutely free, it does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and it will serve to involve and reason the best minds of the capital."
For German, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit for its future."
A future that, the intendent of Rome says, would not be limited to the current communal confines, but would look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal state of Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He has written an American political note that he is interested in becoming independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the US economy and tube relations (as he does today also gives private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the date of the elections is approaching.
has written a lady from Miami on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a big face of stone: he believes he will win the highest position of the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
They are actually attacks that don't say much; they are clearly racial attacks and they don't answer the voters' question: will he be a good president? And there are also the polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there is one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the heart of the south of the United States, has written an editorial: once in the booth to vote, we will know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the U.S. mentality is covered up until the last one.
"Whatever you want, we'll think about where to put the cross, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear: if you win Obama, we'll leave America.
things never said before, which seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
Despite all these reasonings, however, the defeating weapon for the democratics is George Bush.
They have asked 1,500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term of office? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Changes America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home kicking her ass.
In Iraq there are 4500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to make the bags.
Similarly, Iraq for the majority has been Bush's weak spot.
Whoever will take over George W's position will have a huge duty to unfold.
Usa, the economic collapse is also felt for journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, "murderer" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been interviewed by PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control for the future.
Today, however, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly declared themselves less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like once.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is an economic model crisis destroyed.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the writers work to perform the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism is not wanted as most people understand it to reduce substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that national journalism is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Counter-emission print.
It's not hard for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap on the Internet, for many views such as the "murderer" of the printed letter.
The "economic pressure" that journalists warn has increased to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have admitted that they are hugging technology in the hope "to do something good" for journalism.
The biggest breakthrough in American journalism today is between the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56 per cent of executives at the national level are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23 per cent.
For some, this has to do with "work safety".
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47 per cent at the national level.
For journalists it is 30 per cent.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work with a contract.
In an immense nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet employers often offer what they want and thus become a question of "take it or leave it".
Directors receive almost always good wages, while editors can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social insurance.
For holidays, reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, "health" followed during the year.
It's all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: ROMAN'S TRIBUNAL, DANILO COPPOLA STAYING IN GROTTAFERRAT
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is investigated by bankruptcy in the field of anti-committee investigation concerning the escalation of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the arrest process in his office, last week, he has obtained house release, transforming it into compulsory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate could travel the route of the province city to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the pm has given the opposite vote) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites at risk
The phenomenon had already been manifested a few days ago with the vote of the representatives' camera against the $700 million saving plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
Yesterday's New York Times confirms that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, always more divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "them of Washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the states of the Central and South.
The soul, in fact, has become preponderant with the vow of who spoke at first.
This is hardly an example of mutations, of major mutations, which the current economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not just here alone.
Whether in the United States or in Europe for a long time, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate are solidified and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-upgrading, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual category state-support in relation to a type of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, indeed, is a crisis of banking institutions - it would finance those that have, yes, strong relations you would finance with the outside, but above all the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
He who immediately creates a political problem for the ruler: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears economically global but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of play or they don't have much to say: the crucial test is the European Union that as always divided between different interests and different state strategies is unable to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone is expected to intervene, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the subsidy of funds: from the moment you get to court it is only the state that owns the economic resources and the mass of resources to finance you to remedy things.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization will ever be able to dispose to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis puts on the state-nation is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance as long as the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a very collapsing factor to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the ever more sophisticated technology network, the inmaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to make the accounts more and more with unmaterial things such as water, crops and oil.
All things that, look, can certainly be transported from one place to the other of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a confined space, a territory.
So whosoever finds himself sovereign, certainly possesses many more letters about who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I get to the second novelty that but predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis appears to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, of inappropriate economic kind with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain disturbing sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the countries of the West in a growing number.
It seems to go further, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the social elites so far in boom, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensible exception of the end, to have done the same time and to be more strange to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneously feeds a ramified but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of the social-democratic consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of the men of the American Congress against Bush (and layers also with the victory of the right in Italy that has something to do with it).
It has the impression that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say, make it ever more difficult to understand and then to represent, what is now taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, grows and potentially agitates in dismedition.
In the face of all this, speaking of a "rebelion of masses" today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn't.
The super glue to walk over the walls
To overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in a future walk on walls like the spider man.
It is the objective of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come close enough.
With a adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters the scientists have been able to have a body of 100 kilos stuck on a vertical wall.
THE STUDY – The American journal Science has published the discoveries of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones using a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes ordered as a spaghetti stack," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the feet of the gecos, covered with microscopic hairs that can ensure perfect adherence to the animal.
The tests made on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful of the feet of this reptile and at the same time"it easily takes off the walls" explains Liming Dai, researcher at the Engineering faculty at Dayton University.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like the spider man? Yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications might have to do with aerospace engineering.
For the moment, no superheroes.
OTHER INVESTIGATION - The University of Berkeley, in California, is also dedicating itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-cleans from dust during the movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adherence.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by increasing or decreasing, as appropriate, efficiency with serious health consequences.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packed that fresh associated with the assumption of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the current American Chemical Society to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: enough a glass of grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple to reduce the absorption of some drugs, nullifying the beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patients.
Grapefruit juice was already under accusation because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, ansiolithic, antihistamine and neurological medicinal products.
PHARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian drug agency had given the news in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mixture and to pay attention to something is being taken in the case of a drug such as Diasepam or Metadone.
NOT ONLY POMELO – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here the call by Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milano: "These discoveries are generally pointed to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of Milano.
That is why we must always read the illustrative brochures of the medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us be impressed, ask clearly the doctor or the pharmacist," stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Novel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The nobel economy award has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies, his trade models and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches Princeton University and is a New York Times publisher.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of Bush administration's decisions on economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, in those days Che broke Enron, Krugman had planned in an editorial published by the New York Times that the second event would be more determining than the first event, in the end of consequence for the United States.
A prediction that triggers a lot of controversy and that for several years has been reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed accurately.
"I'm surprised and a little upset about how the memory of Enron and Worldcom's collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public's attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the executive committee of the European central bank, Krugman is a "great-value economist", but also a "very aggressive" disseminator, particularly critical of the excesses of the liberalism of the Bush administration".
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package"anti-Microsoft"
It is the OpenOffice.org 3.0 launch day, the open source of personal productivity suite that looks to attract ever more users, from house to office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After a work of almost a year by volunteer developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several novelties: to the welcome screen and to the less rude magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as the compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and the support for the new ODF format(Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version ISO.
Attention also to the multifunction with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is in a position to open the documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows to reduce the dimension of PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via electronic post, or the possibility of importing the PDF file into the graph format module, preserving the original aspect of the page.
Always on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a sheet of calculation or a text processor.
The Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the apps: in the calculation sheet they can intervene in various users, avoiding the conflicts of changes, in the preparation of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice functions to the Web (on the cloud, on the clouds), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that was in the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request the installation cd can also be sent to home or to work.
And if the theme of free can be a hook for home dissemination, it is in the business field that Open Office the suite test, try the big bet, already able to count on several projects carried out in public administration and in schools.
And there are not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet that replaces Excel; Print, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, eats in the case of the well-known Access is the program that consents to work on the base data; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that up to now we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the departure of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Also Kohl is positive is the fourth case of doping
New positive case on the tour of France: it's the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, the team Gerolsteiner, third ranked and winner of the best climber shirt.
The news is the L'Equipe newspaper site.
Kohl, 26 years old, is the fourth positive runner to the third generation Epo, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also those of the Gerolsteiner.
The analyses of Kohl's blood champions are among those carried out in the last few weeks in the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry lab.
If the counter evidence confirms that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will anger against the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epo is the head of the French antidoping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told Associated Press that she has notified the news to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself in the podium behind the backs of Spanish Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evans, adjugating himself the best climber's shirt.
MIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES ASKED, ITALY IS RACIST?
Italy from a country of emigrant has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" hostile.
This is transforming the beautiful country into a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy on the basis of the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso who was murdered last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case shows what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those where they register "more integration and more work" but also the highest anti-immigrant feeling in the country and the highest support of the North League."
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
Also, the new legislation that the Lega wanted tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of clandestines is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope's trend is marked by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano finding Benedetto XVI in Congress has called for the State and the Church to work together to combat racism."
Students who are victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros for one room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the Sunia's latest survey, the tenants' union, renting an individual room I could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoles, 600 to Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious features to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people because of the very high costs that the family would have to sustain – explains the head of the Sunia study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities the strong demand has completely deformed the market to such a point of triggering a process of widespread growth even for the residents."
In addition, in most cases the offers of rentals contain a number of violations: free, unregistered, unlimited, sub-invoices linked.
For Sunia there is a need for extraordinary interventions which, through the revision of taxation, can regulate prices.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine and Fiera area) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and from 370 to 500 per individual.
In Rome, in central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bologna) you are asked for approximately 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
It makes economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and surrounding areas.
In Naples for a bed you are served 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinic, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you are served 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one individual.
in the cities more girls the prices are lower in absolute finishes, but it has a greater weight in the economy of the city.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of rents to students and non-Community students is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: an increase of 25/30% of the tax on foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old Paradiso cinema, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical cinema rooms close by favouring the Multiplex.
"A city without cinemas in a blind city, it's like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornatore photographer with effectively what is happening in the large Italian urban centres and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of the cinemas, which with the birth of the great methylcones in the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the monkey rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory," it is like a friend, a well-known friend who shared a piece of place and so much excitement," observes the director of the new Paradiso movie, the film that cousin Oscar won 20 years ago and the jury's great prize to Cannes, who counted the poetry of a provincial cinema room and the nostalgia for the way of living the film that he lost perhaps forever.
The figures given by the Anec, the main association of traders, speak clearly: in the last five years 316 traditional cinemas have been closed, and to pay for most are the rooms of the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 less in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are as first, Emilia-Romana with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the person responsible for his disappearance is the advent of multiplex, they are owned by these three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new methylcone films: 195 more screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 be in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romana.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," says Paolo Protti, president of the Anec," it would be useful for new structures to be built but it would be necessary to ensure that the existing ones remain, because when a city room closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the methylcones.
Not to mention the lack of funds for traders: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year."
Interestingly, the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned with the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and tutele mono cinema hall is in the historic center that in the periphery.
Among the rules envisaged are fiscal facilitation mediations for managers and advantages for the public at mobility ends: viewers will be allowed to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special parking fees.
"It is an initiative that I like," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is true, that in contrast to the extra power of methylcones, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that was always important to me: the closure of the film of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to perform the "New Paradiso cinema", which I thought for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass ahead to the Rialto or to the Quirinale via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the signs blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side."
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, the mayor of Gioia Tauro has been arrested
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to uniform the Municipality's elections for the interested to the cosque Piro model."
Heavy are the accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the intendent and vice-government of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by a mafia association.
Arrested also Gioacchino Piro model, the elder mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson's lawyer, the boss's name, already convicted of a mafia criminal association and to compensate for 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any legal and moral norms, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed the willingness to pay for consultation to lawyer Piro model.
"It would have been allowed to the mafia family – the judges write – to officially enter the inmate of the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrés regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between bad organized life are a lot" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'andrangheta, heroes who keep clean."
The arresters of this morning are added to those of last July after the police had announced the head cut of the Mafia family Piro model.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditionalities between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been left with the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, head of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot by May 2006, had been elected as head of a central right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call on the deputy minister of the interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piro model had even come to request the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "availability to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, a representative of a group very close to the Piro model clan, uniforming the public administration elections on the interests of the mafia families".
When energy comes from the waves, the big ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated site that occupies more than 70% of the planet's surface and is now discovering it, the great global energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which the big ones look like Chevron.
The possibility of collecting energy from the sea movements has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s together with the first oil crisis, the investigations were intensified.
When the price of oil fell, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was removed, but now that environmental cases and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
London's World Energy Council (WEC) estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the global electricity need could be covered by implants that exploit the wave movement of the sea.
This amount would be twice as much as that currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be currents and tides.
Giants to attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy has been Enersis, which in 2005 has sealed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away to bet on marine energy are always more and among these companies that have always voted for traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology – he has declared the spokesman of a company associated with the ha to the US colossal oiler to the Wall Street Journal economic newspaper – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question is on obtaining permission from the US Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a fairly important signal, if it is considered that in Alaska the US continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey to follow the path of the energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an interest in increase.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the start, because marine energy has no doubts that has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those Portuguese or the Scottish are of small dimensions and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce long-scale energy, a technology with greater environmental impact should be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a bonded boas system among them.
The force of the waves, which makes the boas move up and down, becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure turns a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast through submarine cables.
For now there are four implants of this kind in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces energy for a mall and for a parking lot, using submarine turbines in the East River in New York.
The movement of the water when there are tides, turns the pallets of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said that he has a long cast of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electricity, deserves the potential of tides at this time.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is especially about tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others approaching the coast, have invested $7.5 million in 2008 and an investment of $35 million is planned for 2009.
