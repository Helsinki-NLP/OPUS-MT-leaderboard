Accumulated incidence of rapid increase in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, although at different stages according to the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for a wave of patients with COVID-19 who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomerate of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei province, China.
On January 9, 2020, China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causer was a new coronavirus that is now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by the infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e. an infection of the respiratory tract with or without pneumonia, and that the majority recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves towards a more serious disease requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical disease requiring intensive care.
Mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examine trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them with those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and RU countries with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are currently following that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5 edition of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020, in persons who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 had been detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), according to which between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths had occurred in Italy only.
Obtaining the accumulated amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), reports of cases of COVID-19 reported in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculate the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA/RU country, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as at March 15, 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to that of Italy for the period from January 31 to March 15, 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
Trends in the cumulative incidence of cases of COVID-19 truncated 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that in the province of Hubei, China (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased near 28 February 2020 (complementary material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA and UK countries showed upward trends in the accumulated incidence of similar COVID-19 (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and RU countries, compared to that of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
He stressed that, at 8:00 a.m. on 15 March, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already recorded a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increasing in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This is so despite the different stages in which countries are located, variations in national public health responses and, possibly, different case definitions in countries and different protocols to select patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions to COVID-19 cases in a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (no data are shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to supplement the current monitoring data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a great variation in the availability of intensive care beds and intermediate care in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds and intermediate care per 100 000 inhabitants in 2010–11).
Model scenarios in relation to the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and RU of the prevalence of hospitalization cases by COVID-19 associated with a risk >90 % overtake of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid ECDC risk assessment on COVID-19.
Since cases have so far been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA and RU countries, and hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy's experience and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should therefore be prepared for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who require medical care and, in particular, intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, since the rapid increase expected in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals sufficient time to understand, accept and adapt their response in a manner consistent with the failure to implement it in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists the public health measures necessary to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief period of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to deepen their control efforts to halt the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care over the next few days and weeks.
The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3,000 people and has infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere around the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
In a similar way to its counterpart virus, SARS-CoV, which provoked SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bat and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more communicable and affects older people than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and complete analysis of the topic of research, which is rapidly developed.
We will deal with the basic aspects of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still have no answer, we hope that this analysis will help to understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Party of January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and unbearable memory for all Chinese, who were urged to stay at home throughout the festival and for several more weeks due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, on February 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) called it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and spread rapidly throughout the country and to nearly 50 more countries worldwide.
As at 2 March 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number 1" and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19, including their virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the multiple patient isolated virus.
The aim of this analysis is to summarize the progress made in research on this new subject that is rapidly developing.
When possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about disease prevention and forecasting, as well as some critical questions that have not yet been answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens for humans, mainly causing about 15% of common colds 4.
However, in this century, we have found ourselves twice with highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which originally caused an outbreak in China in 2003, and in Saudi Arabia, in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with scary morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is the third coronavirus that is recorded in the history of humanity.
As shown in fig. 1,1 pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of health care providers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was quarantined and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the site of origin of the infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 more countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation evolves rapidly, the final dimension and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly persons aged 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of infected persons were over 50 years old, very few had less than 20 and only 14 infected persons were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 expanded into conglomerates mostly in Hubei and its surroundings.
On average, there were 5 days (2-9) between the appearance and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from apparition to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The basic reproductive number (R0) was 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and the adjusted R0 was 2,23-4,82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially by 23 January 2020, which coincides with the era of massive mobilization prior to the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of confirmed patients was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86 %), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06 % (95% CI: 2.02-4.59 %).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronaviruses are a subfamily of large and enveloped viruses containing a unique-sensitive RNA.
They can be divided into four genres, i.e. alpha, beta, range and delta, of which alphacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus are those that infect humans.
Spice glycoprotein (S) of the wrapping binds to its cell receptors, the converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released to cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of nucleocapside, a vein form containing virions, which then merge with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on January 10, 2020.
It was found that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99.98 % in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original site of the outbreak: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
The SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to the SARS-CoV than the MERS-CoV.
With an electronic transmission microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra-slim sections of the human respiratory epithelial.
Human ACE2 was found to be a SARS-CoV-2 receptor, as well as SARS-CoV receptor.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weaker than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in viral pathogenicity and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional motive.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the electronic cryomycroscopy structure of the full-length human ACE2 in resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed configurations, was assembled as a dimer, and that the complex ACE2-B0AT1 can unite two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and coronavirus infection.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for the drug study in order to suppress the SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and Intermediate Guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96 % to two coronaviruses similar to the SARS of bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the barrier of the species to infect humans, and it remains to dilute the transmission route.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as bat virus carriers to humans, which involved homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers from Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolines (long-snap mammals that feed ants and are usually used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % spread by all two genomes remains a great difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Fig. 33).
The physical chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at less than 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50 %.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75 % ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, percloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity from SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
To date, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Therefore, we can only resort to previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
In general, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectine receptors, Toll-type receptors (TLRs), NOD-type receptors (NLRs) and RIG-I-type receptors (RLRs).
Through different pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophageal fagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV N protein can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response is added to the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Cooperative T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to help defense cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity, which includes supplements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, the isolated antibodies of a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exaggerated reaction from the immune system generates locally a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organic failure and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the appearance in conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised are more likely to become infected than others.
The estimated mean of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period is 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adapt effective quarantine time depending on the most accurate incubation period; this is how asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine extend to 24 days?
The fever is usually the main and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnoea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, throat pain, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after the disease occurred.
In severe cases, patients evolved rapidly to developing acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory fever or symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnoea and 3 % for diarrhoea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by the transmission of an asymptomatic person.
In a comparable way, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47 %) and dyspnoea (55 %) as major symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and in line with the higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that fever (99-100 %), dry cough (29-75 %), dyspnoea (40-42 %), diarrhoea (20-25 %) and throat pain (13-25 %) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was needed in approximately 14 % to 20 % of patients.
By 14 February, the mortality rate of COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66 576 worldwide.
Similarly, SARS mortality by November 2002 was 10 % in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, it was reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and was raised to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95 % from 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only varied between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in table 1.1.
The previous figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than those of the latter two.
Therefore, it is much more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than those of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in conglomerates usually occurs within the same family or from the same assembly or vehicle, like a cruise.
Patients usually have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in the two weeks prior to the appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from the hospital can get the virus back, an alarm signal that quarantine time should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of white blood cells in peripheral blood (especially lymphocytes) at the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia was observed with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and the reactive protein C and erythrocytic sedimentation were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the dimer-D level, a product of fibrin degradation in the blood, was high, and the count of lymphocytes was progressively reduced.
Anomalies are detected in the thoracic x-rays of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or opacity in bilateral glazed glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis severely affect gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocite dysfunction decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings in thoracic x-rays are usually in parallel with the maximum severity of the disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decay of pneumocites, the formation of a hyalin membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstice, and multinucleated syncitial cells in the lungs of a patient who died because of the disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral infection and SDRA, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by a chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (which was no longer based solely on RT-PCR) were started in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for the use of the SHERLOCK technique based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA to between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microlitre of sample) using a graduated rod within an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if checked in clinical samples.
Due to lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors can mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, while testing with a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed before for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (table 2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, recovered patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use the plasma of patients recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to see who first develops antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
The SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the lungs at first and, probably, also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs expressing the ACE2, such as those of the digestive apparatus and the kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory insufficiency are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need assistance from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of potentially fatal heart or respiratory insufficiency.
In addition, maintaining electrolytic balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting the functions of vital organs are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an exaggerated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release a huge number of free radicals that are the main cause of the SDRA and the multi-organic failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an antireceptor monoclonal antibody of IL6, have been used to treat the cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for the cytokine storm are the modulation of the immune response directed by T cells; the blocking of IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; a suppressor of cytokine signalling route 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressors, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, in particular osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, prudent use of corticosteroids at low-to-moderate doses has been recommended for a short period of time for patients with critical COVID-19.
The efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed at the time of this analysis.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotid analogue, given intravenously in an American patient with COVID-19, has been verified.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other viruses with monocatenary RNA, such as MERS and SARS.
On the basis of these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to carry out a couple of trials in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma of recovered patients and antibody generation
Blood extraction from patients who recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy people so that they do not contract the disease is not something new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies to the pathogen in the blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B lymphocytes to combat pathogens and other strange objects, and recognize certain molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, blood plasma was extracted from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected to 10 severely ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and a better saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, it is necessary to verify and clarify this to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which may cause fatal toxicity.
Blood antibodies concentration is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat critical patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or seek effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to the theories of the MCT.
Most effective components remain unknown or inaccurate, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The main recovery rates in the treatment of patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China that used MCT in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50 %) and Hunan (50 %), while the province of Hubei, which used MCT in only about 30% of its patients with COVID-19, had the lowest recovery rate (13 %).
However, this is a fairly approximate comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the amount and severity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and his colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine treatment (MO) only with the combined treatment of MO and MCT.
They found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group alone.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO group only (8.8% versus 39 %).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MCT are still awaiting more well-controlled tests at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and determine the effective components of the treatments of the MCT or its combinations if possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 are generally very afraid of highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, the symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as the adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may cause more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric morbidities were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Tracking contacts and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the outbreak of COVID-19, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, suspects and people in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the transmission chain of animal and human reservoirs infected to susceptible guests, and they often complement antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop protein-based S vaccines to generate powerful and long-term neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Live virus vaccines attenuated in animal models for SARS have been evaluated.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in older people and the models of lethal stimulation and their protection from zoonotic virus infection should still be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because the SARS was extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been recorded since then.
On the other hand, there are still cases and conglomerates of MERS sporadicly in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune people is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As it is a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can gradually recover without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a model of forecast for disease is essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS forecasting, which is also successful for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years in a 8866 case study, as described above.
Patients who required intensive care most likely had underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably higher than those who did not require them (average age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor in the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require more likely intensive care suffer from acute heart injury and arrhythmia.
Heart events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be associated with positive ACE2 cholangiocytes, which may cause hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that the underlying age and diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: Reactive C protein level (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognosis factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation between the level of RCP and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, a high level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) can also help predict the patient's evolution.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when the tissue is damaged.
They therefore constitute traditional markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest X-ray and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for predicting clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Using steroids: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjuvant therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since the use of high doses of corticosteroids was extended in patients with severe SARS, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: as described above, during the outbreak of COVID-19, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods of quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and attended the death of close relatives and other patients.
It is essential to provide long-term psychotherapy and support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from those of SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tracts, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicated efficiently in the upper respiratory tracts and cause mild symptoms or does not cause symptoms at the early stage of the infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected with early or incubation may produce a large number of viruses during their daily activities, making it enormously difficult to control the epidemic.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, while the transmission was mostly not occurring in the early phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is much more serious and difficult to control than the outbreak of SARS.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have caused significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be completed by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than the SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and had left the hospital two weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, promising signals have been seen in China given the decrease in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Originally, Ebola was predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through strict quarantine and isolation, disease control has been achieved.
Like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may be weakened in terms of infection and eventually extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is provided below (fig. (fig. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 is highly communicable through cough or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the faeces, which poses a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases may have been caused by infections in nosocomies, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 providers of medical care.
Therefore, precautions should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family workers, colleagues, and even transients in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and masks with respirator N95 (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent a potentially infected person's liquid drips from being transmitted by the air or adhering to the surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to others.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5 % of virions can penetrate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measures about 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical care providers should use custom-made insulation bats to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite using a N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, health care providers should also use protective caps or transparent glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, try to stay at home in voluntary quarantine and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet are considered to be a suitable distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, reportedly on January 7, 2020, should have caused great warning in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was only on January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Center reassured citizens saying that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message greatly relaxed the public's alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Party, and the critical moment to contain the disease at a minimum level in Wuhan was missed.
Agencies for disease control in China should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, as each word matters to citizens and can make them change their attitudes or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than expecting the formal reports of doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive to contain a possible epidemic at their early stage, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective simulations to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the society's response system periodically.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and about 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the outbreak of COVID-19 has generated the sense of reappearance of SARS.
However, there are some notorious differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to containing the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and more men than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older persons than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even if they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do so when they are severely ill, resulting in a much greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 compared to SARS.
This explains in part why the SARS-CoV-2 spread much faster and more widespread than the SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients may be positive in the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a number of important issues remain to be resolved, such as:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two bat coronaviruses similar to SARS, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus of the original host, let's say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to numbers 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively slow the transmission, and the outbreak can resurgence at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ECE2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is not possible to achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically while transmitted among humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, extinct as the SARS or resurgence regularly as the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and many others.
However, no matter what it costs, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
Zonotic origins of human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have encouraged the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild diseases, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (MERS) have reversed the coin by revealing how devastating and fatal a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 put the coronavirus in the center of attention again and surprised us with a high communicability and reduced pathogenicity compared to his brother, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses have their origin in bats, where they are not pathogens.
Intermediate reservoir guests of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying animal guests has direct implications in the prevention of diseases in humans.
Researching the interactions between coronaviruses and guests in animals could also throw important information about the pathogenicity of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as on their zoonotic origins and on the transmission between species.
Notablely, we compare and contrast the different human coronaviruses from the perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current disease epidemic for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful guest changes and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
The coronaviruses belong to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of positive monocatenary RNA viruses with wrapping.
These viruses, which host the largest genome, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were called "coronavirus" due to their morphology, because of the shape of crown they have under an electronic microscope.
As for its structure, coronaviruses have non-segmental genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicate polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, nsp1~16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spike (S), wrapping (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific adjacent proteins of each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genres (alfacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus of betacoronaviruses contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the source of genes of most alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses, while birds are the main reservoir of gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed the barriers of species and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronavirus.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonar manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretion of patients with common cold in the middle of the 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge was accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, even the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that human coronavirus infection is usually harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in today's history and infected more than 8000 people, with a rough lethality of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic on the Arabian peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later called SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing disease epidemic by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been charged more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91 000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been ringing and the world must prepare for the approaching SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and are not pathogens, but have a great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracking the zoonotic origins of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and the factors of restriction of jumping between species.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate animal guests and amplifiers of the SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in preventing the spread in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of zoonotic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogenia of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlight and analyse the common theme that the parent viruses of human coronaviruses are normally not pathogens in their guests of natural reservoirs, but become pathogens after the transmission of species to a new host.
We also examine the trend of evolution of human coronaviruses, in which increased communicability usually leads to a decrease in pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also analysed in this context.
The coronavirus of animals has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first isolate of HCoV-229E strain B814 of the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In recent decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discoveries of human coronaviruses in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in cell lines WI-38 of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of common cold, such as headache, sneezing, general discomfort and throat pain, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ cultivation and the subsequent serious passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of other respiratory pathogen infections, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed around the world and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunosuppressed patients had a severe lower respiratory tract infection.
The SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", caused the first pandemic caused by a well documented human coronavirus in the history of humanity, and the etiological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus that was discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread over many countries and continents.
Apart from superpropagants, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the maximum viral load at the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, general discomfort and chills, followed by dyspnoea, cough and respiratory difficulty as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, altered liver function and high level of kinase creatinine are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
In addition to the lower respiratory tracts, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tube, liver and kidney, can also be infected in these serious cases, usually accompanied by a storm of cytokines, which could be fatal, particularly in immunodepressed patients.
The virus was first isolated from the biopsy from open to heaven from a relative of the initial patient who travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child from the Netherlands by the end of 2004.
Initially, it was determined that it was predominant in young children, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of cork, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the insulation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum incidence occurs at the beginning of summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchialitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community pneumonia and bronchialitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was worldwide and caused mild respiratory diseases.
These four human coronaviruses acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans and, in general, are less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, as in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe infection of lower respiratory tracts in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to be efficiently transmitted and continuously maintained in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the confirmed cases in the laboratory are originating in the Middle East, cases have been reported with occasional contagion to close contacts in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of the MERS are similar to those of the SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed acute renal insufficiency, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronavirus.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2500 confirmed cases were recorded in a laboratory, with a high lethality of 34.4 %, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses for humans known to be.
From mid-to-end December 2019, conglomerates of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international importance and, in addition, called the disease COVID-19.
As at 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2 %, while outside it is 1.2 %.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which occurs as fever, cough and dyspnoea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can evolve rapidly to acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a 82 % high nucleotide sequence homology, they are categorized in different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogen, but more communicable compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to their rapid spread worldwide.
When comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of the disease by human coronavirus are very similar.
In this regard, the SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between that of SARS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most frequently observed in human coronavirus infections acquired in the community, including non-specific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns of both the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community and the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of the human coronavirus acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it remains to verify whether the transmissionability of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passes between humans, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 performs an important function, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least under some circumstances, it should still be diluted in future studies.
It is also of particular interest to find out whether the SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with the coronaviruses of humans acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human passes, will have an influence on the final outcome of the current outbreak of COVID-19.
The four human coronaviruses acquired in the community that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it could also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious diseases in humans and humans who developed serious human coronavirus diseases have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must be replicated in humans to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract the limitation factors of the host.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people infected, the greater the likelihood it will be fully adapted to humans.
If well adapted, their human transmission would be difficult to stop through quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four coronaviruses acquired in the community have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and highly pathogenic MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission between humans is unsustainable.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to spread to susceptible human objectives, possibly through one or more intermediate guests and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four human coronaviruses acquired in the community.
It is highly communicable as the human coronavirus acquired in the community, at least for the moment.
However, it is more pathogen than human coronaviruses acquired in the community and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see if it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without an animal host of reservoir or intermediate.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be useful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate and amplifier guests of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary guest of a human coronavirus if it hosts a closely related ancestor who shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not pathogen in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host houses a human coronavirus on a continuous and long-term basis.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are natural guests of human coronavirus or their parent virus.
Instead, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time as its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogen.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the host amplifier function by allowing the virus to replicate temporarily and then transmit to humans to amplifi the scale of human infection.
A human coronavirus can cause an infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
On the contrary, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and, even, generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate guest becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Civets of masked palm trees (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog in live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were recorded after killing all the civets on the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild masked palm trees or of unexposed farms to the markets of live animals were mostly negative in SARS-CoV, suggesting that the civets of masked palm trees would only act as an intermediate amplifier host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notablely, since 80 % of different animals in Guangzhou's markets have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate SARS-CoV amplifier guests cannot be ruled out.
They all seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
Subsequent searches of the natural animal host of the SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, called the CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus bat related to the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese knight bats.
These bats are positive in anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the sequencing of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome.
This and other bat coronavirus share a 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for the new concept that bats host emerging pathogens in humans.
Several coronaviruses similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as living virus.
Human enzyme converter of angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a fecal bat sample uses the ACE2 of bats, civets and humans as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, serums of patients with convalescent SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, the WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of the SARS-CoV in bats, which shares a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate host of SARS-CoV reservoir.
According to the phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 bat and the CoV-HKU5 bat.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
Polymerase RNA sequences dependent on MERS-CoV RNAs are phylogenetically closer to their identified bat betacoronavirus counterparts in Europe and Africa.
So far, a MERS-CoV living in wild bats cannot be found.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 bat, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate host of the MERS-CoV reservoir.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive in neutralizing MERS-CoV antibodies specifically, as well as camels originating in the Middle East in several African countries.
A living MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the dromedary nasal exudate, which supports even more that camels act as bona fide reserve guests of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms were observed, but a massive spread of the virus in camels infected for MERS-CoV research.
Notably, infected camels spread the virus not only by respiratory means, but also by fecal-oral means, which is also the main route of bat virus spread.
However, there are still questions, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no contact history with camels before the symptoms appear, which is reasonably attributed to the transmission between humans or unknown transmission routes involving unrecognised animal species hosting MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parent relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir guests of the SARS-CoV-2 unless they are in the future virtually identical bat coronavirus.
Presumably, intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species that are sold and killed in Huanan's wholesale seafood market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolines (Manis javanica), could also host ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangoline coronavirus share an 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of around 90 % at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sublinings of viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4 % amino acid sequence identity.
In marked contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a higher degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolines also reported the detection of viral counts in lung samples, which prove to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of assembling and manual healing to generate a partial genome sequence that comprised about 86.3% of the full-length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangoline is one of the intermediate animal guests of the SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence that supports a direct origin in the pangoline of the SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence divergence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangoline betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between the SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 is even lower than that between the SARS-CoV-2 and the pangoline betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolines and other mammals should still be established.
Although the highest sequencing homology was found in the RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangoline, the betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the pangoline betacoron viruses related to the SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between the pangoline betacoron viruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animal.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is extended among betacoronaviruses.
No conclusion has yet been reached on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have been derived from bat coronavirus, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
It was reported that a coronavirus of bats called ARCoV.2 (coronavirus of the Apalaches Mountains) detected in a tricolor bat in North America had a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelides have also been suspected as intermediate guests.
For greater clarity, the knowledge to date of the animal origins of known human coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of events of transmission of human coronavirus between species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock animals in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was recorded.
The transmission history between HCoV-229E species is not so accurately known.
Bat alphacoronavirus has been found closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alphacoronavirus.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of bat virus to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans could have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Instead, humans have close contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphacoronaviruses related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphacoronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility of alpacas acquiring human alphacoronavirus related to HCoV-229E cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogen viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising for bats to transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as a genetic acquis of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate guests transmitting the virus to humans, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of transmission between species, bats to dromedaries, and dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by later findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a profuse stock of virus species, to the exchange of genetic fragments between species and to the transmission between species.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and great ability to fly, are all favourable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus propeller".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It is well adapted to these camels, which have become an intermediate guest, to be a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as the transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolines, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangoline betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangoline.
They may be a terminal host of the betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2, as are the civets in the case of the SARS-CoV.
Various possibilities of transmission between SARS-CoV-2 species from animals to humans should be confirmed or excluded in future studies.
First, bats could be the host of a reservoir of a SARS-CoV-2-related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through the massacre or coal mining.
Second, pangolines could be one of the intermediate amplifiers in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of antibodies in domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolines.
The search for the animal origins of the SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal guests, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating that coronavirus crosses the barriers of the species.
First, its relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, estimated coronavirus mutation rates could be considered "moderate" to "high", with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 substitutes per year, per site 2, according to the phase of adaptation of coronavirus to new guests.
The coronaviruses have an exorribonuclease reading check, the elimination of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inviability.
Interestingly, it is known that the nucleotid analogue remdesivir suppresses the replication of coronavirus by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, coronavirus mutation rates are about a million times higher than those of their guests.
In addition, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of human adaptation.
It is to be hoped that it has already been adapted to another guest close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, genetic derivation is unlikely to make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 quickly lose effectiveness.
Secondly, the long RNA genome of the coronaviruses exercises additional plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombination and thus increases the probability of coevolution among species, which encourages the emergence of new coronaviruses when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by unique open reading frameworks and the functions of codified proteins towards direction 3' of the genome.
Thirdly, coronaviruses change randomly and often templates during RNA replication through a single "copy-choice" mechanism.
In a guest who acts as a mixing vehicle, the chain change is often occurring during the RNA transcription of the coronavirus.
Full-length RNAs and highly homogeneous subgenomics could be recombinant to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronavirus, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that influences the interspecies transmission.
In the present, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed positive selection in inter-species transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between isolated strains of human and civet SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV is believed to experience rapid adaptation in different guests, in particular with mutations in protein S RBD.
In general, the RBD of a coronavirus protein S interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host's antibody response.
In the SARS-CoV, the RBD is found in amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to the human ACE2 and its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize the ACE2 receptors of several animals, including bat, civet, mouse and raccoon dog, which allows the transmission between species of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only 6 residues of amino acids were different from the isolate strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are in the cause of binding to the receptor for interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
The Cyvet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the interaction of the spike protein with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acids could be essential for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30 % difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in unit S1 of protein S implies that the affinity of binding of protein S with human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electronic cryomycroscopy study indicates the affinity 10 to 20 times greater of this union compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether any other correceptor might be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, the HCoV-NL63 also joins the ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses to humans, after the transmission between species from their animal guests.
In addition to cell receptors, the result of the transmission between species of human coronavirus is also determined by other dependency and restriction factors of the host.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and guests of natural reservoirs of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute an obstacle to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp the guest's dependency factors and subvert the guest's restriction factors to make the transmission between species successful.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of viral-host interaction should still be identified and characterized.
A full objective genome research of the dependency and restriction factors of the host for SARS-CoV-2 could be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronavirus appearance: starting from scratch
The diversity of bat coronavirus provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic heritage of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and constitute two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein encoder genes have the potential to drastically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the adjacent proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 has been considered to be important in human adaptation, as bat viruses related to SARS-CoV were isolated, but divergent ORF8 proteins were found to be encoded.
A 29-nucleotide elimination characteristic of SARS-CoV was found in isolated strains at the start of the epidemic in humans.
This removal divides the ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes the change of guests.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase RNA.
Recombination locations were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the Epidemic MERS-CoV suffered recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, where human coronaviruses are recombinant with other animal coronaviruses in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, which most likely results in the release of viruses from the selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to the elimination of two nucleotides.
Although an intact ORF4 was observed in bat viruses and camels related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphacoronavirus presents a single nucleotide insertion, resulting in a change of framework.
Lastly, although not least, the evolution of new human coronaviruses is also driven by the selection pressure in its reservoir guests.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats are apparently well adapted to anatomical and physiological coronaviruses.
For example, defects in activating the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the positive regulation of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitor receptor and the low level of expression of class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactionary oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress the replication of the coronavirus and affect the reading check of exorribonuclease, which brings the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced to a new host.
More pathogenic coronavirus strains could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation to the host.
It is therefore no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir guests, such as bats and camels.
They are strongly replicated without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
In this lies the secrets of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes serious cases of infection in humans.
Serious symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of the immune response and the storm of cytokines, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response has dissociated itself from the coronavirus replication.
The same strategy of delinking immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is especially strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SRS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, inhibition of inflammasome NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the appearance of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat betacoronavirus has been found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals on the markets have been found to have viruses identical to SARS-CoV, immediate intermediate guests of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Betacoron viruses of pangoline have been found to be significantly similar to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangoline could act as one of the intermediate guests or that betacoron viruses of pangoline could contribute fragments of genes to the final version of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 is made by man either deliberately or by accident.
The coronaviruses have recovered from the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of human coronaviruses in human transmission.
vast evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate guests.
Since the SARS-CoV infection originates in contact between humans and civets in the markets, closing the wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolines should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, given the discovery of several pangoline betacoronavirus lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammals remains to be diluted in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in the dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool, as well as a main source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed by the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurring outbreaks of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes that cause outbreaks may appear.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses are circulating in wild state.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are great possibilities for these zoonotic coronaviruses to evolve and recommence, which would lead to the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more communicable or more deadly in humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to spread is presented.
Although bats have many characteristics that favour the spread of viruses, human contact opportunities with bats and other wild species can be minimized if the population is educated to get away from them.
Continuous mammal surveillance is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural guests, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to humans and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is to keep humans away from ecological niches from the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces are still missing in the zoonotic origin puzzle of the SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolines, it will be interesting to analyze in what circumstances bats and pangolines could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in human transmission, it must be determined how humans come into contact with bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal acts as the real intermediate host, it must be determined how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, could be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, monitoring and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether a bat, a pangoline or another mammal, it is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural guests in the future.
Continuous research in this area will dilute the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick advice guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronavirus infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and is a good reference to combating this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to a commentary on our guideline and provided the most recent diagnostic criteria of "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick advice guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on February 06, 2020.
He's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge gradually increase on the basis of the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), from 16 January 2020 to 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our guideline received a comment from Zhou et al., presented a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence for our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic around the world.
We support your important work and express our gratitude.
However, your work also needs to be updated according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspicious case it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological background characteristics with two points of clinical manifestations to make a thorough analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be met if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological background: (1) history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in the city of Wuhan and the surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the occurrence of symptoms; (4) history of contact with confirmed cases groups (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas, such as home, office, one school class, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics in photos of COVID-19 infection; (3) total counts of white blood cells showing a normal, decreased or reduced count of lymphocytes at the early start stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with some pathogenic or serological test characteristics as follows: (1) real-time positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) sequence of the complete viral genome showing high homogeneity to the recognized new coronavirus; (3) positive result for the specific IgM antibody and the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of the specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or an increase of the title ≥4 times more in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the real-time polymerase chain reaction test to detect nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory tracts was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then the serological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, more and more evidence reminds us that we must have prudence with asymptomatic and atypical symptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. flow diagram should be updated as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The rating system should also be verified in other clinical studies and practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will arise and we ask readers to send their comments to us.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we recommend looking for and complying with the newest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the largest number in one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 yesterday in one day.
It's the largest number of deaths in a day due to the virus.
Until yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported that the number of infected cases registered included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases that were remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two between 51 and 60 years old and one between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were Daca's.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic.
One hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news media, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being attended by the Kuwaiti Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video ad, the Minister of Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This suspension of public transport had initially begun on 26 March and was expected to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still permitted.
The first reported cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men returned from Italy and also the woman of one of them.
As at 19 March, these three had already recovered.
Over a million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections SARS-CoV-2 exceeded one million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malaui confirmed his first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea stated, on Thursday, that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases at 24 hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central Time (UTC-0800), on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were reported, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing Johns Hopkins University data, that on Wednesday there were over 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavirus infections.
Throughout the world, countries announced stricter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's closure until May 1.
At the national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to earn their wages without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the state of emergency 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina throughout the day; previously, curfews were held only between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its order to stay home until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia Lower the Limits of Hygienic Paper per Transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and a package per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the limit of a package.
These limitations were published as messages on the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
Consumers were reported to be supplying themselves for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited purchases of toilet paper for home delivery to a package on order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, with the application of the restriction of four packages, "many supermarkets still exhaust the product within one hour of delivery," and said that the demand "has no precedent", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unprecedented".
Sales went up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco Supermarket in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI made stocks available for a special offer on Wednesday planned in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers try to increase stocks, but the local council restrictions on truck delivery schedules make it difficult.
Predict an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets cannot make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report at News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail sales expert at Queensland University of Technology, said supermarkets supply stocks every night.
He stressed that hygienic paper is a bulky article, which causes a low amount of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a wide space empty in the shelves, which intensifies the sense of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [that] if there was an abundant amount of the article in the shelves, if products such as toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could [buy] and there were large quantities, probably the panic would be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
Recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that the stocks were exhausted.
Kimberly-Clark, who manufactures the Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, who manufactures Sorbent, noted that they were working 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to maintain the supply, according to the report at News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property vendors offered free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were made because buyers had free time on the long week's Worker's Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed on Darwin, included an eight-page letter designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
The supermarkets at first were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to an ABC Australia report of 3 March, in which they said they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, including masks, disinfectant, dry products, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was observed that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of toilet paper Andres to two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares the pandemic of COVID-19
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared pandemic the current outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
While the word "pandemic" refers only to the extent of the spread of a disease, not to how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general.
We are very concerned, both about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and about the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States, the pandemic "is unprecedented".
In statements published by CNN in February, he stated, "in addition to influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from the appearance to the continuing global spread."
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar opinion, and said "never before have we seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus."
"And we had never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemic condition arises following the WHO decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about the outbreak, "in conclusion, it's going to get worse."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic 2019–20 is an ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency on 30 January 2020, and was recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories, and about 97 000 deaths as a result.
About 364 000 people recovered.
It was estimated that the rate of lethality per case is 4 % in China, whereas globally it ranges from 13.04 % in Algeria to 0.08 % in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptoms, usually, is about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include washing hands, covering your mouth when coughing, keeping distance from others and controlling and insulation of people suspected of being infected.
The authorities around the world responded through the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard controls and closures of facilities.
The pandemic caused serious global socio-economic alteration, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and the widespread shortage of supplies aggravated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Wrong information on the virus was disseminated on the Internet, and incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other persons of descent and appearance in East and South-East Asia, and others in areas with significant cases of viruses were reported.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of unknown cause of pneumonia, and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
Most cases were related to Huanan's wholesale seafood market, so the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangoline coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person who was found to manifest symptoms was sick on December 1, 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last group of the wet market.
In the first group of cases reported in December 2019, two thirds were found to have a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that, a case dating back to 17 November 2019 from a 55-year-old Hubei province could have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases reportedly decreased in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As at 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under represented 2.4% of cases worldwide. Patrick Vallance, the UK's main scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective collective immunity could be achieved.
The cases relate to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 tests, and who obtained a positive result confirmed according to official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests in more than 3% of its population, and many countries had formal policies not to carry out tests in people who had only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unregistered infections were the source of infection of 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the amounts of infections in Italy were significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time from the development of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being the most common 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97 000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as at 5 February, about 80% of deaths belonged to people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official records of deaths by the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to the deceased who gave positive COVID test, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the number of actual deaths due to COVID-19 may be much higher, as people who died may not be included without testing, for example, in their homes, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the amount of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of deaths by COVID in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of reported deaths] is a underestimation," a statement corroborated by the anecdotal subcontinuation reports in the U.S.. This underestimation is common in pandemics, such as in the H1N1 swine influenza pandemic of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside continental China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
As at 28 February, outside continental China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As at 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several indicators are generally used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary depending on the region and over time, and are influenced by the number of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time spent since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the world's proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0% (97 039/1 617 204) as at 10 April 2020.
The number varies depending on the region.
In China, estimates of deaths in cases decreased from 17.3% (in those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the rate of lethality by cases, which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who died as a result of a disease, and the rate of lethality by infections, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died as a result of a disease.
These statistics do not have a specified time frame and consider a specific population from the infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The University of Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the rate of death for pandemic infections as a whole is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The higher estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first random tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on the estimates of the rate of lethality by case.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ depending on location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decrease when the disease is left without available guests.
But, right now, it's almost impossible to make a reasonable forecast of when that will happen."
The main medical adviser of the Chinese Government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it could end in June" if all countries could be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that the SARS-CoV-2 "will be circulating, possibly for one or two years."
According to the study of the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine (possibly 18 months or more) is available".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus, since it's so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "may become a seasonal disease, which will reappear every year."
The virulence of resurgence would depend on collective immunity and the magnitude of mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88 %) and dry cough (68 %).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum production in respiratory tracts (flemma), loss of sense of smell, lack of air, muscle pain and joints, throat pain, headache, chills, vomiting, haemoptisis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is severely ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centers (CDCs), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pressure or persistent chest pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and blueing in the face or lips; in the event of these symptoms, immediate medical care is recommended. Increased progression of the disease may lead to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory difficulty syndrome, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not presenting clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore, researchers advised to monitor and examine closely those who have close contact with confirmed infected persons in order to rule out the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (time between infection and symptoms) covers one to 14 days; more often it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at first was 30% and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is believed to spread mainly during close contact and through the small drops that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when coughing without covering the mouth, droplets can be moved from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small drops that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking. Breath drops may also occur during exhalation, even when speaking, although, usually, the virus is not transmitted by air.
Droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people who are close or possibly inhaled into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR), can cause the aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air spread.
You can also spread when you touch a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it can be transmitted through faeces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese Government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the symptoms appear, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms are manifested and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People obtained positive results in disease tests up to three days before symptoms occurred, indicating that transmission is possible before developing significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asymptomatic transmission during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although the ease with which the disease is spread is not completely clear, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus survives from hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, one day in cardboard and up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies depending on humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests of COVID-19 made to pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have touched infected people.
The coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes into contact with soap, which dissolves its protective wrapper. The SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that coronavirus is genetically grouped with the genus betacoronavirus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the level of the complete genome, it is 96 % identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangoline viruses and human viruses.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the pangoline coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share up to 92 % of the genetic material, which is not enough to prove that pangoline is the intermediary host.
Virus infection can be diagnosed provisionally on the basis of symptoms, although, ultimately, it is confirmed by the chain reaction of polymerase with reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computerized tomography.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which the chain reaction of polymerase was compared with computerized tomography, computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not using computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually, this test is performed with a nasopharyngeal hysop, although a throat hysop can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of these proved to be accurate enough for its widespread use to be approved.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-rays and CT images of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral opacity glass opacity and absent pleural spills.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an online international database of the results obtained in confirmed case images.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, the diagnosis of unconfirmed images by chain reaction of polymerase has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A comprehensive study conducted in China compared the results of thorax CT scans with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although the image diagnosis is less specific to the infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting that it is considered as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutionary neuronal networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus characteristics in images, both with X-rays and computer tomography.
Strategies to prevent the transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing your hands, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with your hands without washing them before, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who might already be infected use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to prevent transmission, and many Governments have restricted or disregarded all non-essential travel from and to countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the community spread phase in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some members of the community do not know where or how they were infected. It is recommended that medical care providers who care for someone who might be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and use eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the origin of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by Governments for this purpose has generated concerns about privacy, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement to demand limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and as at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of one user to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they were in close contact with someone who gave positive in the COVID-19 test. Wrong ideas are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouth rinse gargaras are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Handwashing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDCs recommend that people wash their hands often with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when they have visiblely dirty hands; before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies when it comes to contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
CDCs also recommended using an alcohol-based hand disinfectant with at least 60% volume alcohol when no soap and water are available.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose or mouth with their hands without washing them before.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 62–71 % ethanol, 50–100 % isopropanol, 0,1 % sodium hypochlorite, 0.5 % hydrogen peroxide and 0,2–7,5 % iodine povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDCs recommend that, if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed on an installation, such as an office or day care facility, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and automatic ATMs that have been used by sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with their elbow flexed or with a disposable handkerchief to cough or sneeze, and that they discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected use surgical masks, as the use of a mask may limit the volume and distance travelled by the respiratory droplets that disperse when speaking, sneezing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce the tendency [from] people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection without proper hand hygiene." It has also been recommended to use masks in people who care for someone who might have the disease.
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example those who take care of a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by the public.
In the US, CDCs recommend using non-medical fabric masks. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when they are in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends using a surgical mask to take public transport or be in crowded places.
Thai health officials recommend that people make fabric masks in their homes and wash them on a daily basis.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbade to go to public spaces without using a mask or without covering their nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask when they are in public spaces to protect themselves and protect others.
The Austrian Government demanded the use of masks by all people entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents use masks in public.
Taiwan, which has manufactured ten million masks per day since mid-March, on 1 April demanded the use of masks by passengers on inter-urban trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to leave outdoors, while it also recommends the manufacture of masks made at home from those who cannot buy them.
The masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) includes measures for the control of infection designed to curb the spread of the disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can implement social distance methods by staying in their homes, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using health forms that do not include contact and physically distance from others.
Many governments now demand or recommend social distance in regions affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Elderly adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory diseases, hypertension and compromised immune systems have a greater risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and CDCs recommend staying in their homes as much as possible in the areas of the community affected by the outbreak. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health agencies began to replace the use of the term "social distance" with "physical distance" to clarify that the objective is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt full social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in contact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have published guidelines on sexual health to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a person who is living with, who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of being infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions on adequate insulation, and many Governments have demanded or recommended autoquarantine of entire populations in the affected areas.
The stricter autoquarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to do autoquarantine for 14 days from the moment of the last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
The containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is intended to identify and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are moved to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to curb the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures can be adopted at the same time.
Deletion requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the basic number of reproduction to less than 1. Part of controlling the outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to reduce the epidemic peak, which is known as flatening the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk that health services will collapse and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, use of masks and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling mass concurrence events; community commitment to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning. In China, more drastic measures aimed at containing the outbreak were taken once their severity became evident, for example, the implementation of quarantines in whole cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass detection and localized quarantine assessments, and issued alerts on the movements of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies. Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which decreases the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have great challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce the maximum demand for medical care by two thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Deletion may be preferred, but it should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if this happens first), as otherwise the transmission is quickly reactivated when measures are flexiblished.
Long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicines approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing of existing medicines.
Taking free selling medications for cold, drinking liquids and resting can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids and respiratory assistance may be required.
The use of steroids can make the results worse.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases for use in the treatment of COVID-19 are being investigated.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes the increased capacity and adaptation of medical care to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a key response measure to the outbreak.
ECDC and the WHO Regional Office for Europe have developed guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 tests, cancelling optional procedures where possible, separating and insulating positive patients in COVID-19 and increasing intensive care capacities through staff training and increasing the number of respirators and beds available.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called zero patient) could have originated.
The first case known for the new coronavirus can be dating back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, it has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a series of cases of pneumonia were observed for unknown cause of which Dr. Zhang Jixian was in charge at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "Sars-like coronavirus".
The police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was repudiated by his superiors for giving the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note and informed WHO.
At the beginning of January, sufficient cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, contributing to migration for the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transport centre and an important railway crossing.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Subsequent official data show that, as at 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms. As at 26 March, the United States had surpassed China and Italy with the largest number of confirmed cases in the world. As at 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people died and more than 364 000 recovered.
Around 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Because of the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as orders to stay at home, shelter orders at the place or confinement) and curfews. As at 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the population, meet some kind of confinement in the United States, more than 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa and 13 billion people are confined in India.
As at 26 March, 17 billion people around the world were carrying out some kind of confinement, which increased to 26 billion people two days later, about one third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case occurred on 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of cases of unknown-cause pneumonia, and her hospital reported to the Jianghan CDC in Wuhan on 27 December.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to SARS.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public note.
WHO was informed on the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned the doctors in Wuhan about "disseminating rumors" about the outbreak.
China's National Health Commission initially stated that there were no "clear evidence" of human transmission.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "popular war," to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in the history of humanity", on January 23, a health cord was announced that banned travel inside and outside Wuhan, this extended to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected a total of some 57 million people.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
The celebrations of the Chinese New Year (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed within 10 days.
Subsequently, another hospital, the Leishenshan Hospital, was built to receive more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 additional facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centres and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, which included the issuance of health statements for travellers and the extension of the spring holiday.
Universities and schools were also closed throughout the country.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions implemented a number of measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote labour measures were established in several regions of China.
Restrictions on travel within and outside Hubei were implemented.
Public transport was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that about 760 million people (over half of the population) faced some kind of restrictions on outdoor outlets. After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to prevent the "importation" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a 14-day mandatory quarantine for all international passengers entering the city. On 23 March, only one case had been transmitted at the national level in continental China in the previous five days, on this occasion, through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese Prime Minister, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of cases transmitted at the national level was basically blocked and that the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, were flexibilized two months after confinement had been imposed. On 26 March 2020, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that visa holders or residence permits would be suspended from 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will be completed.
Those who wish to enter China must apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese Government urged companies and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for signatures. The Council of State declared a day of mourning that it will begin with a time of national silence of three minutes on April 4 at 10:00, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, although the Central Government asked families to submit their online respects to comply with physical distance in order to avoid the rebroatment of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant increase in confirmed cases, mainly attributable to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Church of Jesus Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the Shincheonji devotees who visited Daegu from Wuhan were the origin of the outbreak.
As at 22 February, of the 9336 church followers, 1261 or approximately 13% reported symptoms.On 23 February 2020, South Korea declared the maximum alert level.
On 28 February, more than 2000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after the evidence confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The airline schedules were also affected and therefore modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and best-organized programme to test the virus in the population and isolate the infected people, in addition to identifying and quarantine those who were in contact with them.
The detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from other countries through a mobile application, drive-thru centers to perform virus detection tests with results available the next day and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20 000 people every day.
The South Korean programme is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantine in entire cities. South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered to be a malfunctioning management of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend their response.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases in a lower day in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as from 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad should remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on 1 April, South Korea received requests for assistance for virus testing from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that same day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sports events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran destined five trillion rials to fight the virus.
On February 26, 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantine.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between cities, although heavy traffic between cities as a result of the New Persa Nowruz year continued.
The Shian shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until March 16, 2020. During February, Iran became a center for spreading the virus after China.
Amid the allegations of a cover-up of the magnitude of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by 28 February, indicating that the magnitude of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament closed, and on 3 March 23 of its 290 members reported that they had positive results in the virus test.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
It indicated that there is a greater risk of spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths on the same day, the largest number recorded in the country since the outbreak.
As at 17 March, at least 12 Iranian politicians or politicians in exercise had died of the disease.
On March 23, Iran experienced 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to the coronavirus.
According to a WHO staff member, there may be five times more cases in Iran than are reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded the relief of economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists gave positive results in the SARS-CoV-2 tests in Rome.
The cases began to grow rapidly, leading the Italian Government to suspend all flights from and to China and to declare the state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of non-related COVID-19 cases were detected, starting with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
The Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, said, "You will not be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
On March 4, the Italian Government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities throughout the country as Italy reached 100 deaths.
All important sports events, including the A Series football matches, were to be held in closed doors until April, but, on March 9, all sports events were completely suspended for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte ordered the interruption of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Reanimation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations of medical ethics on the triage protocols that could be used.
On March 19, Italy overcame China as the country with the largest number of coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3405 deaths by the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As at 5 April, there were 128 948 confirmed cases, 15 887 deaths and 21 815 recoverys in Italy, and most of these cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy of a large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high rate of lethality.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British Government did not impose any type of social or mass quarantine distance measures on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism of the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to public concerns. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he discouraged social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from their homes whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure as soon as possible of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of £2500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distance measures, which banned meetings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those who were considered strictly necessary.
Unlike the previous measures, the police could require compliance with these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
Most companies were ordered to close, with the exception of those considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the principal public health institute of the U.S. Government, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start in testing, which hid the real magnitude of the outbreak at that time.
The conduct of evidence was impregnated by the defective test kits produced by the Federal Government in February, the lack of approval by the Federal Government of non-governmental test kits (from academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and the restrictive criteria for individuals to qualify for a test until early March (after a medical order was required).
As at 27 February, the Washington Post reported that less than 4000 tests had been conducted in the United States.
As at 13 March, The Atlantic reported that less than 14 000 tests had been conducted.

The general approval of the management of Trump's crisis has been polarized among the party lines.
Some U.S. officials and commentators criticized US dependence on importing critical materials, including special medical supplies, from China.
An analysis of travel patterns was used to identify and predict patterns of spread and was published in The Journal of Travel Medicine in mid-January 2020.

On the other hand, China ' s aid was widely accepted in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the epidemic.
WHO noted the difference between the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, when the Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided regular updates to avoid panic at the New Year's Days".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that, while "it was definitely not a recommendation made by WHO", it was "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the place where it is concentrated" and said that "it had no precedent in the history of public health." On 30 January, following the confirmation of the transmission of human beings outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak of an international public health emergency (ESPII), the sixth ESPII since the first time the measure was invoked during the 2009 swine influenza pandemic.
WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom, said ESPII was "due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without solid health systems".
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and movement".
On 5 February, WHO resorted to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparedness in low-income countries, and cited the urgency of supporting those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who contracted the virus, if any".
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are just as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future." On February 11, WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, had agreed to provide the "wide power of the United Nations system in the response".
As a result, a United Nations crisis management team was activated, which enabled the coordination of the response of all the United Nations, which, according to WHO, will allow them to "focus on health response while other agencies can provide their expertise to address the broader social, economic and development implications of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a WHO-China joint mission team was launched to provide international and WHO field experts in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and communicability of the disease" through the organization of workshops and meetings with major institutions at the national level and to conduct local visits to assess the "impact of provincial and county response activities, including urban and rural environments". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still too early to call the pandemic, countries should nevertheless be "in a preparatory phase".
In response to an outbreak in Iran, WHO sent there a joint mission team to assess the situation. On February 28, WHO officials said that the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "high", its highest level of warning and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO health emergency programme, warned in a statement that "This is a verification of reality for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared," insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that the current data did not guarantee that public health officials declared a global pandemic, and noted that this statement would mean that "we are basically accepting that all human beings on the planet will be exposed to that virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "very concerned, both about alarming levels of spread and severity, as well as about alarming levels of inaction." WHO has received significant criticism as a result of which the pandemic is considered to be inappropriate, including the late statement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The negative reaction included the request for the resignation of WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733 000 people as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of all persons during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group indicated that everyone has the right to life-saving interventions and that the Government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts stressed that all persons have the right to health, including persons with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older persons, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, those living in extreme poverty, persons detained, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the crisis by COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide full and timely information on political responses in countries around the world, in addition to views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the impact of confinement and travel restrictions, the digital centre includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese Government has been criticized by the United States, the Minister of the United Kingdom Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro, for his management of the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Several administrators at the provincial level of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC) were fired because of their management of quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political system to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, from public anger by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, rejected a prior recognition of the start of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, in favour of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
Donald Trump's U.S. administration has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and stated that China's "censorship oversuppressed a virus that has now become a global pandemic," which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics such as racism and "distraction" of his administration's failure to contain the disease.
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. Government describing a stratagema of communications with apparent origin on the National Security Council, and the strategy was cited as "All about China".
We have been told to try to transmit this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media of communication such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative Josep Borrell warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and generosity policy."
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, she is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also called for the United States to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while it reportedly sent aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, United States sanctions blocked Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba.
U.S. authorities were also accused of diverting aid to other countries to their own country.
And there have been reports of disputes related to masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "China alone responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cited an anonymous "high-level political source" stating that 80% of Russia's aid was "unusual or of little use for Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The president of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, rejected the journalistic reports and expressed their appreciation.
Russia also sent a cargo aircraft with medical assistance to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "when offering aid to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when American manufacturers of medical materials and equipment receive momentum, they will also be able to correspond if necessary."
The planned military exercise of NATO "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest exercise of NATO war since the end of the Cold War, will be carried out on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries participating, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was very affected by the virus, with about two dozen members of the infected parliament, in addition to fifteen other current and previous political figures.
On March 14, 2020, Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, wrote a public letter to world leaders to ask for help, and said that his country was having difficulties in combating the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted the demand that the United States adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave and higher levels of public health funds.
Political analysts anticipated that Donald Trump's re-election potential in the 2020 presidential election could be negatively affected. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts" after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will remain in quarantine for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized with regard to Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand the removal of Moon for what they considered to be a malfunctioning management of the outbreak by the Government, or to commend its response. The pandemic has allowed countries to adopt emergency legislation in response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, to govern by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament and the elections and to sanction those who are considered to have disseminated false information on the virus and the management of the crisis by the Government.
The outbreak of coronavirus was blamed for several cases of scarcity of supplies, as a result of the increased worldwide use of equipment to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistical and factory operations.
The United States Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and interruption of suppliers.
Several locations also witnessed panic-driven purchases that left the shelves empty of essential products, such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, causing scarcity of supplies.
The technological sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to the WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protection teams increased 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protection equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would endanger health workers.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of formula for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by acute food shortages.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation and illicit trade in essential products have been successful and avoided an acute shortage of food that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
North Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure adequate food for the population.
There are similar laws in Italy that require food producers to maintain reserves for these emergencies.
The damage to the world economy was felt in China: according to a journalistic report of 16 March, China's economy was severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to the government's measures to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
Since continental China is an important economic and manufacturing centre, the viral outbreak has been considered a significant threat of destabilization for the world economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has predicted that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture of the potential consequences emerges.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OPEC) was "revolved" after a sharp fall in oil prices due to China's lower demand.
On 24 February, world stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside continental China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock exchange rates, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, published their most pronounced falls since 2008, the Dow dropped 1191 points, the biggest fall in one day since the 2007–08 financial crisis.
The three indices ended the week with drops of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative perspective.
Actions fell again on the basis of the fears of the coronavirus, the biggest fall occurred on March 16.
Many consider that there is a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel bans, the closure of public places that include travel attractions and the recommendation of Governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, many airlines have cancelled flights due to the lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise companies sector reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important season of travel related to the Chinese New Year's holidays.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including New Year's festivals, while private companies also independently closed their tourist shops and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events and tourist attractions of the Lunar New Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Forbidden City of Beijing and the traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the New Year's Day until 10 February, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions account for 80 % of GDP and 90 % of the country's exports.
Hong Kong raised its level of response to the infectious disease to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations. The retail sector was affected globally, with reductions in care schedules or temporary closures.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America decreased by 40%.
North American and Middle East retailers experienced a drop of 50 to 60 %.
This also resulted in a fall from 33 to 43 % in pedestrian transit to the malls in March compared to February.
The operators of commercial centres around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of buyers and cancellation of events. According to an estimate of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in a situation of extreme poverty in Latin America than would have remained in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of the epidemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stuck in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate can reach 32%, according to estimates from the Bank of the Federal Reserve of San Luis. Confinement in India has left tens of millions of unemployed Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages). According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some type of unemployment. About 900 000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the confinement began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit plan. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have implemented short-term work schemes subsidised by the Government, known as Kurzarbeit, for their workers.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Britain.
Scenic arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which had an impact on the operations of the organizations and on people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Cultural and arts organizations tried to carry out their mission (often funded by public funds) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, maintain the security of its employees and the public and support artists whenever possible.
By March 2020, all over the world and in different degrees, museums, libraries, venues and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events and shows were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerated consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services. Important sporting events and other social events, such as music and concert festivals, technology conferences and fashion parades.
The film industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancellation of the celebrations of Holy Week in Rome, which take place during the last week of the season of Christian penance of Lent.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay in their homes instead of attending the Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, live broadcasting on the Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St.Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious agencies also cancelled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the outbreak and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and their residents to the sacred places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the global sport calendar since World War II.
Most important sports events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019–20, the Premier League 2019–20, the UEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA season and the 2019–20 NHL season.
The outbreak interrupted the plans of the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event will "reprogramm for a later date of 2020 but not after the summer of 2021." Casinos and other playgrounds around the world closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This led many betters to use the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many large theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work through the Internet as an alternative to the traditional live show, such as live concert broadcasts or the creation of "festives" on the Internet for artists to interpret, distribute or publish their work.
Online, numerous memes of the Internet were disseminated on the coronavirus, as many resort to humor and distraction in the midst of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and Asian descent, and to people in the areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
February reports (when most cases were still limited to China) have documented racist feelings in various groups around the world that expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair reprisal.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese feelings.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside it.
After the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe that experienced a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be the subject of suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea at first signed requests to achieve a ban on Chinese entry into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was a trend on Twitter.
In addition to other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, Chinese have reported higher levels of racist insults, as well as aggression.
U.S. President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Demonstrators in Ukraine attacked buses transporting Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from northeastern India, who share a border with China, and who study in the main Indian cities, suffered harassment in relation to the coronavirus outbreak.
The president of the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "that's why God avenged them."
China's consulate in Calcutta then condemned the comments and said they were "wrong." In China, they increased xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign rubbish" and intended for "waste".
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for parts or all of their coronavirus coverage.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to quickly share their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect the antibodies produced in response to the infection.
The presence of viruses in the samples is confirmed through the chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too mild symptoms to report them or who were asymptomatic.
Based on the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of the disease and the level of collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited evidence, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population until March 2020.
As at 23 March, no country had conducted tests to more than 3% of its population, and there are major variations in the number of tests performed in the various countries.
This variability is also likely to significantly affect the rate of lethality by reported cases, which are likely to be very overestimated in some countries.
Through the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), the test can be done in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasopharyngeal hisopates or sputum samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The chain reaction test of polymerase with reverse transcriptase performed with pharyngeal hisopates is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Subsequently, the virus may disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In people infected to whom the test is performed in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory tract by suction catheter, or the material that is expelled from the cough (sputo).
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) chain reaction of polymerase, and formed the basis for the 250 000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As at 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of clinical degree polymerase (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Find the gene "E" shared by all the betacoronaviruses and the specific RdRp gene of SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain the approval of emergency use by the Chinese National Administration of Medical Products of a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the chain reaction of polymerase. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are distributing their polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel with real-time reverse transcriptase for the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in the previous versions of the test kits resulted in unfinished results due to defective reagents, and a jam in conducting tests at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, less than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of the tests using two components was not determined until 28 February 2020, and only then were State and local laboratories allowed to start testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency authorisation. US commercial laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
As at 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of COVID-19 tests based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as at 9 March 2020, Quest Diagnostics made available tests for COVID-19 at the national level.
No limits were announced in quantity; specimen collection and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of CDCs.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the VECTOR State Research Centre for Virology and Biotechnology.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Medical Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be conducted within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received the FDA emergency-use authorisation for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test using the isotremic amplification technology of nucleic acids rather than the chain reaction of polymerase.
Since this does not require a series of alternate temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to carry out 50,000 tests per day. In Taiwan, a test is being developed using a monoclonal antibody that specifically links to the protein of the new coronavirus nucleocapside (N protein), with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes as well as a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "thorax X-rays have little diagnostic value in the early stages, while the results of the CT [computed tomography] can be obtained even before the symptoms appear."
Typical features in the TC include bilateral multilobe opacity in glazed glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical and later distribution.
As the disease progresses, sub-pleural domain develops, pawn pattern and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, at the point of origin of the current pandemic, in which the chain reaction of polymerase was compared with the computerized tomography, the computerized tomography is much more sensitive than the chain reaction of polymerase, although less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has recommended "not using computerized tomography as a method of detection or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19." Since March 2020, CDCs have recommended the chain reaction of polymerase as an initial test.
Part of the immune system's reaction to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people about 7 days after symptoms, to determine immunity and population surveillance. Analyses can be performed in central laboratories or by testing at the point of attention.
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For analysis in central laboratories, a single peripheral blood specimen is usually used, although serious specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For tests at the point of attention, a single specimen of blood is usually obtained by puncture in the skin.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is needed before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, the FDA appointed 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and can now distribute their antibody tests.
As at 7 April 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The ability to perform tests is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional chain reaction test of the viral RNA polymerase.
Antibodies, usually, can be detected 14 days after the infection began. In early April, the UK found that none of the antibodies test kits she bought were good enough to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which suspect patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a specimen tube," the patient spits in the tube, sends it and gets a result shortly. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyze suspicious cases in their homes, eliminating the risk that the patient will infect others if he goes to the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if one is used. In the drive-through centers for COVID-19 suspicious cases, a health professional takes the samples with the appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centers have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive tests in any country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Doctors said on March 2 that it had a capacity for approximately 12 000 tests per day in the outpatient environment and that 10 700 people had been tested the previous week.
Health insurance assumes costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a general capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
As at 19 March, evidence was offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown, as only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, at the calendar week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analysed in total, including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) had positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and the Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method for analyzing samples of 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples and only making more analysis if the combined sample is positive. On 5 February 2020, in Wuhan, the BGI opened an improvised emergency detection laboratory of 2000 square metres called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 中 , or "Fire Eye" in English), which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction, which was supervised by the founder of the BGI, Wang Jian, and which took 5 days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been 47 % higher and that the corresponding cost to face quarantine would have doubled without this capacity for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan laboratories were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As at 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50 000 tests per day. Multi-sixed open source designs were implemented provided by origami analysis that allow for the evaluation of up to 1122 samples of patients for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratories without the need for liquid manipulation robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected massive evidence in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve warming the samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On March 31, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection tests per person in its population than any other country, and was aimed at increasing the level of tests to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through capacity and the purchase of a mass production laboratory at Group 42 and BGI population level (based on its Huo-Yan emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory has the ability to perform tens of thousands of chain-reaction tests of polymerase with reverse transcriptase per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude that works outside China.
Different test formulas were developed that address different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control and Prevention Centres was not available until 28 January, which delayed the evidence available in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations of health experts on the evidence.
On the contrary, experts say that the high availability of South Korean tests helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea achieved its testing capacity, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supplies of hisopates and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented the conduct of private tests. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the wrong results could be due to the incorrect collection of the samples or the incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish Ministry said that it would remove the kits that threw incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, from the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits that Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "use them." The United Kingdom bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020, he announced that they were not serving.
The conduct of tests, complemented by the quarantine of those who obtained positive results and the identification of the people with whom they had contacted who gave positive results in SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the place where the first death by COVID-19 occurred in Italy, conducted two rounds of tests in the entire population of about 3400 inhabitants, with about ten days of difference.
Approximately half of the people who obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all the cases detected were quarantine.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this completely eliminated new infections.
With the intensive tracking of contacts, restrictions on travel abroad, testing and quarantine, the pandemic for coronavirus 2020 in Singapore advanced much slower than in other developed countries, but that did not apply extreme restrictions, such as forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend residents to stay in their homes, but schools were reopened in time after the holiday of March 23.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive tracking of contacts, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent confinements, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have carried out more tests, in relation to the number of deaths, have much lower rates of lethality for cases, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who have only mild symptoms or have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to perform tests and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column "Positive as % of evidence" is influenced by the policy for conducting the country's tests.
A country that performs tests only in people entering hospitals will have a higher number of positive tests as % than a country that performs tests in all citizens, whether they manifest symptoms or not, the other issues are the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands in order to eliminate dirt, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
Hand washing with soap on a constant basis in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted through the fecal-oral route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common cold, for example, if their hands are not washed before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical moments during the day when it is important to wash your hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after cleaning a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
If no water or soap is available, hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after preparing the meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After the nose swollen, coughing or sneezing.
After playing animals, animal food or animal waste.
Hand medical hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before taking medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove from the hands pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause a disease) and chemical substances that can cause damage or disease.
This is especially important for people who manipulate food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the rate of child mortality in childbirth at home.
A study conducted in 2013 showed that improvements in hand-washing practices can lead to small improvements in the height growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates related to respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases can be reduced by simple behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate for these diseases by almost 50%.
Hand-washing interventions can reduce diarrhoea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing drinking water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be related to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way of preventing acute diarrhea and respiratory infections, such as automatic behavior adopted in households, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children under five years of age, and lives of an estimated 1.8 million children per year are collected.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia together represent almost 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, converting hand washing with soap before eating and after using the bathroom into a rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths by diarrhoea to almost half and deaths by acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene programmes (WASH).
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small harmful effect of hand washing is that its frequent realization can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
According to a Danish study conducted in 2012, excessive handwashing can cause a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin squamous known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in health workers.
Too frequent handwashing is also considered one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using the bath (orange, defecar), after cleaning a child's tail (change diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish or poultry meat.
Other occasions where a proper hand washing technique to prevent the transmission of diseases should be practiced include before and after treatment of a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or ringing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low hand washing rate with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that on average 38.7% of families practiced hand washing with soap. A study conducted in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 per cent; the United States was about half with 77 per cent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviour, to increase the adoption of the habit of washing hands with soap at critical times. Group washing of hands of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate hand washing into children's behaviour.
The "Essential Health Care Programme" implemented by the Department of Education of the Philippines is an example of a tailored action to promote children ' s health and education.
To disperse twice a year, in addition to washing hands with soap every day, brushing teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Eliminating microorganisms from the skin improves by adding soaps or detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective to clean the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in the water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that analysed the transfer of contaminated solid soap bacteria concluded that the transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
However, CDCs claim that "liquid soap with dispensing controls is preferable that does not imply the use of hands".
Antibacterial soaps have been strongly promoted for a health-conscious audience.
Currently, there is no evidence that the use of recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves organisms resistant to antibiotics by nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as trillosan, which has an extensive list of strains of resistant organisms.
In this way, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as they are promoted.
In addition to the surfactant that protects the skin, sophisticated formulas can contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity and more skin conditioning (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, vegetable extracts).A thorough analysis of the Public Health School at the University of Oregon indicated that common soaps are as effective as antibacterial soaps for the consumer who contain triclosan to prevent diseases and eliminate bacteria from the hands.
Nice hot water to wash your hands is not enough to remove bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soap water is more effective than cold soap water to eliminate natural oils that retain land and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that the use of warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load in the hands.
A hand or antiseptic disinfectant for hands is a waterless agent for the hygiene of hands.
At the end of 1990 and in the first part of the twenty-first century, hand-free hygiene agents and with rubbish alcohol (also known as a hand-based solution for rubbish, hand-free antiseptic solution for rubbish or hand disinfectants) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in a gel, or a moisturizing agent as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases antimicrobial activity. Hand disinfectants containing 60 to 95% of alcohol at least effectively eliminate germs.
Alcohol-based disinfectants to rub remove bacteria, bacteria resistant to various medicines (SARM and ERV), from tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based disinfectants containing 70 % alcohol eliminate 99.97 % (reduction from 3.5 logarithms, similar to the reduction of 35 decibels) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99 % to 99.999 % (reduction from 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand disinfectants are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based disinfectants are practically ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Sufficient solution for antiseptic or alcohol-based hands should be used to rub, such as wetting or completely covering both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel are dried.
The finger tips should also be washed well, rubbing them on both palms. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend handwashing before handwashing disinfectants for rubbing, especially when the hands are visiblely dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and on the rapid elimination activity of micro-organisms; however, they should not be used as a replacement for proper hand washing unless no water or soap is available.
The frequent use of alcohol-based disinfectants may dry the skin, unless the skin is added to the formula with emollients or hydrants.
The dryness effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based disinfectants containing emollients caused irritation and dry skin significantly lower than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or alcohol hypersensitivity or additives present in hand-based solutions for rubbishing are very rare.
The slightest tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis was attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite its effectiveness, agents without water do not remove organic matter from their hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand disinfectants are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain in their hands.
The effectiveness of hand-free disinfectants depends largely on the ingredients and the formula, in addition, historically, has been much less than that of alcohol and alcohol-based solutions to rub.
More recently, it has been found that formulas using benzalconium chloride have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse reactions of the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot buy soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ashes or land can be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that, if land or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of diseases rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, as, in contact with water, it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommended using ashes or sand as an alternative to soap when no soap is available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wet your hands with warm or cold current water.
Current water is recommended because containers with stagnated water may be contaminated, while the water temperature apparently makes no difference.
Frotate your hands to form foam with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your fingernails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people usually wash their hands more thoroughly when they use soap than when they use water alone.
Restrict for at least 20 seconds.
Restraining creates friction, which helps eliminate skin germs, and restricting for longer periods eliminates more germs.
Rinse well with current water.
Rinse in a container can contaminate your hands again.
Dry with a clean towel or let dry in the air.
Wet and wet hands are contaminated more easily. The parts that are most often forgotten are the thumb, the wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails
Artificial nails and glazed nails can accommodate micro-organisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to prevent the hands from drying; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several economic options can be used to facilitate hand washing when no current water or soap is available, for example, pouring water from a hanged bin or pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ashes if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to save water, such as "home taps" and other economic options.
A homemade tap is a simple technology that consists in using a suspended jar of a rope and a lever powered with the foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bar soap.
Effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more are researches that indicate that paper towels are much more hygienic than electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the association of the European Tissue Symposium paper towel industry, to compare the hygiene levels offered by paper towels, hot-air dryers and modern air jet dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, it was detected that the total number of bacteria increased, on average, by 194 % in the fingertips and by 254 % in the palms.
Drying with the air jet dryer resulted in an average increase in the total number of bacteria of 42 % in the finger yolks and 15 % in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% in the fingertips and 77% in the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bath users and the bathing environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds, it is alleged, of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to blow the microorganisms of the hands and unit and potentially contaminate other users of the bathroom and the bathroom environment at a distance of up to 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different methods of drying of hands were evaluated.
The following changes in the number of bacteria after drying of hands were observed:
There are many manufacturers of different hand dryers, and the hand dryers have been compared to the drying with paper towels.
Washing your hands with hand disinfecting wipes is an alternative during trips, when there is no water or soap.
The alcohol-based disinfectant must contain at least 60 % alcohol.
The hand-washing of doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide comments to remind hospital staff members that wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with their use.
The handwashing of the doctors is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to form foam and reduce all parts of the hands.
Hands should be tightened together by intertwining their fingers.
If there are remains under the nails, you can use a pig brush to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water in their hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This prevents the hands from being contaminated again by those surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care environment is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("genes") and avoid transmitting them.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, lack of hand washing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical environments, where many doctors and nurses usually forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that correct hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%. The World Health Organization has published a sheet showing hand washing and standard hand rubbing in the health care sectors.
The preliminary version of the organization's hand hygiene guide can also be found on its website so that the public can comment.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Commercial devices can measure and verify the hygiene of the hands, if it is necessary to demonstrate compliance with the rules.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
prior to aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals in soap (medicine soaps or "antibacterials") gives the handwashing agent the possibility of disposal.
This removal may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic resistant organisms are very common. To wash your hands before surgery, you need to have a tap that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, a little chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry your hands after washing, a sterilized brush to wash and another sterilized instrument to clean yourself under your nails.
All the jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms to the elbow, in general, for 2 to 6 minutes.
It is not necessary to wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, the water of the forearms should be prevented from returning to hands.
After washing, the hands dry with a sterilized cloth and a surgical robe is placed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for hands before and after treating sick people.
In order to control staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand cleaning is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when the frequency of hand hygiene increases by more than 35%.
Washing with common soap results in more than triple incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. When comparing hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced by 26% more bacteria contamination than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing the flu virus A H1N1 and Clostridium spores difficult from the hands than alcohol-based disinfectants. Interventions to improve the hygiene of the hands in health care centers may include training the personnel on hand washing, increasing the availability of alcohol-based disinfectant and written and oral reminders to the staff.
More research is needed on which of these interventions are the most effective in the different health-care environments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an economic and fundamental tool for achieving good health and even good food.
However, the lack of reliable supply of water, soap or facilities to wash hands in households, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal hands-washing behaviour.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few cracks to wash hands near public or private toilets, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates can also be the result of rooted habits rather than lack of soap or water.
The promotion of hand washing with soap can influence political decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of hand washing and lead to a long-term change in behaviour in the population.
For this to work effectively, follow-up and evaluation is necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was noted that community approaches are effective in increasing hand-washing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective; an example of promoting hand-washing in schools is UNICEF 'Three Stars ' approach, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among others hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to, finally, three stars.
The construction of hand-washing stations can be part of the campaigns to promote hand-washing to reduce diseases and infant mortality.
The World Hand Wash Day is another example of awareness campaign that seeks to bring about a change in behaviour. As a result of the pandemic of coronavirus 2019-2020, UNICEF prompted the creation of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies have considered the overall profitability of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting soap hand washing is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was recognized for the first time in the middle of the 20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant smells called myasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food-borne diseases and health-care-related infections led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States to promote more active hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The swine flu outbreak in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 made it more aware in many countries of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, posters were hung with "correct techniques to wash their hands" along with the sinks of public bathrooms and the bathrooms of office and airport buildings.
The phrase "washing your hands" is a statement that you don't want to take care of something or share the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the Bible passage of Matthew in which Poncio Pilate washed his hands before the decision to crucifi Jesus Christ, but it has become a much wider phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, which represents her awareness of guilt over the crimes she had committed and had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on non-ethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value the elements for hand washing more.
In addition, those people who are allowed to wash their hands after such reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Simbolic hand washing, with water, but without soap, is part of the ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Bahaism, Hinduism, Tevilá and Netilat Yadayim in Judaism, the washing in Christianity and the wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend the washing of hygienic hands, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam force themselves to wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam force themselves to wash their hands before and after each meal.
Risk control in the workplace before COVID-19
Risk controls in the workplace before COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational hygiene and safety methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Adequate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and work and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of workers who may be likely to contract COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal work contact with the public and coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Works with a risk of medium exposure include those in which frequent or close contact is required with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who may be infected by the current Community transmission or by an international trip.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail sales environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and individual protective equipment available in case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health care workers and funeral services, exposed to people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19, have a high risk of exposure, which increases to very high if they carry out procedures that can generate aerosols in people who are known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples of these people.
Risk controls appropriate to these workers include engineering controls, such as negatively pressured ventilation rooms, and individual protection equipment suitable for work.
COVID-19 outbreaks may have several consequences in the workplace.
Workers may lack work because they get sick, because they have to take care of others or because of fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which goods are demanded and the means of acquiring such goods (such as buying in hours other than peaks, by means of home shipping services or by window from the car).
Finally, shipments of articles from geographical areas severely affected by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A preparedness and response plan for infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments, and risk factors for individual workers, such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address these risks and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
Targets of response to an outbreak include reducing transmission among staff members, protecting people at the highest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used framework for occupational hygiene and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative and, finally, individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolation of employees from work-related hazards without recourse to workers' behaviour and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in labour policies or procedures requiring action by the worker or employer.
Individual protection teams are considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of individual protection equipment should be selected depending on the danger to the worker, placed as appropriate (e.g. breathing equipment), used in a proper and systematic manner, frequently reviewed, maintained, replaced if necessary and removed, cleaned and stored or discarded correctly to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), jobs with lower exposure risk have minimal work contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, recommendation to workers to stay at home if they are ill, respiratory hygiene standards that include covering themselves by coughing and sneezing, provision of paper handkerchiefs and containers for waste, preparation for teleworking or step-by-step shifts if necessary, deter workers from using tools and equipment from others, and maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Immediate identification and isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory disease stay in their homes until they stop having fever, signs of fever and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medications to relieve symptoms or reduce fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these policies.
According to OSHA, work with a medium exposure risk includes those that require frequent or close contact of less than six feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known or suspected of having COVID-19, but who could have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to the community transmission of the moment around the company's location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as schools, working environments with a high concentration of people and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic protective covers and the placing of a window for the service so that the customer can request from the car. Administrative controls for this group and higher risk groups include recommending sick workers to stay at home, replacing presenceal meetings with virtual communications, setting up scalded shifts, suspending trips that are not essential to existing COVID-19 outbreaks sites, developing emergency communication plans, including a forum to respond to workers' concerns, providing up-to-date training and training on risk factors and prevention behaviours in relation to the COVID-19, training of workers with a low-efficiency workforce, training of workers with a low-efficiency workforce, training of workers with a low-efficiency toolkit and training equipment.
Workers in this risk group rarely should use respirators.
If a person is sick on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from the others at a distance of 6 feet, appointing a crew member to treat the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person or asking him to cover his mouth and nose with paper scarfs when coughing or sneezing.
The cabin crew should use disposable surgical gloves to treat a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and, perhaps, individual protective equipment if the sick passenger has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other discardable items should be disposed of in a bag for hazardous biological waste and contaminated surfaces should be subsequently cleaned and disinfected. In the case of commercial navigation, such as cruises and other ships carrying passengers, risk controls include delaying the journey by disease, insulation and immediately informing the medical centre on board if someone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
The ideal thing is for medical control to be done in the isolated person's cabin. In the case of schools and childcare centres, CDCs recommend short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling excursions, assemblies and other mass meetings, such as physical or choir education classes or meals in the dining room, increasing the space between pupils, scaling in and out of time, limiting non-essential visits and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distance strategies, it may be considered to extend the cancellation of classes. For police personnel carrying out routine daily activities, CDCs consider that the immediate risk to health is low.
Police officers are recommended to contact persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during a detention, workers must clean and disinfect their working belt and equipment with a household cleaning spray or towels before reuse and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers that certain health workers and morgues are within categories of high or very high exposure risk.
Among the high-risk exposure work, are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19.
These are converted into works of very high exposure risk if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19 or if they take or handle samples of these patients.
Some aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopies, some dental procedures and tests or invasive sampling.
High-risk exposure morgue work includes those in which workers are involved in the preparation of the bodies of people who had COVID-19 or who were suspected to have it at the time of death; they become very high exposure risk if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include insulation rooms for patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspicions of COVID-19, even when they are performed with aerosol generation procedures.
Specialised ventilation with negative pressure can be suitable in some medical care environments and morgues.
Samples should be handled by taking Biosecurity Level precautions 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering different waiting rooms be separated depending on whether or not they are suspected of having COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for people working at a distance of up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of having been infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those who carry out aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators with filter mask approved by NIOSH or higher should be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes adjustment tests, trainings and medical examinations.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted by body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for the classification staff of patients entering.
For those who take respiratory samples from patients with COVID-19, give them attention or transport them without performing aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical masks, glasses or facial protective, robe and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Because the provision of personal protection equipment is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the entry permit of a patient with COVID-19 to those involved in their direct care only, using the same mask without withdrawing it while paying attention to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal protection equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic people.

CASE: [Covid-19] Relieving the burden and preparing for the future
DATE/DATE OF AMENDMENT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, universally coordinated time
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
This month, we are in unique circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 demonstrates our human interconnection at the global level and the responsibilities we have with each other.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community construction that form the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues in email messages, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we are lucky to work with are.
I couldn't feel any greater gratitude and pride for all of you being my companions.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation I felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to come to Wikipedia at this time and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to all.
Your work makes this possible, either by keeping sites running, helping our colleagues to receive their payment or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a time when not only do we do but the way we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and its role in this, starting next week, we will make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to talk about our approach and our schedule for the next days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be an appropriate response to what we are facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
To a greater extent, we wanted to eliminate stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and contracted workers:
our daily work expectancy will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until next notice.
We are not declaring a holiday; if you can work on a more normal schedule, this would be of great use to the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to take care of your loved ones, make purchases or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not taking the count of your hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although it shouldn't be necessary to say it, we say it.
There is no need to request sick leave or paid free time; just inform your manager and help your team to review schedules and schedules to ensure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis of COVID-19, notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so that T&C can help with the support and make sure the management is aware of their situation).
People who work per hour will receive the full payment.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff colleagues who work per hour.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours in normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and cannot work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's your personal care.
What we ask you is that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and we can adapt properly.
Certain work is considered essential.
There are some things we must continue to do.
Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resources Operations, Confidence and Security and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that might require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to assess the current goals and modify our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are sufficient tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan "doubling the hours to catch up" when the pandemic is over.
It will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and we will work to establish new targets and deadlines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan to allocate more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care for loved ones while adapting to the needs of those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and communicate the next steps to delegates and teams as soon as we have a confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Status, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week we found out that one of our colleagues from San Francisco's office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces of the San Francisco office.
They used an antiviral solution for hospital use to disinfect all surfaces, in addition to the reception and elevators that go to our apartment.
The building has adopted its own duty protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to come back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its protocol for COVID-19 with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
Since last week, our DC office has moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the patterns shared with San Francisco.
As some of our New York City colleagues already know, we have also talked about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues work remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have already worked remotely since before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
It limits the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to split them over several days.
Clearly define the meeting with a list of topics and send the reading materials in advance.
Adopt the use of the video by default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Design a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone who helps take notes (or take notes in a collaborative way).
Send an email to technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use the welfare refund for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The RR Operations team HH. is analysing the guidelines on ergonomics based on web seminars to support increased work distributed throughout the Foundation.
This last week we ask all beneficiaries of Community grants to cancel the public events financed by Wikimedia, such as publishers, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could impede the fulfilment of its share of the activities agreed for the subsidy and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
This next week we will follow up with additional guidelines in Wikimania and other community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at the global level seems to be, in part, sadness for interruption and, in part, relief for clarity and the ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
From now on, CRT will be working to set up a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintaining contact in relation to COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 p.m., coordinated universal time/07:00 p.m., Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We will take this opportunity to share additional developments, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help in the way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email message and all additional essential information related to COVID-19 in Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are being greatly affected at present.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, some coverage problem or anything you might need help with, don't hesitate to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If you have confidential or sensitive issues, send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of International Global Operations, RR. HH.
None of these changes should be considered a abandonment of our work and obligations.
Instead, they are acknowledging that, at the moment, our work and obligations should probably be adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures we believe necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service in which it trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and take place for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible and, therefore, we need you to take care of and take care of your families so that they can find themselves in the best possible state when the need arises.
Now, please, wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that adheres to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of angiotensin converter enzyme (ACE) related by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), which makes it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also serves as an entry point to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The converting enzyme of angiotensin 2 is a metaloenzyme containing zinc and is found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domain of peptidase M2 and a C-terminal domain of renal carrier of colectrin amino acids.
ECA2 is a type I unipass membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the surface of the lung cells and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of the ECA2 is swirled from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedasa and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted by the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is mainly attached to the cell membrane of the lungs type II alveolar cells, to the small intestine enterocytes, to the venous arterial and endothelial cells and to the smooth muscle blood cells of most organs.
The MARN expression of the ECA2 is also found in the brain crust, stride body, hypothalamus and encephalic trunk.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract ECA.
ACE breaks the hormone of angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictive.
In turn, the ECA2 sprinkles the amino acid carboxyl-terminal phenylalanine of angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also spread several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, appeline, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greline.
ECA2 also regulates the traffic of membranes of the SLC6A19-neutral amino acid transporter and has been associated with Hartnup's disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus causing SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus causing COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 spike protein S1 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and the transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to the endosomes inside the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's serine protease TMPRSS2, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as possible therapy. This has led to certain assumptions that lowering ACE2 levels in cells could help to combat infection.
However, various professional associations and regulators have recommended continuing ACE and standard BRA inhibitor therapy.
A systematic metaanalysis review published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction of 34 % of pneumonia risk compared to control cases".
In addition, "the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients who received treatment with ACE inhibitors and who had a higher risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not so solid for the overall risk of pneumonia."
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with acute respiratory difficulty syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharides.
The mean life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of the effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classical renin-angiotensin inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases where circulating angiotensin II is elevated. RhECA2 infusion was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, that is, the process of identifying people ("contacts") who might have been in contact with a infected person.
Several applications were developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracking applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of the users of the application.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to record the proximity of one user to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support Bluetooth-based applications directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, has implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source application and will be handed over to the government. In North Macedonia, "StopKorona!" was launched, a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The implementation was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at April 14, 2020, the application was awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On April 12, the government reported that the contact tracking application was at an advanced stage of development and that it would be available for implementation in the coming weeks. It is planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application and the BlueTrace protocol of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimeter application for patients living in Moscow and having received a diagnosis of COVID-19, designed to ensure that they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Security Engineering at Cambridge University, exposed several potential practical problems with applications-based systems, including false positives and possible lack of effectiveness if the adoption of the application is limited to only a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications in its App Store to "officiary" or trustworthy organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus applications and, in particular, about whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations submitted a communiqué calling for limits to this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportional";
extensions of monitoring and monitoring would have to have extinction clauses;
the use of data should be limited to objectives related to COVID-19;
security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of such protection;
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protections against abuse should be implemented and citizens' rights should be established to respond to such abuse;
Significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and marginalized groups, will be mandatory. Germany's Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent monitoring by withdrawing the tracking mechanism of its operating systems when no longer required.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of applications, eliminating both the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw data from locations present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary for all systems with central servers to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created using central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on an application to carry out contact tracking.
Rather than using a specific application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined it to generate notices through text messages for potentially contagious people.
In addition to using this information to alert about possible contacts, the government has also made the location information available to the public, which is permitted due to far-reaching changes to the privacy laws of the information after the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, considered using centralized and privacy protection systems.
As at 6 April 2020, the details have not yet been published.
Tracking contacts with privacy protection is a well-established concept, with a large number of published researches dating back to at least 2013. As at 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as the use of low-energy Bluetooth (BLE) to record the proximity of one user to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort that contains both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking to preserve privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, previously known as contact event numbers, CEN) and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracking for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data never comes out of the device and all the matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for the use of techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location or intersection data from routes to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Applications out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during an epidemic", published in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of those data.
On 5 April 2020, a number of groups united around what was essentially the same approach and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global NPT Coalition with the objective of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interoperability of tracking and alert applications, a key aspect for broad adoption.
On April 9, 2020, the Singaporean government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government application.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, companies that control iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for the tracking of contacts that, as they assured, would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Bluetooth technology and privacy protection cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
implementation of tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking applications that protect privacy
integrating this functionality directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the issues of persistent adoption and monitoring by distributing, first of all, the system through updates of the operating system and then withdrawing them in the same way once the threat has passed.
b'Reperfilation (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the one for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with scientific research that currently seeks to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research lines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and plasma transfusion of convalescent. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple sites of binding with the ligament.
The analysis of these compound sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are potassium-like protein, RNA-led polymerase, helicase, protein S and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest which then optimized and analyzed to identify the similarity of their main chain to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a powerful drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquin is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York State tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an emergency use authorisation (EUA).
Treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised according to an AU only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized, but who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
CDCs said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
The doctors have said they use the drug when "there's no other choice."
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
The Langone Medicine Faculty of the NYU is conducting a study on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen were negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan in 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half was given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing tests supporting the drug are scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would use the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration on the purchase of the drug. The drug can be less effective in serious cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant or conceiving women.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefits were observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by joining the protein.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that joins the SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, criticism has emerged about the allocation of resources to the rehabilitation of specifically developed drugs for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against multiple philoid viruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in a more severe disease and transmission.
Some initial studies prior to the trials suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are ongoing, including two directed by hospitals at the University of Cleveland; one for people with a moderate disease and the other for those with a more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C are underway for people hospitalized and severely affected by COVID-19; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one without control (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin antibiotic on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclesonide), an inhalable asthma corticosteroid, such as treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway and 200 severe patients hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be registered to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicin in reducing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is inscribing 6000 adults aged 40 and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Pregnant women, who breast-feeding or who do not have a affective contraception method are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On April 14, a multicentre study was announced in Italy with 300 patients investigating the use of sodium enoxaparin at preventive and therapeutic doses.
As SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the re-approach of antiviral drugs developed for previous outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
These are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocking the IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

b'A vaccine against COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, in less than 18 months.
In April, five possible vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the requirements of the IECO initiative for the development of a vaccine are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being investigated and developed in early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the goals of the main platforms that went to phase I security studies are the following:
nucleic acid (ADN and RNA) (phase I developer and possible vaccine: Modern, mRNA-1273)
virus vector (phase I developer and possible vaccine: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (is presumed to be planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity tests, usually random, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several sites, while determining more precise and effective doses.
Phase III trials usually involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease, while controlling the adverse effects that occur at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (they were still in "preclinical" research).
Around January 24, 2020 in Australia, Queensland University announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecularly subject vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune reaction.
About January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and hopes that human tests will begin in 2021.
Vaccination development projects were announced at the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in China on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
About January 29, 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had begun to develop a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotechnology partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing association with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a document with a design for a vaccine with similar technology to that used in treatment with neo-antigenic cancer vaccines.
On 25 March, the head of the research institute announced that the vaccine synthesis had been completed and that the tests were beginning.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within the 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, the University of Washington in San Luis announced its projects to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at the Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research at Silver Spring, both in West Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Near March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that it was working with 11 isolated people and that, while it progresses rapidly, it would take at least one and a half years to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in the city of Quebec, Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to coronavirus with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The possible vaccine is at the laboratory research stage and human tests are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Previously that week, The Guardian reported that the U.S. president Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'great amounts of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine", to which the German government complained.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a RNA-based vaccine.
The potential vaccine based on RNAm BNT162 is currently in preclinical tests and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible final vaccine could begin in autumn.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparation (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a research alliance of a vaccine against COVID-19 that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which carries the total investment of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists began testing in animals of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at the London Imperial College announced on March 20, 2020 that they were developing a self-replication ARN vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, including a large number of potential vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
More or less at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced the tests of PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19, in mice and said that "the vaccines of the SARS-CoV-2 subunit, administered by MNA, obtained powerful responses from antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination."
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal sprayer.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designated to replicate within human bacteria and produce particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, the industrial sector and three U.S. universities gathered resources to access IBM supercomputers, along with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing resources.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized essay in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
Vaccines that are developing may not be safe or effective.
Initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, demonstrate the need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures for the handling of living viruses and with international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
SRAG and SROM vaccines have been tested in non-human animal models.
By 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SRAG that has proven to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat SRAG was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. Nor is there a confirmed vaccine against SROM.
When SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, a vaccine against SROM (based on DNA) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were underway, all of which are virus vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChadOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory according to which the virus causing COVID-19 was known and there was already a vaccine.
The patents cited by various social media publications refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other coronavirus strains, such as SRAG coronavirus.
b'The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and the beginning of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organic insufficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases were reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568 000 people have recovered. The virus spreads mainly among people during close contact, usually through droplets that occur when coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these drops occur when they are exhaled, they usually fall to the floor or on the surfaces, instead of being contagious at long distances.
People can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the beginning of the symptoms, although the spread is also possible before symptoms and in late stages of the disease appear. The standard method for diagnosis is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal hisopate.
It is recommended to use masks for those suspected of having the virus and its caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary. Some authorities recommend that they be not used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment against COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in the six regions of WHO.
Those who are infected by the virus may be asymptomatic or have similar symptoms to those of the flu, such as fever, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent chest pressure, confusion, difficulty walking and blue face or lips. If these symptoms occur, immediate medical attention is recommended.
It is less common to observe symptoms in upper respiratory tracts, such as sneezing, nasal drip and throat pain.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China initially experienced chest oppression and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organic insufficiency and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. According to reports, not all infected people have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not have symptoms is unknown at the moment and is being studied. Korean Disease Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in daily cases on 1 April. Of the 166 infections of that day, 130 (78 %) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can have great viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than when talking with a normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering your mouth by coughing can cause droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that the transmission through biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside the people's bedrooms gave positive ARN viral.
Some medical procedures such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (PCR) can lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore air transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of spreading through the faeces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is more contagious when people have symptoms; although the spread is possible before the beginning of the symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for the Prevention and Control of Diseases (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear how easy it is to spread, one person usually infects two or three more people. The virus survives hours or days on the surface.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours in products with 99 % copper.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipidal layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken in an average of two days after the initiation of hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest viral load was observed on the second day of the test.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a group of cases of acute respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related nature coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, domestic soap kills the virus, as it resuscitates its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells by converting angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) enzyme, which abounds more in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "particle" (peplomer) to connect with ECA2 and enter the host cell.
In 12% of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, an acute heart injury was identified, which is most common in severe disease.
Cardiovascular symptoms rates are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease evolution, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors have a high expression in the heart and participate in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31 %) and venous thromboembolism (25 %) was detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a poor prognosis. In the autopsies of people who died from COVID-19, diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates with lymphocytes in the lungs were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epithelial cells expressing ECA2 in respiratory tracts, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was observed that GM-CSF secretariat T lymphocytes correlate with the recruitment of IL-6 secretariat monocytes and a severe pulmonary pathology in patients with COVID-19.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the chain reaction of polymerase with real-time reverse transcript (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually done in samples of the respiratory tracts obtained by a nasopharyngeal hisopate; however, samples of nasal hisopates or sputums may also be used.
Usually, the results are available between a few hours or two days.
Blood tests may also be used, but two samples of blood should be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that the world's laboratories could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect the virus infection.
As at 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
The experience in China with the tests has shown that the accuracy is only from 60 to 70 %.
The FDA in the United States approved the first immediate diagnostic test on March 21, 2020 to use it at the end of that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular opacity glass with peripheral, asymmetrical and later distribution are common in the initial stages of the infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain may appear, pattern in disorderly pavement (septal lobulillar thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation.
Few data on microscopic lesions and the physiopathy of COVID-19 are available.
The main pathological results of autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pneumocite hyperplasia, atypically large pneumocite, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of giant cells with multiple nucleus
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxemia.
pneumonia in healing: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Blood: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, washing hands with water and soap frequently for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
CDCs recommend covering their mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, in case they do not have handkerchiefs, using the inside of the elbow.
Appropriate hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
CDCs have recommended the use of fabric caps in public places, one of the reasons is to limit the transmission by asymptomatic people. Social distance strategies seek to reduce the contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling public mass meetings.
Distance patterns also indicate that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As a vaccine is not expected until 2021, as soon as possible, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic peak, which is known as "planning the curve".
CDCs also recommend washing hands frequently with water and soap for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visiblely dirty, before eating and after the nose, coughing or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of an alcohol-based disinfectant with a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and soap available in time. For areas where hand disinfectants are not easy to obtain, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for antisepsia of the hands".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are provided with supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other affected vital organs.
CDCs recommend that those suspected of having the virus use a simple mask.
Extracorporal membrane (OMEC) oxygenation has been used to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, healthy personal hygiene and lifestyle and food have been recommended.
Support treatments can be useful for those who have mild symptoms at the initial stage of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have issued recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensivists and pneumologists in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of several agencies in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paretamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health-care environments when procedures that can generate aerosols such as intubation or manual ventilation are performed.
CDCs recommend that health care professionals take care of people with COVID-19 place the patient in an air infection isolation area (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to prevent air transmission. CDCs highlight the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PEP) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is EPP coat, mask, protective glasses and medical gloves. When available, the respirators (instead of the masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use by means of an emergency use authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not specified in the product's indications is not guaranteed.
When no masks are available, CDCs recommend the use of protective cases or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support is being actively studied for people hospitalized with respiratory impairment related to COVIDA-19 and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the respiratory tracts.
It is not yet known whether either of these two provides the same benefit to people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to high-flow nasal cannula. Serious cases occur mainly in older adults (over 60 years of age and in particular those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have enough beds per head in hospitals, limiting the ability of the health system to handle the sudden increase in serious cases of COVID-19 requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 % was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 % needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4 % died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 has acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is becoming more and more difficult.
Breathers that have different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize the supply of oxygen, while minimizing the risk of pulmonary injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new medicines may delay until 2021, several medicines that are being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced testing.
Antiviral medicines can be tested in people with severe disease.
WHO recommends volunteers to participate in tests on the efficacy and safety of possible treatments. FDA granted a temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not been subjected to the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "close contact" and therefore a potential risk of infection through surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a possible risk is detected, the application not only recommends self-confinement, but also alerts local health officers. Analysing the macrodata of cellular information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected people and those with whom they were in contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen quarantine and protect those who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the summary data on the location of the phones with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine breaches.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said mobile phone operators have informed him that "anyways 40% of people are still moving."
The German Government carried out a 48-hour weekend hacket with more than 42 000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel anxious about quarantine, travel restrictions and the side effects of treatment or fear infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor: "The growing social isolation, loneliness, anxiety for health, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being."
The disease may follow a mild evolution with few or no symptoms, so it will look like other diseases of the upper respiratory tracts, such as common cold.
Mild cases are usually recovered within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to do so.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection by the COVID-19 virus, according to data from other similar viruses, such as the SRAG virus and SROM, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more serious cases, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to water respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organic failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorder and heart, kidney and liver damage.
The alteration of coagulation, specifically the increase in protombin time, has been reported in 6% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19; whereas the alteration of renal function is observed in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20% to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average period of seven days was spent between hospitalization and death.
In an incipient case study, the mean time from the manifestation of the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a complete interval from 6 to 41 days.
In a study by the Chinese National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples of the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes in pneumocates were observed.
The image of the lungs resembled acute respiratory difficulty syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8 percent of the deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to US March data, 89% of hospitalized people had a pre-existing condition. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of conditional mortality vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The insufficient number of mild cases can make the mortality rate overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or to die compared to non-smokers. They are concerned about the long-term consequences of this disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a decrease of 20 to 30% of the pulmonary capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and the images of the lungs suggest organ affection.
This can also cause post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
As at March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated long-term effective immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity seems to be possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but recovered cases of COVID-19 have been reported that subsequently gave positive coronaviruses.
These cases are believed to be a worsening of persistent infection and not a re-infection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The real origin is not known, but, by December 2019, the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, noted as the first date of the start of symptoms as of December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, in addition to being affected by the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, treatment options, the time spent since the initial outbreak and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
By the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CIE-10 disease codes U07.1 to deaths with confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 infection laboratory to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection laboratory. The rate of lethality reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a specified time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall rate of lethality is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) as at 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of lethality in patients diagnosed (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of lethality in people infected, which reflects the percentage of people infected (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics do not depend on time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, their presence can provide information on how many people were infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small villa of 4600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) already died.
In Gangelt, her disease spread during the carnival festivals and affected the youngest, thus there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths by COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been exceeded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined by blood donors.
It has been confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died of COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those who are in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is narrowed only at the age of 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in males and 1.7 in females.
The exact reasons for this gender difference are not known, but could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Immunological differences based on sex, the smallest number of women smoking, and the fact that males have co-ordinated conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age could have contributed to the highest mortality rate in males.
In Europe, 57% of infected people were males and 72% of those who died by COVID-19 were males.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track information on sex in infections with the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and RAG, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, in particular nursing staff, are women, and are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to crown, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international recommendations sobe name to prevent stigmatization. The virus causing COVID-19 is called coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the virus of COVID-19" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
It is common that "coronavirus" is used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and water respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV as temporary names for the virus and disease, according to 2015 indication of not using locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal hyspos and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed the ventilator valve and the provider could not deliver it in the required time, a local emerging company carried out reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves during the night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and disinformation emerged about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease that quickly spread over the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no medicines or vaccines approved to treat the disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are conducting international research on vaccines and drugs for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Test" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four most promising antiviral compounds in terms of efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are under investigation.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of this virus, whether inactive or dead, aims to generate a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the virus of COVID-19.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on protein S that helps the virus get into the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA vaccines or RNAs, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines in any of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and effectiveness. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle began.
The vaccine contains an innocent copy of the virus genetic code that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based improvement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Rehabilitated antiviral drugs constitute most of the Chinese research, including nine phase III trials on remdesivir in several countries and due to report by the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on the vaccine and possible drugs against COVID-19 was under way. Several antiviral medicines for the treatment of COVID-19 are evaluated, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence of the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compassionate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquin, which was previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020. The results were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for the investigation.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency authorisation for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the initial barley of the S protein performed by type 2 transmembranary serine-protease (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The release of cytokines can be a complication of the last stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines. The Chinese National Health Commission included tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a national non- randomized phase II test in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that, in combination with a blood test of serum ferritin to identify cytokine releases, it counteracts these effects, which are believed to be the cause of death of some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleucin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of cytocin-resistant steroid-release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with unconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action through which passive antibodies treatment can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cellular cytotoxicity dependent on antibodies or fagocytosis.
Other forms of passive treatment with antibodies are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
Convalestive serum production, consisting of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and containing specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve faster distribution.
Coronavirus disease, a group of closely related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Central Hospital, who subsequently died of COVID-19 after raising awareness of the spread of the virus.
