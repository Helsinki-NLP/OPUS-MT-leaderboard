A 9-year-old boy in Tampere was found.
The police have had a search mission due to a 9-year-old boy's escape on Tuesday night in Tampere.
The report on the disappearance of a boy from Western Tampere with his friend has been disseminated in social media.
According to the police station, there's been a connection with the boy, and he's not in danger of life and health.
The boy's father told him at the middle of the night, that he's been found.
He's all right, and now we're going to start the post-explanatory.
The boy was found in the surroundings of the house, Dad told me.
Ronaldo, again in the wild, broke the paint difference to the Mess.
Christiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish League on the weekend and continued his factory work in the Master League.
The battle between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo over the league of the Masters was at least a moment in the interest of the latter.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo moved alone to the top of the painter statistics of all time when he shot the visitor Shahtar Donetsk's network two hits of punishment kicks and one of the game situations.
Ronaldo raised his painted aldoon to 80, when before Tuesday with him, the Barcelona Mess, who was reequivocating with him, had 77 hits.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus has been struggling in the Italian football team in Serie A since the beginning of the season, but in the Master's League's D section, it started vigorously with 2-1-victims from Manchester City.
The victory hall made a lot of ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack bored Sergei Aguero's absence.
Aguero, wounded at the game of the valioliga at the end of the week, only came to the field in the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second company United also experienced hard hits in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after 1-2 loss.
The visit of the 20-year-old ManU, Luke Shaw, took only 15 hours.
PSV's dangerous-looking glitter of Hector Moreno hit the target on the ManU package that was attacked so bad that Shaw probably broke the weather.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's homestadium ten minutes before medical personnel left to transport him to hospital care.
Memphis Depay took the guests in 41 minutes to 1-0, but the pleasure of ManU took only a few minutes.
Moreno evened before a break in an extra time.
In the second half of the time, the PSV's winning score was made by Luciano Narsingh.
A section of Paris Saint-Germain began in the League of Masters of the Season of Art.
There was an Argentine Angel Di Maria, who changed the PSG-nuted shirt in Manchester United.
Di Maria broke through the right and raised the ball across the back of Malmo's goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani made a second half PSG 2-0.
The PSG has been betted on by the successors of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö is not the best possible reference point in the League's small series.
Zlatan Ibrahimovic, a PSG star attacker, first encountered his professional career as a result of Malmö FF.
Ibrahimovic began his career in Malmo in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes when his team in Moscow TsSKA lost the B block in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party immediately called for a divorce - the president made the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, made the same speech he had made a month ago.
Mr Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, has again given the same speech he gave at the end of last month in Parliament.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently did not realize that the speech was the same.
The speech raised doubts as to whether the 91-year-old Mugabe was fully alive.
MDC's main opposition party called on Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe's assistants rushed to say that the confusion had occurred only at Mugabe's precinct and that the president had done nothing wrong.
The speech of Mugabe discussed the impact of China on the country's economy earlier and now.
Germany and Austria want an additional summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an additional summit of EU leaders for the next week because of the refugee crisis.
The request will be evaluated by Donald Tusk, President-in-Office of the European Council at the summits.
According to German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state leaders should discuss cooperation with countries of origin and how to register more effectively in Europe.
The negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are, according to Mr Merkel, at the table of the Interior Ministers.
Professor admits on an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend.
Professor Shannon Lamb of the University asked for an emergency call to sound at the police of a little bit shaken up at home and told me that he shot his girlfriend.
Lamb mentioned in particular that their beloved dog was there and alive and probably scared. The professor told me that the contact details of the dead woman's family were on the woman's phone.
The police inside the house found the body of Amy Prentiss and the message written on the white paper: "I'm very sorry and I hope I could cancel what I did. I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me," Lamb's letter read according to the authorities.
There was no sign in the house that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Mississippi Cleveland, had already traveled 500 km away to the school campus. The police found Ethan Schmidt, a historian who was held dead at the door of the campus, who was believed to have been shot by Lamb.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said that the university officials received information about shooting at 10:18 in the morning.
He said Lamb called a fatal emergency call for a while after this.
There was another death in the day, and Lamb took his own life when the police reached him.
The next day, students and teaching staff remained visusti behind locked doors, and the authorities still tried to find out Lamb's motives.
The researchers explored the details in both locations, and Lamb's acquaintances taught about the man. The researchers were born with a picture of a talented but perhaps a troubled teacher.
Students always said they were looking forward to the professor's hours.
According to the police of the Prentiss County, Gautir, the professor had no previous history of violence or crime.
Schmidt, for his part, had mentioned Lamb's book, which had given recognition to "the miraculous people", with whom he was allowed to spend academic life.
Both worked at the Institute of Social Sciences and History, with 17 teachers, and many of the students participated in the courses of both men.
However, references to the problems emerged.
Lambia student Brandon Beavers told me that the professor seemed excited and nervous, "like he had something wrong."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had told him in the end of the year 2014-2015 that he was suffering from stress.
Lamb had previously applied for sick leave from Delta State University because of some kind of health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's hiring policy meant that a doctorate for which Lamb had worked hard would not automatically guarantee him the post of assistant professor.
University Director William LaForge told me that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lambia was clearly in trouble with something.
These questions can no longer be answered by Lamb.
After leaving the campus, the police found out what route Lamb had come from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Before the police reached Lamb, he had taken his life with a 38 - caliper gun in the backyard of the house in Mississippi, Greenville, about a mile away from his parents' home, said Methel Johnson, the D.C. D.C.
Lamb's car was still running on the yard.
The police didn't immediately find out why Lamb had just gone to this house, but Johnson told me he believed that he knew the people in the house.
He spent his youth in the area.
Lamb began work as a teacher of science and education at a university with 3,500 students. There were 12,000 inhabitants in the city in 2009 .
In the spring, he got a doctoral degree in education.
One of Lamb's longest friends described this as intelligent, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston told me that she met Lamb through common friends when she was 15 and Lamb 20 years old.
He was still in high school with his friends, and Lamb was an interesting older guy who tried to teach Hairston guitar play for years.
"The Lamb was then quite a heartbreaker.
All the girls were in her way," said Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Jackson's suburb in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently dated for a while.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but no document says they're not married.
Couple of them had a dog named Lightning, and they lived in a brick house in a river-sweet in Gautir's little town.
The police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told me that he was divorced from Prentiss 15 years ago. The couple had remained friends, and they have a daughter who is now 19.
"He was totally upset," O'Steen said about his daughter.
"The daughter and mother were the best friends."
O'Steen hadn't met Lamb but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb liked music and played blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met when Lamb and Abigail appeared in both summer events three years ago.
Later, they also called together.
O'Steen says his daughter composes and plays his own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for many companies through the network.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the modest The Julep Room restaurant outside Gautiere, said that he saw Lamb and Prentiss on 5 September, when Lamb had played guitar and lipstick to a fragile audience.
Nothing said that something had been wrong.
"Happy couple," Shaffer said.
"We were joking together.
Both had a good sense of humor."
"Professor Schmidt, who was killed, directed the first year seminars and specialized in the history of Indians and colonial times," said English Professor Don Allan Mitchell.
She was married, and she had three little kids.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his own brotherhood and college.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, 900 people gathered for a memorial in the candlelight, including educational staff, other staff, students and residents of the region.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the evening event where the college choir presented the songs "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace."
Teaching will continue on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get students back," LaForge said.
"The crisis is over.
This is a healing day."
Amy and Rogelio Solis report on the Mississippi Cleveland.
Assisting journalists: Associated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville of Mississippi and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The case has been corrected, because the police now tell us that Lamb called an emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and it was further specified that although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife in an emergency call, there is no evidence of their marriage.
Toys R Us intends to hire less seasonal workers
The Toys R Us company will not hire as many seasonal workers as it did last year. However, the distributor of toys and babies products reports that it provides additional hours of work for its current workers and seasonal workers.
The company intends to hire 40 000 people to shops and distribution centres across the country, and in 2014 it hired 45,000 seasonal workers.
Most jobs are part-time.
The interviews will begin this month and the new employees will start in October to December.
Although there are still months for holidays, the season in the trade sector is approaching a good pace, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to shops and to ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "reffee" with Princess Diana.
The first night of the film's return to the future was an important moment for Michael J. Fox's career.
First night also had a personal significance.
"We sat in the theater and waited for the royals to arrive, and I noticed that there was an empty place next to me. I was illuminated that Princess Diana is coming next to me," Fox said to be coming in the trailer of the Back in Time document.
"When the movie started, I realized that the situation was very similar to a date with the Princess of Wales."
The Back in Time document is related to Return to the Future, and the document will also interview Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeck and producer Steven Spielberg.
The film came back to the future 30 years ago.
"This film is definitely for me for all the time travel film," Spielberg said.
Back in Time is published in VOD and DVD formats, and is presented in selected cinemas from October onwards.
Secretary-General of the United Nations: no military solution in Syria
Mr Ban Ki-moo, Secretary-General of the United Nations, commented on Russia's enhanced military efforts and noted that there is no military solution to the nearly five-year conflict and that weapons only bring more violence and suffering to millions of people.
The Secretary-General again called upon all parties, including the UN Security Council, to join forces and to support comprehensive negotiations to find a political solution.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ban reported on his intention to meet the five permanent members of the Security Council, the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, to discuss the situation in Syria, which would be later scheduled for the UN General Assembly's ministerial week this month.
Ban regretted the fact that the fragmentation of the Security Council, the Syrian people and the regional powers has caused a situation that is impossible to resolve.
Ban called on the five permanent Member States to show similar solidarity and unity in the context of the Syrian crisis, which reached the Iranian nuclear agreement.
Chapter 8 of the supportive studies: Is Donald Trump serious?
Trump has been tried to label him as an empty speaker.
He's also been thought to be a joke.
Some predict Trump's collapse.
Unsuccessful efforts have been made to pull Trump out of the gallup wire.
Ten of the eleven national gallups show Donald Trump two-digit support figures, some of which are already seriously considering what it actually tells about the prospects for a real estate model.
But the elections are only in the early stages.
No one has yet reported Trump being elected a Republican candidate.
Experts remind us that at this time in 2011 Rick Perry, at the gallup hub, was given space to the rising Herman Cain. Neither of them eventually won the candidate tuition in any state.
For many reasons, Trump would have difficulty in the general election.
External groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the Economic Conservative Group Club for Growth, have noted Trump's strong position and started digging his figure for his fall.
The following fresh gallup data show that the real estate mogul cannot be ignored with the shoulder hatch:
Trump's support has been full-fledged.
Just before Trump announced being a candidate in mid-June, according to the Monmouth University gallup, only two out of ten Republicans had a positive picture of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, 40% already had a positive picture.
At the beginning of August, the corresponding share was 52 per cent.
Now six out of ten Republicans have a positive image of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten images are negative.
These figures are also considered in the states where elections are held first.
In the Quinnipiac Gallup last week, 60% of Republicans had a positive view of Trump.
Two thirds of the Republicans would be pleased with Trump's nomination.
At the CNN and ORC poll last week, 67 per cent of Republicans said they were very pleased or satisfied with Trump's possible election as a candidate.
Only two out of ten would be extremely unhappy with Trump's nomination.
Ben Carson will achieve almost as enthusiastic reception as Trump (43 per cent would be very pleased with Carson's nomination and 40 per cent Trump's nomination).
Who's next the most popular candidate?
Thirdly, Marco Rubio, with a similar share of 21 per cent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republicans would be unhappy or very unhappy if Jeb Bush were elected candidate for the party.
Most Republicans do not consider Trump's temperament to be problematic.
Donald Trump has been widely criticized for power and offensive comments. 52% of Republican supporters across the country consider the properties of the real estate model appropriate to the president.
The same is true of Iowa, where the first party meeting will be held: according to Quinnipiac-Galup, 52% of Republicans consider Trump's personal qualities to be suitable for the chief of the defence forces.
However, according to the ABC and Post gallup, 44 per cent believe that Trump is unable to function effectively, and six out of ten consider Trump's temperament unsuitable for the White House.
The Republicans are getting used to the idea.
They're starting to take Trump seriously.
When the Republicans are asked who is most likely to be elected candidate for the party, according to the CNN and ORC gallup, four out of ten believe in Trump's potential.
The situation has changed since mid-July, when four out of ten would have put their money on Jeb Bush's behalf.
Total: Republicans have not had a very reliable crystal ball before.
At this stage, in the last elections, four out of ten Republicans considered Rick Perry a likely candidate, and only 28% of Mitt Romney.
The majority seems to think Trump's campaign is convincing.
Although the Republicans would support another candidate, Trump covers almost all the other candidates.
Some experts believe that the divided camp is likely to benefit Trump when Trump's opponents are divided into the supporters of different candidates.
At the beginning of September, the University of Monmouth's viewpoint revealed that Trump and almost any other Republican group in the fictional two-way competition would almost always have a greater support.
He leads Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubiota at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points each.
With Ted Cruz, he's even.
Is Cruz Trump the only real opponent?
Ben Carson would take the win from Trump to 19 points at the fictional two-way competition.
A small majority of Trump's supporters have already reported that they have taken a decision on the vote.
According to the CBS and NYT's Tuesday poll, just half of Trump's supporters are sure of their vote.
Of course, the situation can change for many reasons, and at the moment a certain voter can also change his mind.
46% of Trump's supporters have not made a final decision.
Trump's very rival for this moment is neurosurgery Ben Carson, but the voters who have already elected their candidates are twice more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans agree with Trump's view of migration.
After Donald Trump's call for a campaign speech two months ago, immigrants from Mexico who were raped, migration has been a hot topic in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's powerful speeches deport important Latin American voters from the Republican forces and impede the renewal of the brand.
According to the results of ABC News and Washington Post, six out of ten Republicans are on migration issues, however, on the same lines with Trump.
As long as the migration is in the light bowl, so is Donald Trump.
The dissatisfaction with the government is at its peak.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are currently collecting about half of the Republican votes. The recommendation significantly increases the fact that both of them have come to stand outside.
The Republican forces want a fresh face instead of a political bankruptcy. According to ABC News and Washington Post's latest opinion measurement, this was the view of the Republicans in six out of ten.
These two candidates are also angry with Washington.
According to the opinion measurements of Des Moines Register and Bloomberg in Iowa, three of the four Republicans in Iowa have been frustrated at the Republicans' activities in Congress: 54% are unhappy and 21% on the edge of rage."
Jeremy Corbyn's debyyt at the Prime Minister's Question Time
After the elections, Mr Corbyn's first meeting at the Prime Minister's Question Time has been eagerly awaited.
The Labour Party's new picture of Jeremy Corbyn is about to rise for the first time to consider his powers at David Cameron's Question Time later.
Corbyn puts up the first six questions a little after the middle of the day, and the media and the workers' representatives are following a man's eye hard.
Corbyn's been after less theater and more facts for a weekly show.
He has also stated that he can skip some of the sessions and leave them to his colleagues.
In the face of Corbyn's leadership, Corby will be weighed for the first time in connection with the parliamentary test, which will now take place following the meeting of the shadow government and after his speech at the annual meeting of the Corbyn Trade Unions at the TUC.
The decision of the Labour Party to silence the 75th anniversary of the British Air War on Tuesday's national song has been criticised by a number of representatives of the Tory Party.
Corbyn's silence during the national song attracted attention
The representative of Corbyn stated that Corbyn's standing national song, while respecting in silence the hero of the Royal Air Forces in the Battle of Britain.
However, Mr Owen Smith, a member of the Corbyn shadow government, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight programme that he would have called on the party's leader to join the national song despite the opposition to this monarchy.
The ten shadow ministers have refused to join Corbyn's number one, calling for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, and less than one half of the party initially supported the selection of Corbyn to the party's leadership.
The correspondent for BBC's policy, Robin Brant, believes that political differences on the membership of the UK and the tightening of the government's conditions for granting benefits have increased in the Labour Party following the appointment of Corbyn.
At the TUC meeting, Corbyn said that Labour intends to propose changes to eliminate restrictions entirely.
A few hours later, the Minister for Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, Smith, said that the party's position is very clear: it only opposes the government's plans to lower the border from 26 000 to 23 000 pounds.
Corbyn is the fifth Labour Director, whom David Cameron meets over the past decade under the leadership of the Tory Party.
The new approach to the policy promised Labour Director says he chose questions to Cameron on 30 000 proposals from the public.
According to Corbyn, elected from the Islington North district, there are too many controversies, and he promises to avoid clever speech and loaning, and says that he will instead focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and youth challenges.
Corbyn has stated that Shadow Minister Angela Eagle is holding him in questioning hours, for example when Cameron is on his way abroad.
Mr Corby has also put the idea that others may also be able to speak at times, and he says that he has discussed this with Mr Bercow, President of the Chamber.
After Corbyn joined the party leadership in 2005, Cameron said that he wanted a doll theater policy, which is often linked to Question Time, but some years later he admitted that he failed in his efforts.
Since the first time in 1990, the question hour has been viewed as a key measure of the leader's judgmental capacity, the management of the sub-room and his position, but the criticisms say that the question hour has become a hustle that needs major reforms.
"Shot in Joburg": homeless young photographers
The centre of Johannesburg is a challenging environment for homeless people.
A meaningful way to learn and make money has been found for the former street group.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit description study that teaches homeless young people to photograph their homeland and to earn at the same time.
BBC News met a young man who has graduated through the project among the first ones.

Punta will be strengthened as British wages rise
Pound was strengthened as the wages rose in Great Britain, and SABMiller drew the FTSE 100 index to rise.
In May-July, salaries rose by 2.9 per cent in the UK compared to the corresponding period last year.
The fastest growth expected was the fastest since 2009.
The price was increased by 1%, and the rate was quoted at $1.5505, while the price was also increased in relation to the euro, and it was quoted at EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose by 1.49% and ended at 6.229.21 points.
The largest increase was made by SABMiller, whose course suffered by 20 % when the company received a preliminary offer from the competing company AB InBev.
When the trade was carried out, it would combine two of the world's largest bakery companies and bring under the same roof brands, including, for example, Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share increased by 0.9 per cent in the positive results of the competitive Richemont group focusing on luxury products.
Richemont's most recent sales figures are better than forecasts. Sales developments were also leading to an increase in Burberry's key market in China.
Glencore's share increased by 5 per cent of its reported mining waste plans to collect $2.5 billion by share as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of Mond's packing and paper group were the largest drop in 4,3 % when Goldman Sachs dropped the company's price for sales purposes.
JD Sports' course rose by 3.1 per cent after the sporting company informed that its income before taxes rose by 83 per cent to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports boss: higher wage costs could hinder expansion
According to Mr Peter Cowgill, the chairman of JD Sports' Management Group, the raising of minimum wages in the United Kingdom would mean more purchasing power for potential customers.
However, increased purchasing power is not sufficient to cover the company's higher labour costs.
According to Cowgil, rising labour costs could jeopardise JD Sports' enlargement plans and reduce the need for additional workforce.
Metcash is launching a grass root campaign against Ald's waxing
Metcash seeks to secure its IGA sales from the power of Ald in South and West Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a grass-roots campaign to maintain the market share of IGA retailers in South and West Australia against Aldi's $700 million investment in Australia.
Aldi intends to open two distribution centres and the first up to 120 stores in South and West Australia at the beginning of next year. Metcast and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build IGA brands in mainstream communications and social media and by organizing events such as Adelaide show.
IGA shops, suppliers and many brands are involved in the campaign. For example, Simmo, an ice cream factory in Dunsborough, offers tastes in IGA shops, and traders sell tickets to their customers for South Australian football club games at a discount price.
Metcash is expected to publish more detailed information on its defence strategy on 29 September, when the food, alcohol and iron trade hub will organize an annual investment strategy day.
This is a significant market, since South and West Australia account for almost 30% of footprints of Metcash's IGA stores, and in these areas the ceiling is higher than the IGA sales network in the eastern Länder.
South and West Australian consumers are known for their corners, and IGA traders have a significantly higher market share in the region than in NSW, Victoria and Queensland. South Australia has a market share of 30 % and West Australia has a 24 % share, while in eastern states they account for only 14 %.
For example, Morgan Stanley's analysts believe that Aldi will catch 5% of the food market in these two Länder within 12 months of opening the first stores. Ketju eats sales from all operators, but in particular from non-chain operators.
This week, Morgan Stanley's analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA dealers can be sold at 360 million and Metcash's 250 million dollar lodge by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South and West Australia next year and will reach the sale of $500 million and $600 million in these areas.
The fixed costs of Metcash are high, so the loss of food sales and volume may result in a loss of $13 million before interest and taxes, Kierath notes.
At the same time, Metcast is losing market share in eastern states, mainly for Ald and Coles, although Roy Morgan's recent study shows that IGA customers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, by 4.1 per cent in 2017 and by 2.1 per cent in 2018, from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group's leading briefcase manager Hamish Douglass told Melbourne that he considered it highly likely that Metcash would disappear completely within ten years.
Metcash has refused to take a public position on Douglass' comments.
It is understandable that a member of the Metcash Government contacted Douglas last week.
Since 2010, IGA's market share has fallen from 18 % to 14 %, and the result of Metcash's 1200 resellers' food business has decreased by 43 % from the 2012 level.
However, the wholesale trader takes countermeasures and makes an annual $150 million to meet Coles and Woolworths' prices for hundreds of products per week. Ketju wants to support traders in the renovation of stores so that they can increase the supply of fresh products and improve the food selection of their own brands.
According to Ian Morrice, CEO of Metcash, price review and shop reform plans are at a good rate, and the company will be able to increase its profit again in 2017 for the first four years.
The president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy, defends Thanasi Kokkinak
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves his behavior rather than criticism.
According to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation, Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis has been a side-victim in the recent Nick Kyrgyz jupakos, who deserves special attention instead of criticism.
The two younger members of the "Special K" duo were unfavorable in lightning when the evil boy Kyrgyz was provoking his opponent Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal ATP tournament.
Soon after that, the judge was forced to separate the race partners from the Cincinnati in the Cokkinakis and Ryan Harrison. "Wawrinkan should have turned his back on the Kyrgyzians and my friend," Harrison said.
In the open US, Kokkinakis was frustrated at the field when powerful cramps ruined his match. Healy has faithfully defended the Kokkinak.
At the moment, the teenage star is in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second second champion of single games, Bernard Tomic, in the Davis Cup semifinal against Britain.
"I strongly believe that Thanasi has been challenged," Healy said.
"He broke the bat when he lost the match in the open United States. He is not the first player to break his bat because of frustration. I know Thanas very well that he is not proud of his work.
However, he has endured very well, for example, Harrison's provocative use of the United States' openness, and I think he deserves recognition.
He has a strong team and a splendid family around him, and I think he's just been treated a little unfairly.
He's very mature for 19 years, he's doing a lot of work and complementing a very good team. He's never had any problems with other players, and he's being respected among the players. He's practicing hard, he's in good health and really stable and mature young man. I think he should be evaluated on the basis of his own seamen."
Healy also supported the decision to drop Kyrgyz from the Australian team from an important round beginning on Friday. Healy describes the solution as a joint decision for all parties. However, he supports Canberra's return to the team's long-term strengthening.
"First, we want to focus fully on the struggles instead of the polemics associated with Kyrgyzstan," Healy said.
Nick has risen to the top quickly. As Federer and Murray among others have pointed out, the young man is forced to grow up in the lights of publicity. He deserves the criticism of his bad mistakes. However, we are trying to support him to understand the consequences of his actions. We are also trying to arrange for him his own peace. I believe that it is best for both the whole team and Nick."
European Migrant Crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders, arrests migrants
Hungary, which declared the emergency, closed its southern border from the direction of Serbia on Tuesday and caught unlawful scouts, which was intended to prevent the flow of migrants.
There was a chaos at the border when hundreds of migrants grew to no-one, and the Serbian authorities reacted furiously.
People fleeing violence were forced to remain on the roadway between inspection stations for an unspecified period of time
The depletion began to rise to the surface.
As the police helicopter flew above the migrants, they said, "Open the border!" and shouted rallies to the Hungarian riot police.
Some of them started protesting for eating and drinking.
The Serbian Foreign Minister announced that it did not accept the return of migrants to Hungary at the same time as more arrivals from Macedonia and Greece.
"Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not to increase damage.
The situation must be discussed in the coming days in Brussels and in other countries," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The conduit on the Hungarian-Serbia border began day later when the 28-state group failed to develop a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the Ministers agreed that responsibility for the flooding of 40 000 asylum seekers in Italy and Greece is common, and at the meeting there was a hope that by next month or the end of the year an agreement would be reached on which EU Member States would receive 120 000 migrants, including Hungary.
On Tuesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria invited an additional summit to be held for the next week in order to discuss the immigrant crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary did not wish to take immediate action in Brussels or neighbouring countries.
On Tuesday, the emergency took place so that in two southern regions, the authorities were allowed to use more effective means of closing you down and speeding up legal processes in asylum matters.
At the same time, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that Hungary is also planning a pipeline to the Romanian border to prevent the flow of migrant flow from that direction, now that the Serbian border is already ready for a fence.
CBS News' correspondent Charlie D'Agata reported that even prisoners participated in the tender for the finalisation of the Hungarian-Serbia wirework.
In recent months, Hungary has become a clear bottleneck and transit point for migrants to the European Union, many of whom are refugees from Syria and elsewhere from the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban argued that most of the people who arrived are refugees at the standard of living, not soldiers who have the right to seek security, and that the view differs sharply from the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
According to the new law that entered into force in Hungary at midnight, there is a crime that exceeds or damages the four-metre-high barbed wire that the government has built at the southern border in the direction of Serbia, which also defines longer prison periods for convicted human traffickers.
"As a result of the situation caused by mass migration, the government is declaring a state of crisis," Zoltan Kovacs, the government's informant, told journalists in Szeged in the south of the country.
"We follow a strict line: illegal crossing is a crime."
In practice, Parliament still needs to accept military action, which is expected next week. Associated Press News Office suppliers on the border have seen heavily armed soldiers with their vehicles and military dogs for several days.
The Orban Internal Security Adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said that the authorities have taken 45 border crossings immediately at the border and 15 beyond.
They're now under police control, and they're being charged with crimes on the basis of new laws.
The authorities will quickly repair the fence.
In addition, the Hungarian authorities closed two of the seven border crossing points at the Serbian border on Tuesday, and one border crossing point was closed by means of a train wagon covered with wire.
Caos dominated the main border crossing point near Roszke in Hungary when the Hungarians opened a small metal box where people were packed in.
About 20 of them fit in, but thousands of them were out.
The second group of migrants blocked the main street, which connects Serbia and Hungary, and the people said they were in the eating and drinking bar until they were allowed to go to Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's leadership compared to Bernie Sanders reduced by the national gallup
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton's share of support is still two-digit in the race as a national presidential candidate for the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders has closed the distance.
Clinton's support now stands at 47% of the votes of democrats (down from 58%), while Sanders is second with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced his possible departure to the presidential race, and his support among the Democrats is 15%.
More than five months before the premieres for most of the democrats, it is too early to tell who they are in favour of.
However, Clinton's supporters are more confident than other candidates in their choice.
After the CBS News gallery last month, Clinton has lost the support of a number of democratic groups, while the Sanders camp has joined new supporters.
Clinton still has a strong leadership among women and the moderates, but the leadership has narrowed.
Clinton's support among men has fallen significantly, and he has only a five-percent staircase vis-à-vis Sanders.
Clinton has lost his leadership among democrats under the age of 50, and he is now in line with Sanders.
However, Clinton still has a clear advantage among the electorate.
Last month, Clinton's advance in support of the Sanders among the Liberals was double-digit, but now Sanders has taken five percentage points to Clinton in this group.
Approximately half of the Democrats will be happy to support Clinton if he is elected candidate for the party.
The fourth would support Clinton with small reservations, and 15% would support him just because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support Clinton.
It is no surprise that the current supporters of Clinton would be particularly zealous supporters even if he is elected as a candidate.
There is more disintegration among those who are not in favour of Clinton at the moment, and only about a quarter would support him zealously.
Forty-eight per cent of the democratic voters would be in favour of Clinton, and only 35 per cent of the Republican voters would be zealously in favour of Donald Trump, the most popular Republican voter.
When Clinton's voters are asked freely to describe why they support his nomination, the most popular justification is Clinton's right experience (16 per cent). The second most popular answer is that it is time to elect a female president (13 per cent) and the third is that Clinton is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also mention his connection with Bill Clinton (9%).
In addition, there are common views and opportunities to win the actual elections.
The Vice-President is still squeezing his possible nomination, and 57% of the voters would like him to join the race, but the third would prefer to leave him out of the race.
When the second most popular candidate for the party is asked to be a candidate for democratic voters, most of them choose Biden.
After Clinton, more than half of Clinton's supporters, Biden is the second most popular candidate and significantly more popular than Sanders.
If Biden doesn't go to the Democratics' candidate race, Hillary Clinton will raise his advance towards Sanders, with Sanders taking 20 percentage points, and it will grow to 30 percentage points if Sanders doesn't go to the race.
55% of the voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the real elections, but the share has fallen from 78% last month.
The second Biden is far from Clinton, but more believes in Biden's chances of winning the real elections.
However, democratic voters consider views on issues of interest to be more important than the winning opportunities of candidates.
The voters do not like any democratically motivated or potential candidates to be unacceptable.
The voters consider democratic leaders or potential candidates appropriate.
Most people consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, trustworthy and leaders.
Biden is often described as being honest, while Clinton is most often considered to be a leader.
Even 30% of the democratic voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable, in turn 15 percent of Sanders. 27% do not know whether Sanders is honest.
The Democrats believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden's views are close to the ideology of the voters.
For all the qualities around a quarter, there is no opinion about Sanders.
When the voters are asked about the views of Hillary Clinton's private e-mail and his own server as Foreign Minister, most of the voters say they are pleased with Clinton's explanation and have not changed the view of these voters on Clinton.
The Americans disagree more widely.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with Clinton's report, and there's only a third of them.
The people's opinions were divided in March, when the conflict had just become public.
The majority of Americans believe that the use of controversial emails has not affected their overall picture of Clinton. 36 percent say that the image has changed in a negative direction.
Of this 36%, the majority, six out of ten, are Republicans.
Although the voters of their own party regard Clinton as honest and reliable, there is room for improvement in these qualities when asking for the views of all voters: Clinton is considered honest and reliable only 32%, which is 8 percentage points less than last month and 15 percentage points less than in May.
62% of all voters do not think Clinton is honest and reliable.
On the other hand, 55% of all voters across the country do not regard Trump as honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump receive good ratings from leadership.
The six candidates for Biden, Carson and Bush were considered the most reliable.
Most people think Sanders is honest, but as with Carson, many people don't have the opinion of Sanders.
The survey sample is 351 voters and the error margin is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson catches Donald Trump's headway in a national stand-by poll
According to the latest CBS News and New York Times survey, Ben Carson has achieved Donald Trump.
These two candidates were more than half of the votes in the new questionnaire, leaving the other candidates far behind.
Among the Republican voters in the whole country, Trump still has strong support. The share of support has risen from 23 % of the CBS survey held before the Fox News debate last month.
However, Carson's support would lead to a sharp increase in the same period, from 6% to 23%.
According to the survey, Carson has a strong support for all population groups, and in the higher education group, he defeats Trump.
Other candidates, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, will remain far away. Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is weak and has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio to Florida shared the third place with a 6% support.
The error margin in the sample of 376 Republican voters is 6% in direction or in direction, and the survey was carried out in September.
According to the latest survey published last week by CNN and ORC, Carson's support is on the rise, with 19 per cent of Republicans supporting Trump's support being 32 per cent.
Also in the latest ABC News and Washington Post survey, Trump was clearly in charge of Carson.
In the last week's meeting of men, Trump filed unsuccessful charges against a retired neurosurgeon, but Carson apologized after questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said on Saturday in his campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the constituency accused of the death of Baruch College fux
Nearly two years ago, after the death of a student at the ritual of the constituency in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people are counted as murder charges.
Baruch College (City University of New York) members of the Pi Delta Ps branch brutally assaulted Chun "Michael" Deng in September 2013. According to the police, the branch did not deliver Deng in time to the hospital, which was considered to have contributed to his death.
According to the authorities, the victim's eyes had been tied, his back had been put on an almost 15-kilometre sand-filled bag and his attack had been repeatedly used in his attempt to reach a target that had been placed on the other side of the ice field.
Deng is first reported to have complained of headaches and then lost consciousness.
According to the police, members of the Pi Delta Ps section didn't call the emergency number when Deng lost consciousness, and they allegedly waited an hour before Deng was taken to the hospital.
Officer Chris Wabner told me at the press conference that members, however, had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms and contact the president Andy Meng.
"At this stage, members began to hide the instruments, putting the benefit of the branch ahead of Michael Deng's health," Wagner said.
Deng wasn't recovered, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy protocol, Deng had been beaten several times in the head, in the upper body and in the thighs with a boring object.
"Too many families have been shocked by the fact that at least one student per year has died as a result of the induction since 1970," says Deng's family lawyer Douglas Fierberg in his opinion.
The parties and their members must be held accountable where the authorities must take an important step.
The grand jury in Monroe County filed five members of the congregation to be charged with the murder of third degrees.
In addition, 32 members of the constituencies are charged with dismissal and criminal conspiracy, including Meng.
"We want to have equal responsibility, not only for individuals, but also for an official or informally approved organization," Wagner told us at the press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College set the division's operating ban and the national branch dismissed the local department's activities.
This is how the rise in interest rates of the United States Central Bank (Fed) affects
The interest rate rise and the increase in the stock market were weakened, the return on securities rises and the economy slips into depression.
We know that.
We do not know how long everything takes and how long the effects will last.
In particular, with regard to the economy, we find a timeline in history.
Lama has arrived up to 11 months after the first interest rate rise and lasted up to 86 months.
The central bank often raises aggressively interest rates, though not always. The determining factor is how economic and financial assets react.
Therefore, the central bank officials have already strongly stressed that investors would not pay attention to the start of raising interest rates but to how long it takes to normalise the situation.
There are, of course, a number of variables involved.
Finally, however, market operators may note that all the humiliation associated with interest increases may be exaggerated.
"The first rise of the Central Bank after the global financial crisis was undoubtedly often interpreted as a sign of the end of cheap money," Julian Jessop, Capital Economics' chief global economist told his customers.
On the other hand, we do not expect the gradual normalisation of interest rates to a fairly low level, which is a scary shock for many.
However, that does not mean that there would be no effects.
Here are examples of historical trends in how the effects can be seen in different economic areas:
As has been seen on the market for about a month, the increase in interest rates can increase the volatility for some time.
When interest finally rises, the effect is not so dramatic.
‘The trend would appear to be the stagnation of capital interest gains after the first increase for 12 to 24 months, perhaps reflecting a delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank's analyst stated in a recent study on the consequences of the increase in interest rates.
Over 35 years, the market is generally seen as a sharp increase at the time of the increase in interest rates, about 14 per cent, a fairly steady increase in the following 250 days (mean increase of 2,6 per cent), after 500 days the situation normalises, and the average interest rate return after the sixth share rate is 14,4 per cent, says Bob Doll, chief equity strategy of the Nuveen Asset Management in Barron's magazine.
According to Deutsche, the impact on shares is generally increased at a slightly later stage of the cycle and interest returns are starting to decline.
Lama is a fact in the economy, but the increase in interest rates usually works on it.
In this case, if the central bank meets conditions that did not exist before and could speed up the downturn.
Particular attention is given to the fact that gross domestic product is the lowest ever in view of the rise in the central bank's steering rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 rate of steering rate raised since 1950, only twice the nominal value was less than 4.5 per cent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 shows 3.6 per cent, many did not imagine it to be sustainable, and in the third quarter there is 1.5 per cent, the regional central bank of Atlanta reports.
In such a sensitive economic situation, interest raises may be at risk and may ask whether this situation is different, said Deutsche.
On the market, operators have spoken of the increase in the steering rate throughout the year, and the views will therefore turn to the meeting of this week's Open Market Committee (Federal Open Market Committee), which will end on Thursday.
Many strategic and economists believe that even if the Open Market Committee would accept an increase at this meeting, there is only a 25% probability of future trade.
"In our surveys since 1950, all climbing cycles to date have been in a supercycle, in which GDP that falls before the downturn also rises very quickly after the rise rate begins," the report states.
The recovery has been very slow compared to the worst decay in the comparative period.
The cycle is clearly the longest that the central bank has waited for since the last break. The record had been 35 months, now it is going 74 months.
In addition, fixed-income securities have been unstable in the market's past interest rate gains, and the pattern is also repeated on the capital side.
"The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on shares when the central bank changes the rate.
In the case of bonds, the return appears to change the direction immediately when the first upward/downward cycle starts.
At the end of the climbing cycle, profits will decrease immediately," said Deutsche.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that long-term and short-term bonds will bring each other closer and smoother.
"High-profit bonds often do better in such an environment, even though we are still cautious about profits," said Schwab's analyst of fixed-profit securities, Kathy Jones.
Interestingly, according to Jones, the market has already adapted to the future change in the direction of the central bank.
"In addition to the dollar's strengthening and inflation forecasts, there are already several signs of tightening financial policy," Jones says.
Short-term interest rates are rising, the return curve is direct, the credit risk margins have expanded and volatility has increased, all of which are typical on the market in a situation where the central bank tightens policy.
Widely speaking, companies that operate mainly on the US market benefit because the level of interest is falling and local products are starting to attract.
The prospects of encumbered multinational corporations are weaker, as the stronger dollar makes their products expensive on the global market and the debts higher.
"History shows that quality shares are more profitable in the next three months," Goldman Sachs analysts tell their customers.
Undertakings with strong balance sheets beat weak balance sheet companies after interest rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of five percentage points.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility shares also managed better with lower quality, on average 4 and correspondingly 3 percentage points.
"It's a big question.
Companies with a significant share of the variable interest rate debt are losing the most," Goldman said.
Outside the stock market, consumers usually also benefit from the dollar's strengthening.
Savings also benefit from higher profits, although experts disagree on how quickly the effects are seen.
Parlamentary Andrew Bingham: BBC Radio 3 is a classic FM copy
Conservative Andrew Bingham criticizes the radio station for too much popularity.
Bingham says it's hard to separate the channel from its commercial competitor today.
It also claims the BBC Music Awards Award to be a copy of the Brits.
For his part, Parlamentariat Damien Collins is accusing The Voice of the inpersonality.
According to a significant parliamentarian, BBC Radio 3 gradually becomes a copy of Classic FM channel. The charges add pressure to the station to prove that they offer other commercial radio stations.
Conservative Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that the radio channel of the broadcasting company is becoming too populistic and that the channel is no longer separated from its commercial competitor.
"I don't want to talk about popularization, but Radio 3 seems to change in the direction of Classic FM," Bingham said.
The BBC Music Awards Award, held last December, also receives criticism from Bingham as part of:
"Last year, the first BBC Music Awards appears to be a copy of the Brits Award.
These two examples are that, instead of new and different, only imitate what is already on the market," Bingham says.
BBC's CEO denied the allegations and stated that BBC Radio 3 offers commercial competitors significantly more live music and enlightening content.
"From Radio 3, I learned from classical music that I can't learn from other channels.
The commitment of the channel to live music and music is entirely in its own class.
I also consider it important that Radio 3 is also committed to looking for new music and ordering new works," the Director-General said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 leader Alan Davey said that the station needs to work harder to maintain public interest, as the British are better acquainted with classical music.
However, Radio 3 is not the only hard way to get into commercial channels when the BBC channel has been criticised, in consultation with the limited Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
The Tory party's parlamentarism, Damien Collins, criticised the competition for The Voice, which BBC purchased from the Dutch producer Talpa Media. The trade price is estimated to be 22 million pounds.
"There is little discussion about the program, because it is not unique or specially distinguished."
According to Lord Hall, the program presented by BBC1, which was produced in a typical way for BBC by Paloma Faith and Boy George as a star performers.
In addition, Collins called on the company to look for a hit program in its own garage when it next launches a new entertainment series.
However, Collins did not agree to exclude the continuation of the The Voice series or the use of taxpayers' money in other entertainment formats.
The slowest increase in online trade in August — perhaps black Friday
In the first months of 2015, net sales increased by 7%.
Online trade sales have been statified since 2000. Last month, growth was the slowest ever.
The network trade was strengthened three years ago by mobile buying.
Experts believe that the black Friday of November can curb shopping.
For more than ten years, the continued conquest of online trade has desolated many of the British shopping streets.
According to experts, there are indications that network trade is stabilizing, and new sales figures show only 7% growth during the first three months of 2015.
In August, the overall sales growth was slower throughout the period since online sales have been statified, i.e. since 2000, and last year online sales grew by only five per cent.
According to experts, there are indications that network trade is stabilizing, and new sales figures show only 7% growth during the first three months of 2015.
"If we compare last year's growth with 2000 readings, it is clear that growth will stabilize over time," IMRG's main editor Andy Mulcahy told Guardian.
According to Mulcahy, online trade accelerated three years ago when consumers accepted mobile purchases.
"With it, more and more were able to buy the network, and for many it was possible to buy in a different environment, such as home control.
When mobile acquiring is now more moderate, growth can stabilize."
The black Friday from America is a phenomenon that is seen as one of the causes of slowing growth.
Experts say that the theme day to be held on the last Friday of November may cause consumers to postpone the purchase decision before black Friday.
Last year, five times the number of online buyers compared to normal caused many merchants to drop their websites.
Experts believe that a black Friday, which will cause consumers to intrude in after offers, can curb purchases at other times.
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, a fair pound per five pounds was spent online.
More than one third of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, are purchased from online shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of fashion shops.
The mechanic burys the casualties, Bin Laden's family is responsible.
The Muslims carried 29 victims' bodies on the streets when the first funeral was held in Mekka.
According to Saudi Arabia, the large construction company Saudi Binladin Group is part of the accident.
According to the Ministry of Health, 394 people were injured after the crane fell.
The bodies were carried in high air when the Muslims gathered together to bury 29 victims of the dragon who fell on the Great Keith of Mekka
The streets had gathered in a multitude of people dressed in white to say goodbye to the victims on their last journey to the cemetery of Al-Moasisem.
The mourner traveled through the sanctuary, where the fallen builder had only penetrated the roof of the mosque a day earlier on the Muslims.
The king of Saudi Arabia calls for the family company in the construction sector of Bin Laden to be responsible for an accident in which 394 persons were injured.
29 victims were transported to the streets in the accident of the Mekka's Great Scatter.
After the fall of the Nostur, there was Qasim Akram from the Bolton of the Great Manchester, who had traveled to Mecca on his first holy visit.
Akram had been with his parents in the Great Mosque who were starting their annual hajj-sac journey.
The Saudi Arabian authorities have promised that the Hajj pilgrimage will be organized when thousands of people are currently arriving in the city for pilgrimage.
According to King Salman, the Binladin Group should not have left the cranes up when the crane was not used.
According to the Arabian press release, the Binladin Group is a party to the accident.
The English-language service of the News Office did not report in detail, but according to the English-language bulletin, the group's management has been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to reveal what caused the crane to fall in the courtyard of the Great Mosque. Thousands of Muslims will be heading for the Great Mosque for the hajj-sacre later this month.
The Binladin Group has not published a report on the accident and the group's representatives have not been targeted for the opinion.
The King also accused the group of failing to comply with the updated safety regulations and cooperating with meteorological experts.
Ten elevators surrounded Mekka's Great Keijya as part of the huge construction project of the Binladin Group.
For decades, Bin Laden's family has had close contacts with the Saudi Arabian ruler family, and the Bin Ladens are responsible for several important construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader Osama bin Laden was an apostate boy whose family had abandoned in the 1990s.
An accident in heavy rain and heavy wind occurred only a few days before the pilgrimage to Mecca, which is the duty of every capable Muslim to do at least once in life.
According to the authorities, 158 people are still in hospital care.
The authorities provided a million ECU (EUR 250 000) for the victims' families and permanently handicapped.
Others injured in an accident receive half of the compensation.
B&Q boss says there's a cheap Eastern European labour force behind the phenomenon.
The British hire the generals of the home more often, says Veronique Laury.
These recommendations have been added by skilled workers from Eastern Europe, who are professionals.
More than 200 new Screwfix sales for workers will be opened.
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q sales around the country.
Text: Rupert Steiner, principal correspondent, Daily Mail
The British are said to be transferring their homework for hammering and painting to Eastern European players.
Hammering and painting skills seem to be scarce nowadays.
The British are now increasingly hiring home generals to handle home nickwork, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury is a new CEO at Kingfisher, who owns the home's shop chain of refurbishments. According to Laurie, the phenomenon is based on skilled workers from Eastern Europe who provide services at high prices.
As a result, Kingfisher intends to open 200 new Screwfix sales for traders. At the same time, 60 B&Q sales are closed.
Laury needs more women to work for B&Q stores, because eight out of ten shopping decisions at the store make a woman.
At the moment, most of the personnel are men.
According to Laurie, there is a need to take into account demographic trends, as nowadays more and more women living alone are rehabilitating their home.
"The staff of our sales are still mostly men," Laury says.
"We need to balance the situation.
Half of our customers are women, and 80% of the product purchase decisions make a woman.
Women play an important role in the decision-making process."
Laury is one of five women who are in the aftermath of companies in the British FTSE 100 index, and has also reorganized the company's management group to ensure that male and female leaders are equal.
Kingfisher is almost the only quality of its staff, with 50% of its staff being women, including the CEO and the Financial Director.
"This was a conscious decision. Multiplicity is an important issue for us," Laury told me.
"It hasn't been hard to find good women in the management team."
The turnover and sales figures of Kingfisher for six months are down, even though the company worked with strong strengths after the closure of the stores.
Kingfisher is responsible for the current trends: the company owns the Screwfix and B&Q chains and plans to open 200 new stores.
The three-Ace government decided to rely on compelling legislation to save the country's economy.
So the visible effects were made quite quickly.
The sharp head of the SGC and other employees' associations began to be forced immediately and as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the broad expression of workers' minds.
A lot of people think that's when it comes to making sense, too.
Let's ask if it's good for a strike, when it's bad anyway.
Even a resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people have already visited the Internet to report that they are not going to participate in the manifestation, but to go to work.
In the old good time of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no online where to protest, but openly declaring itself a scoundrel would have been a political suicide of a small person.
Millions of members of trade unions protested by a few ten thousand people not much for a moment, but it gives reason for thinking.
The position of the trade union movement is no longer as clear as it was twenty years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement as their own, values have changed
From the point of view of the interest of the Ay movement, the strong solutions of the government can also be seen as a direct gift to heaven.
When things have seemed to roll on their own weight for years, the unions are finally getting involved, namely, the workers' rights to defend, visually and properly.
In this way, the government may wish to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the trade union is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Let us be of any opinion about the activities of the organisations, so it's bullshit that Friday's expression of mind would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped for a long time.
For example, industrial production has already declined 31 months in a row.
Gross domestic product is still falling and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would make everyone's head.
Hard savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Objective 8.5 million savings, staff reduced by 130
The Lappeenranta Technical University begins with a savings facility, which aims to reduce expenditure by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of savings, the University will start all staff negotiations with an annual saving target of 6.5 million.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 employees.
In addition, the aim of other activities is to save two million.
In the context of the negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It is also affected by the budget cuts made by the government.
During this financial year, the University will produce some 2.6 million deficit results.
Expenditures will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by 2 million and the other funding by 3.2 million euros.
The university's overall budget is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between Massive teaching and research operations and the reduction of corporate funding with our university is very important, says Director Anneli Pauli in the University's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of the cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding appears in new dimensions.
Negotiations with trustees will be launched next week on Tuesday and will last six weeks by law.
Yle: Onnibus Wants Finland's Railways
Onnibus owner, British Sir Brian Souter tells Yle that the company is also targeting rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finland's rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest UK rail transport companies, Souter says.
Rail transport is to be gradually opened up to competition.
The first is the near traffic in the capital region in 2017-2018.
After nearby traffic, there's remote traffic.
Souter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport, Yle, will welcome the plans of Onnibus.
At least Transdev (formerly Veoli) has reported interest in rail transport by other international companies, which also has bus transport in Finland and rail transport elsewhere in Europe.
Time for the United States Central Bank's interest rate decision
The whole world will follow a meeting of the United States Central Bank Fed on Wednesday and Thursday, which will decide for the first time on the possible increase in interest rates for almost a decade.
Just half of the economists, who still believed last week that the central bank would raise interest rates, are now betting that the central bank will maintain interest rates at the current 0 to 0.25 %, as shown by the survey by Reuters 80 economic scientists.
"There is a historical situation in this case, because the central bank has kept the interest rate zero feeling for seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank can raise interest rates from zero and thus initiate normalisation of interest rates," said Peterson Institute for International Economics, Senior Researcher Angel Ubide.
The state of the US economy has been relatively good, and recovery has brought billions of additional dollars into the balance sheet and has only accelerated a little inflation.
However, the Central Bank cannot ignore a global situation that is not as rose.
It has called on the market to reserve for change, but there are also indications of the opposite.
The decision is to be published on Thursday at 20 a.m. Central European time.
Delta State University shooter left an apology note.
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning – before shooting a colleague later on the same day – Shannon Lamb wrote a message in which he apologized for the first murder and hoped to be able to cancel it, the authorities told me on Tuesday.
Mississip Gautier at Delta State University, Lamb, who taught road and social science, called emergency number about 10 a.m.
Monday, and he told me he shot a man.
Lamb, on an emergency call, asked the police to go home.
"I shot my wife last night," Lamb told me. He also mentioned that there was a friendly dog in the house, which is no harm to anyone but probably scared.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't tell me.
Lamb didn't tell us why to shoot.
The police arrived at the crime scene and found Amy Prentiss, 41, a body and a message written by Lamb's hand, which read: "I'm very sorry and I hope I could cancel what I did.
I loved Amy, and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the message, Lamb drove 500 kilometers away to Delta State University, where he killed Professor Ethan Schmidt of history before he took his own life late Monday when the police reached him.
University Director William LaForge told me that he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but said that Lambia was clearly in trouble with something.
On Monday, it was reported that Lamb presumably believed that Prentiss was in a romantic relationship with Schmidt as well. However, on Tuesday, the authorities announced that there was no information or evidence on the triangle.
For seven years with Prentiss, Shawn O'Steen, who was married, described his former wife as a good person.
The couple had been divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss have a 19-year-old daughter who's shocked.
The man said the daughter and mother were the best friends.
According to Sun Herald, a close friend of Prentiss, Lindsay Knowles, told me that Prentiss was working online from home.
Knowles said that Prentiss had been dating Lamb for three years, and he also told me about a woman's dog named Lightning.
"He always wanted to help others," Knowles said.
According to the police, Lamb had called relatives on Monday and told them that he was not going to go to prison.
When the police reached Lambin Highway 1 near Greenville the same night, Lamb stopped the car, escaped the leg, ran into the woods and took his own life.
According to the University's website, Lamb received a PhD in Delta State University education in spring 2015.
Flavoured stars
The last few years have been heavy for the actor (pictured on the left with his son Redmond).
In 2001 he fought leukaemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor has also struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
Everything that's happened has really demanded its taxes.
Luke Shaw, Manchester United, side by side for months for two fractures.
Luke Shaw's right foot was broken at the Manchester United Masters League's match against PSV Eindhoven.
The defender is troubled to remain aside for at least six months, but Louis van Gaal is still hopeful and believes that Shaw will return to the field this season.
The 20-year-old Shaw was injured in the PSV defense zone in a bad strike at Héctor Moreno when the game was underway for fifteen minutes.
Shaw got first aid on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he could be transferred to the hospital.
"Shaw's got two fractures on his leg, and he's in hospital care," Van Gaal said.
Shaw will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or later tomorrow for surgery.
At the age of 18, the young man who joined Manchester United has experienced hard and is now injured after the wonderful games.
In the suitcase, Shaw was given oxygen.
The man wept.
I'm not a doctor, but when the leg breaks in two sections, he's on the side half a month and he doesn't play anymore at the block stage.
I hope he's still able to play this season.
Moreno had little influence when the situation did not follow a red card of punishment.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal said the Italian courtman made a mistake.
"You can conclude yourself, but I think the situation was worth a penalty kick and a red card.
It was a two-foot unsweet taclaus."
Shaw tweeted like this: "Thank you all for your messages. I can't tell you how broken I am.
More about: Manchester United by Luke Shaw page in PSV match
The defender of England has a special reason to recover in order to compete in the European Championships held in France in June.
"There is a very bad injury," said PSV coach.
"In such situations, all parties are always very sorry.
The goal of players is never to harm the opponent."
Moreno broke his legs when playing in Mexico's rows of the Netherlands created by Van Gaal only in the 2014 World Championships.
"He is very sorry, because his purpose was not to harm the opponent. It is unfortunate to hear that the injury is serious," Cocu said.
"I didn't see the situation.
I only saw the ball that was heading in the other direction, so it seemed that he (Moreno) touched the ball, but I didn't see Luke's tacla."
"I know how it feels. I know how difficult this situation can be," Moreno said to the SBS6 channel.
"It feels really bad. I'm so sorry."
Andrés Guardado of PSV was also taken to the hospital after a clash with Chris Smalling.
David Cameron should know Lorax better.
Before long, every parent will notice that the child learns his favorite book almost out.
Except for seeing David Cameron.
When the children's holidays organization asked Cameron to name his favorite in children's books, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, the one that was published in 1971 by Dr. Seuss's teaching environmental story.
In the text published on the SuperCampo website, Cameron writes that the choice was difficult. "The tarina is fun, touching and creative, and it has a powerful message. I am happy to read it to my children because there is always a picture or message that we have not noticed before."
It sounds good, except that the next point where Cameron is going to describe the book's outline is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to supplement the short initial text.
"The city of Tarville, where the right trees and plants have been lost and even the air is a commercial object, lives a boy named Ted who wants to get his dreams into the heart of the girl Audrey by fulfilling this greatest dream: to see the right tree," the text tells. In 1991, the death of Dr. Seuss, or Theodor Seuss Geisel, Ted had no object of enthusiasm.
If this is not yet sufficiently suspicious, Cameron's text is partially in line with the Lorax film summary on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins as follows: "The city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is commercial goods, lives a boy named Ted, who wants to get his dreams into the heart of Audrey's girl."
Cameron is known as an active parent, so it seems unlikely that the book plot would be so foreign to him. Ahne Kerskane destroys trees and manufactures the needs of them in spite of the name character Lorax's objections. Lorax is a small and thick, fibrous creature that protects the forests.
It is likely that such a minor pr mission of significance is entrusted to an assistant, apparently to a person who has not read Lorax 20 times in a tube as a child.
The Prime Minister's representative reported that the text is probably from the office of Cameron's district.
SuperCamps did not comment more specifically on the matter, but confirmed that the text was the handwriting of Cameron's staff.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of leaving the British team, but it's still hard.
Meeting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but after seeing the last 3-0 series of tests selected by the team on the tour of England, it is not expected to happen again.
I wouldn't even rule out the possibility of a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be more inexperienced than a three-year-old team, but the bat team has good players and the team's attitude is strong – they have no bad experiences from 2012, just youthful positiveness.
As a ballistic player Moeen Ali develops as a spinner, and Adil Rashid, even though he has no Test level experience, represents an attack option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from the English Test Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth away is clearly difficult for me to understand his principal coach in Yorkshire.
His seven Tests have been two good attacks in challenging circumstances, and the simple and cruel truth is that cricket players are criticized according to the results.
For example, Joe Root is not a questionable choice because – as I have said before – players are the best choosers.
A few 50-point matches would have been on Lyth's team, but his fate was in his own hands.
I hope he gets a new chance when he hits Yorkshire more runs.
England's main coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude also when he did not manage as well as he could have, which is not surprising to me. He is above all a team player.
The question of how long the Tests will be given the opportunity to make their impressions is difficult.
Lyth got seven plays – as his predecessor Sam Robson – while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton was given the opportunity in both home and guest meetings.
The only issue of mourning may be that England used Jonathan Trot first in the Caribbean — when Lyth was in the top shape — but this missed opportunity is now history.
Alex Hales is coming on the team and he's the hitter I appreciate.
He's a cricket player of the unknown, which we saw in Yorkshire earlier this season when he scored 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this, of course, depends on the composition of the United Arab Group.
The idea has been thrown into the air that Moe will start a strike with Cook, which will allow an extra spinner to go to the game at the same time as four quickers, and I am not against the idea.
I can't see the obstacle that the top feeder could be hitting here, and this left-handed player has already shown himself to be a great cricket player.
Moeen may not have gotten a lot of time in his local team in Worcestershire, but he's been a team's third player, and it's not a big difference.
My former teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 Tests game as the first substitute player before he got started in 2001.
He immediately made three hundred points, and there was no return.
Zafar Ansari is in the team as a vice-leader, and on the basis of what I've seen from him, he has proved to be a very impressive young man.
People can look at his statistical numbers — on average 31 points as a hitter and 35 pitchers — and this may be a search shot, but a lot of riders have not shown themselves ready, and the pickers decided to take a young player.
He learns a lot during this game trip.
Outside the game team, England seems to have made a few smart choices for its training staff.
The appointment of Sri Lankan hitter, Mahela Jayawardenen, as Adviser for Test Games may be a breakthrough.
This is one of the most sweet men of the species who brings with him much experience because he has played against all kinds of circumstances and all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes to the part of the white ball of the game trip and brings both energy and mercy.
I think he has always influenced an appropriate international cricket, whether his role as a player or coach, and, like Mahela, he has useful intelligence.
Sometimes a new voice in the dressing room, even if it says the same as before, can be a cheering syringe.
Colly's teammate in Durham, Ben Stokes, has rested in one day's fights, Root has had a similar opportunity against Australia, and I agree with this decision.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and electors do not set the game schedule.
And it must be borne in mind that, like players, their jobs also depend on the results.
These decisions will never be taken without considering.
Brexit camp can win if the economy is uncomfortable 2017
David Cameron's half-way strategy for renewing Britain's stay in the EU is day by day deeper, even without the pleasant Jeremy "yes or no" Corbyn's choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or TUC to mock Europe hard on Tuesday.
Other countries have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
The European diplomat has recently explained how many crises in the EU — although not all of them are one's own — have bored some of the Member States with a self-government agenda in Britain, which includes concessions of disagreement and damaging changes to the Treaty, which they do not really want.
In Brighton, the TUC annual congress decided that they would not like it in the EU either if it undermines social security.
We could call it the selfie agent of Dave and George.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Federal Republic hang out at summits and bilateral negotiations in the capitals of different countries, take a picture of themselves in front of a famous monument, with or without high-ranking people, return home and tell them that they have acquired allies for reforms.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants the open-looking British inside the EU. "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says and proposes that more and more short-sighted ministers and civil servants in different capitals have come to the point that we don't care if we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the reasoning German Chancellor is an ally, but has been in power for ten years and wants to leave office before it gets ruined, as happened to those who stayed too long: Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France's François Holland faces a re-election or a successor's choice in 2017.
His power is falling, too.
Poland can soon have a nationalist right-wing government, and in Spain, another left-wing government.
It is difficult to imagine them walking to help selfie-brits who could use their energy better to try to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, and they do not want it either because most of them have separatist powers.
Some of these ministers may plan to deliberately throw unsuitable comments in the style of the Scottish National Party in the 2017 United Kingdom referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend proposes.
"The new talks had been held." "Nothing was left in Britain's hands with the re-conciliation."
The Europeans know how the British accounting press catches and how the EU-Sceptical oligarchist press is, just like the 1975 referendum of Tony Benn, which resulted in 2:1 accessions to the EU in 1973.
Perhaps someone will remotely remember Boris Johnson, a spicy euro opportunist, who became known as our "EU direct correspondent for bananas" in Brussels at the beginning of the 1990s.
At least Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They include taxes, hacking phones and seemingly temporary suckers that own most of our good newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought the same way about them, but then he realized that when he's in a cage with a rough gorilla, he's gonna have to hand out bananas as a shock so that gorilla doesn't eat you both for lunch and dinner.
When France and the Netherlands rejected the agreement in the 2005 referendum, Blair was handy enough to get rid of it.
The press never forgave him that either.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me at Westminster on Monday, I told him that he no longer has time to waste on me, and he might be in danger of putting Neil Kinnock's media-boot strategy in place from the '80s.
It may take time, but Corbyn needs to develop a coherent strategy for dating with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marrin, whose BBC sofa he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what we call politely constructive.
He says he wants to keep us in the reformed EU.
Most of Ukip's and Tory's outside people are likely to respond in a positive way.
That's what Hilary "Benn but not Bennite" Benn told on radio and television this week, when his inner patrol boy tried not to admit that it was a bad bet from Corbyn to appoint a coward John McDonnell as shadow minister of finance.
It reminded me of the '70s when his old father had difficulty being on television unloyal to his Labour colleagues without going too far and losing his place in the lower room.
Hilary's difficulties were more interesting.
Benn said he was opposed to staying in the EU under "all circumstances". McDonnel did not say that either to his colleagues and members of the lower room at a private meeting on Monday night.
He wanted Corby to give up any picture of the suction, you have to remember that he even touched me. The messenger is important for the 24/7 period, especially in the discipline of social media, where paranoia and fraud are involved.
There is no need for Cameron to give the EU a free pass in order to see Labour as a self-evident in the referendum, as McDonnell has said.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks so.
McDonnell's and Corbyn's equation on EU membership fits with the insular economy and the anti-capitalism past. Discussions are no longer part of a narrow circle of leftist dissidents to whom the idea of a similarity is a key study in the doctrine kains.
As far as NATO is concerned, it has also been seen that Tom Watson is unspeakable that Corbyn did not campaign for his departure, and foreign diplomats must try to clarify the matter in their own countries.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital? They have doubtful voters. Why should they give concessions to Britain when everything can be in vain?
The United States has already been quite disappointed in the terrible military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even in the time of the Tory government, and I have received a reminder on Monday in connection with the launch of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticised British authorities' opinions on electric cigarettes
According to the researchers, the state-funded institution's claims that the incineration of electric cigarettes is 95 % less harmful than traditional smoking were created at a meeting of 12 participants with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts criticised the evidence presented in the report on electric cigarettes by the Public Health England (PHE) of the Public Health Authority in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) and Lancet Medical Journal.
PHE described its report published last month as a "reversible and comprehensive review of results".
However, several researchers have questioned the certainty of the information and highlighted the links of some experts to the tobacco industry.
Last month, the Lancet Medical Journal concluded that the most important conclusion of the PHE was "a very weak base" on the teeth.
In addition, two researchers in BMJ have wondered whether the claims were based on ‘call or sand'.
London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Professor Martin McKee and Professor Simon Capewell of the University of Liverpool of Clinical Epidemiology have stated: "The basic assumption of public health care is that the principles of action are based on clear evidence of their effectiveness."
According to McKee and Capewell, the general public assumes that PHE's claim that "the current best estimate of electricity cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than traditional cigarettes" should be based on detailed analysis and modelling of research results.
The claim is associated with a 12-person meeting, which was convened in a multi-target assessment (multi-criteria decision analysis, MCDA) to develop a model based on MCDA. The model sought to harmonise the views of the participants on the adverse effects of nicotine products.
According to McKeen and Capewell, supporters of the meeting included, inter alia, EuroSwiss Health, funded by the former independent research of the CEO, according to sources, by British American Tobacco (BAT).
In addition, the Executive Director showed its support for BAT's public health activities in the Sustainable Action Report.
One of the 12 participants in the meeting granted funding from the electronic cigarette manufacturer. However, this participant did not grant funding from Philip Morris International.
There has been no explanation of the selection criteria of the panel's composition, but there are several well-known supporters of electricity cigarettes, some of which grant their participation as a sponsor of the industry.
However, some participants are not familiar with their expertise in the fight against smoking.
The meeting was also attended by PHE's tobacco manager.
According to McKee and Capewell, the Group's research report shows that there is no undeniable evidence of the adverse effects of the products on a large part of the products and the fulfilment of their criteria.
However, links or shortcomings are not mentioned in the PHE report.
According to PHE's report, no evidence has been provided so far that electric cigarettes can promote smoking for children or non-smokers. McKee and Capewell consider the claim to be premature.
According to Professor Kevin Fenton, PHE's leader for health and well-being has responded earlier.
According to Fenton, electric cigarettes are significantly less harmful than traditional smoking.
Each of the people who smoked through life dies because of tobacco addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electric cigarettes are lower than the risks of traditional tobacco; however, the long-term effects need to be studied more closely.
The PHE is obliged to inform citizens of what evidence shows and what it does not demonstrate, in particular in a situation where the relative risks compared to traditional tobacco are unclear.
In the United Kingdom, there are nearly 80 000 deaths involving smoking each year and the cost of smoking is two billion pounds per year for public health care.
Responsible action requires that we present clearly the current evidence that electricity cigarettes are not a risk-free option, but that the harmful effects are a fracture of the harmful effects of traditional tobacco.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says Channel 4 boss
Luke Johnson, chaired by Channel 4, has stated that the BBC should stop sending certain programs, including EastEnders and The Voice. According to Johnson, commercial competitors would give their right hand on hits such as the Albert Square soap series.
According to Johnson, the licence fee should be used only for the execution of programmes that other television stations do not do.
He criticised BBC's presentation of programmes that are likely to be less successful by the public at the same time as the large audiences' programmes, for example on the BBC4 channel.
After BBC's CEO Tony Hall had announced that the company wanted to increase cooperation with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years to get Channel 4 to cooperate with BBC, unsuccessful.
"I do not agree with the idea that BBC buys formats and sends programs that would clearly belong to some competing channel software," Johnson told the Committee on Communications in Parliament's upper room, which clarified the future of BBC.
If the BBC wants to maintain a radio charge, which I think is not necessarily a good idea in the medium to long term, it should at least reduce its supply to programmes that are not produced and purchased by others.
BBC sends The Voice to the best viewing time because it wants the widest possible support in the future.
If any other channel is not concerned with the program, it is clearly ridiculous nonsense.
"I do not understand why regressive taxation should finance programmes that could be financed without subsidies," Johnson said.
The Voice is one of these, EastEnders the other, even though it is own production.
A lot of channels would give you their right hand.
I don't understand how this serves the broadcaster's service offer.
I don't think these would be BBC loss."
Johnson is a serial entrepreneur who was in the lead of Channel 4, 2004–2010. He thinks BBC is a good viewer because the company works with ambitious people and because they believe that it is the best way to guarantee long-term support.
Johnson's comments on BBC's most popular series are similar to that of former Sky boss Tony Ball, who proposed in his MacTaggart lecture in 2003 that BBC sell off series such as EastEnders.
According to Johnson, the programmes for the BBC's niche public are shown on the BBC4 channel, where spectators can't be measured most often, but the programs meet their purpose. "BBC can say when defending with hypocrites its missions, they did not make any special programs that no one saw."
"BBC presents them in times when no one ever sees them."
Johnson said, "I challenge you to look for another one in that sense of an old-fashioned system, that who gets the best benefit.
Of course, everyone thinks that 150 pounds a year is cheap, but people who it is a big sum, especially if you don't see BBC very much."
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5 channels, David Elstein, who also explained his views in the committee on Tuesday, said that BBC should exchange ancient missions for new "information, teaching and entertainment".
According to Elstein, BBC's current offer hardly has teaching programs – on TV 1 per cent and on radio 0.1 per cent. He adds that BBC should learn from Australia and Canada's broadcasting companies and pray for missions in the new belief: "information, illumination and entertainment".
To the question of cooperation, Elstein proposes that BBC should be able to increase broadcasts, for example from events such as the Proms Festival, which was sent in the past year only part of the break-up. "BBC should also join the alliances with commercial channels, so that the entire offer is also available online," he continues.
Brain cells can be controlled by sound cells using sonogenetics
The video shows how the shuttle mat changes its direction when it is targeting ultrasound.
Researchers have raised worms whose nervous system has been genetically modified, so that worms can be controlled by ultrasound.
Small lamps change their direction when they are subjected to ultrasound with a frequency above the human ear area.
Sound waves activated operating nerve cells that have been genetically modified in such a way that they have a transport film that reacts to ultrasound.
Add on: Researchers follow brain activity by light
According to researchers, worms were able to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new sonogenetics (dubbed sonogenetics). The method uses ultrasound to activate brain, heart and muscle cells with an irritation from outside the body.
Dreekanth Chalasani, a Salk Instute researcher in La Jolla in California, told Guardian that the method could some day replace deep-brain stimulation (DBS). DBS treatment is an invasive method for treating Parkinson's symptoms, which stimulates the brain with electroimpulses.
Chalasani noticed that worms are starting to react when they are placed in a liquid with small microscopic bubbles.
Chalasan says the bubbles force ultrasound waves that move into the worms.
Reinforced ultrasound waves affect TRP4 ion channels that are part of worm cell membranes.
According to the article published in Nature Communications, sound waves make these ionic channels open and activate cells to which they are attached.
In order to control the shuttle pitfalls by ultrasound Chalasani modified worms genetically so that I know the nerves that control their movement appeared TRP4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was directed into the modified mats, the microcups reinforced the sound waves and moved to the mats, when a signal was released in the neurolu.
The method resembles a bit of optogenetics, which is a revolutionary tool that allows researchers to activate neurons by means of light.
However, Chalasan says that sonogenetics has certain advantages compared to optogenetics.
The light is directed to the brains under investigation by light fibers. Instead, low frequencies ultrasounds pass the cell easily, so ultrasound can be directed to the brain through the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and viral therapy human neurons can be temporarily exposed to ultrasound glands in a clinical environment in certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
According to the researcher, the method could also be used in muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unlawful torture — at your home door!
Advertising is a disgrace to the British arms trade
Look at Amnesty International's anti-arms show.
Scary killer missiles!
Ankle-breaking leg trucks!
Grapefruit bombs!
Distance flares that cause unbearable pain but leave no traces!
The joyful voice and drawings clearly reveal that this advertisement of the world's largest arms fairs is parody. The video is produced by Amnesty International, and its purpose is to raise the British government's attempt to sell weapons to oppressive governments at the DSEI (Defence Security and Equipment International) ExCel Center in London Docklands.
More on: DSEI exhibitions: authoritarian administrations arrive in London
There are also posters for bus stops and subway cars that require a second look.
"Important announcement: are you moving on the subway from 15 to 18 September?" The announcement reminds us of the announcements of the London subway. There is a picture of the tanker on the other side of the subway.
"In September, a bunch of arms dealers will arrive in Docklands. Customers will be asked for help so that the arms fairs can be stopped."
Three hundred posters have been made by artists who were present at the Banksy Dismaland Museum of Cruel Designs.
The Collective named Special Patrol Group helped to distribute posters around London with a six-pound hacking package, with six-lock keys that, according to the claim, can be accessed to about a third of the world bus stop advertising listings.
Transport for London doesn't make a joke about Vandalism.
One of the ruined ads of the Special Patrol Group.
According to Cruel Designs' curator and lecturer at Essex University, Gavin Grindon, artists have begun to question matters and want to bring their political work to the public to be seen outside the galleries.
Artists have noticed that social influence through art requires that art be brought into the true world, so many move to work with protest movement activists.
Another of the anti-weapon cartels greets public transport users across the subway.
Amnesty's video has been viewed via Facebook more than 100 000 times a day. It has been designed without compensation by the advertising agency VCCP, and both the graphic designer and the teller have also done their job without compensation.
VCCP's artistic leader Matt Lever broke into the absence of the fair and an empty spot in ExCeL's event calendar. He said, "Let's give them a campaign that they're trying to avoid."
They tried to get tired of a more realistic, blurred business video, but bright colors and animation draw attention better."
"They have done a great job and helped us raise up the fairs that practice illegal trafficking in torture," says Amnestyn Tom Davies.
"The government must now take action and ensure that the means of torture are not illegally traded at our home door."
However, perhaps the most creative anti-management of the stations is displayed in ExCeL's exhibition rooms, where the exhibitors are exploiting splendid circular expressions of their commercial goods.
In the press release, Saab announced the order made by the U.S. Army concerning "the appellant AT4CS RS."
The product includes "a specially shaped warhead that effectively penetrates directly into the target."
It doesn't sound very pleasant.
Eight golden rules for students living in student apartments
I moved to the student apartment 11 years ago, and I was innocent 19 years old, and I still believed in barettes and moral relativism, and only now do I remember the violent smiles that I irritated, and the countless, long complaints of others.
The most important lessons I can summarise in eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment is the most stressful experience and the worst of it is shocking.
In the situation, you can easily tell everyone where you are, did you like the middle year and why, what you like about Corbyn and why you don't "always hate or love Marmita, because it's just an extract of juicy, hahhaha, I'm in my room."
Sometimes take a breath.
And help others to breathe: show your interest and ask other questions.
Questioning guides the conversation and helps you find people you like and people you wouldn't even talk to when your ribs were in the eyelids and these people shared the extinguishers.
Give the rest of us room.
My rooms are often used as drinks, movie theatres and general living rooms, but your own room is also a place to wear, from underwear.
More about: Don't even think you're combining dating and university studies
Introverts University is a hard place
Your own room should be a place of relaxation, but in many houses there is a social culture that walks from room to room and creates lifelong friendships.
Such a culture can be a nightmare for a person who needs a place of return.
In this environment, it is not possible to say, "I like you and want our friendship to continue, but I want you to leave so that I can reload the energy I used by dating you."
Try to find out if any of your fellow students are tired of social interaction. Maybe you should not knock on the door and send a text instead.
Speaking of knocking: knocking.
There was a guy in my student apartment who thought the unlocked door meant that he was welcome in.
He saw all kinds of things.
Get some friends by baking.
You start your study properly when baking is in, so if you bake brownies and knock on someone's door, you don't seem like a 50-century, a little strange case: "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something small.
Homemade delights are a great way to get new friends.
Your schoolmates have to talk to you, and because of the tasteful surprise, they can keep a positive picture of you.
Of course, this requires reasonable bakery skills.
If you serve unfortunate meal, sugar and fat cooks, others will probably pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Supplying food is also a common breach in student apartments.
Taking another chicken is, of course, stealing, but is it possible that his tea drops a tin from someone else's milk cane?
Always make sure the dairy can is the owner.
You'll probably get permission, even if you borrow milk from the owner of your jar.
I understand very well that it's annoying if someone whistles something at you, but try to manage the situation as adult as possible — unlike my fellow student, who dragged his milk into a detergent to punish the lads.
She's in jail now.
Don't mourn when the others try to sleep or stoop.
Not just because it's polite, but it's also worth remembering that every one who digs a hole...
In my own apartment, a girl asked the resident of the next room to adjust the music to a small amount, because it was three in the morning, and she had a test in the morning.
It's just the neighbor's voice power.
When I was finally quiet in the next room, the girl let the neighbor sleep for two hours. She left for three hours at the test, left the music to clean up in her room and locked the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband happened to move to the same apartment?
And wouldn't it be weird if you first thought that your fellow student would be your future mate, you'd start dating, you'd be divorced and you'd have to see him every day and lose the right to meet her with your friends?
Of course, his heart wants what he wants, but if he's definitely not the only one, try to control his desire.
If you notice at a time of grievousness that someone has forgotten their keys in a room where the door is not locked, the limit of tricking and bullying is more blurred than you could think.
It's a good joke, but it's one of those things that's gonna get better in a moment.
Hiding an object may be a valuable and fun lesson, but no room should be messed up with toothpaste and sampoo.
The door of the other room can be locked and drop the keys into the water glass, which will be placed in the freezer, but do not attach any items to the roof with a zinc for a couple more times.
Racist attack on the accommodation of foreign students in Kite - A house designed as a reception centre was damaged in Salo
On Saturday morning, a racist attack on Kite in North Karelia took place at the foreign students' place.
Unlike the police said earlier, this is not the accommodation of minor asylum seekers, but the sleeping facilities of foreign students who have been longer in Finland, says Professor Heidi Luukkainen of the Evankelis People's College.
The windows and walls of the accommodations in the National Hull were pierced with racist signs, such as hacksters, and a metallic object had been thrown through one of the windows of the accommodation, says the East Finnish police.
According to Luke, in the building under evil authority, 10 people were estimated at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some could be elsewhere," Luke says.
People from 12 different nationalities are housed at the National College.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and newly arrived minor asylum seekers.
All those in a messed-up building have a status.
Some are studying in adult basic schools, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish," Luke tells us.
A status is a permanent residence permit which can be granted for four years at a time to a foreigner who has been in Finland for some time.
The East Finnish police are investigating the attack as a damage and a violation of domestic peace.
According to Luke, students were held on Monday's news conference, which also included the necessary interpretations.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had forty years foreign students, and this is the first time that something like this happens," Luke says.
According to Luke, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
As perpetrators, they were suspected of having at least three men, and they had been on a blond passenger car.
I think this is the headline of the youngest weekend when this topic has now been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that," Luke says.
There has also been a bustling hospital in Salo, which has been designed for reception centers.
The case happened last week.
It was on MTV's website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was painted as a hacker and written in English "You are not welcome".
It's been reported to the police.
Amendment 15.9 at 4.02 p.m. Corrected incorrect information provided by the police on the age and status of people living in the building.
The state will shut down the Y train for the Livestock... the passengers in their instincts, "Aivan idiots."
The Y train from Helsinki to Raaseporin Livestock stops travelling in March.
The news indignated passengers on the Helsinki main railroad station from the beginning of the night of the train.
In particular, the downhill road hits the Siuntians, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident in the municipality.
It's just stupid, because the population is growing all the time and working people need a fast and smooth connection with Helsinki.
This can be nothing but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in HSTV's interview video he'll be coming to the capital by tractor.
Train changes are also taking place elsewhere in Newland.
The H and R trains along the main track will be combined with a new R-line.
Purola station in Lakepää and Nuppulinna Tuusula are out of use.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and VR published information on the routes on which the Ministry purchases trains during the next contract period.
The contract period varies over the year and there are routes to be terminated throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement to be concluded in autumn will later be adopted by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
The Siuntian Bengtström considers that the State train operator is a short-sighted operation.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made earlier and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then the repentance comes on.
The Y train also uses other than the Rasseporians and Siuntians, because it is fast and passes by several stations.
On the train, the Espooian Annina Pöyryä was troubled by the fate of those who traveled beyond the city area.
"It's just bad for those who have to plan their journey again," he said in pain to the Y train.
A little relief is under promise.
There must be a new train connection to the coastline, which replaces the Y-train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) area, which leads to the Churchnumme.
This will increase costs for HSL, i.e. in practice for local municipalities and their taxpayers.
"We are now beginning to explore different options and their impact on the level of service and ticket prices," said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs in detail.
Rihtniemi says that, based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid for the Y train for about a million years, of course much more.
The R-line on the main track leaves two seats out.
Instead, the number of train shifts in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes are stopped from the whole country.
The Ministry no longer buys train traffic from the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensuu route will be shortened to the Pieksämäki-Varkaus route.
Train shifts decrease on routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
Over half a million trips per year are carried out on interruptible shifts, with around nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The new agreement is intended to bring 12.3 million annual savings to the state.
The value of the agreement is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter on Capital's timing book: "Marx should be acquainted with"
World economic crises have raised Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his final work, published in 1867-1894, Capital, writes as former president of the SKP, known as Yrjö Hakanen, in the current book Marx's Capital.
"He is now taken more seriously than for a long time," Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and penetration in all sectors of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved surprisingly far-reaching.
The book writer's list, based on the Hakasen seminars, is also a professor of the University of Aalto, a prestigious economic participant in Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's timing "old and forever".
But isn't the former director of the Industrial Research Institute and the Delegation of the Industrial Industry Marx?
Not at all.
On the phone, Korkman tells us that he does not consider Marx as a current economic thinker, but rather an interesting social theorist.
Nowadays social sciences have been differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political aggravator and author of literature.
"The ordinary concept is that the atheist history tells about the wrong opinions of dead men," Corkman begins.
It's true that Marx's prophecies went badly.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions too far from the beginning of capitalism, Korkman wonders.
But Korkman sees the value of Marx's radical installation.
"The most relevant thing in Marx is that he asked good questions," he says.
Now again we are discussing the interests of Marx, as well as the division of wealth.
"Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a changing world as a result of technical revolution," Korkman analyzes.
But what the government should decide tomorrow will not help Marx.
He thinks capitalism was an undesirable case that should just stop.
Still, he thinks he should be acquainted with Marx.
"In the '70s Marx couldn't read," says Korkman.
"Matians and Trotskyians and other sects hated all capitalism, but even more one another."
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weighting of the past few years.
"Every social scientist should be acquainted with Marx's world of thought - as other classics," says Korkman.
UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The United Nations calls for the establishment of a Special Court to investigate the war crimes committed in Sri Lanka in the Civil War, reports AFP News Office.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report accuses both the Sri Lankan armed forces and the rebels known as tamilitikes.
The Sri Lankan Civil War is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
There's no exact information about the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack on the armed forces in the last months of the long war in 2009 should be properly investigated, as required in the UN report.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report blames for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, the victims of which were as likely as men as women.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forcing laterals and children to fight.
According to the report, both parties have committed murders.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to conduct the investigation itself, but will not allow the establishment of a UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
The Yo-English experiment received social media stitching.
On Wednesday's autumn high school booklets had a long foreign language, most of which had English.
More than 16,000 experiments tested their English skills.
In the experiment, he could have written the material on social media.
On the basis of our own experiences, we had to consider whether social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, the article of the 150-250 words in English could show the online magazine to the publisher.
The title was Dear Agony Aunts.
Agony Aunts are in charge of the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He had to ask for advice as to how parents would be able to look at things for young people as well.
There were four subjects of the total substance, one of which was to be selected.
"It was the hardest of them," evaluates the third subject of Porvoo's Swedish-language high school in English Lecturer Mia Lybeck.
On the third subject, there was only a siteau from the former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth theme, Lybeck said, was really nice.
It was supposed to write a fire talk about why companies should hire young people to work.
"At least our school has practiced writing speeches," Lybeck says and evaluates the entire experiment "unnormal."
In Finland or Sweden, the English experiment was able to answer questions about texts, such as the adaptation of summer kampel to climate change and the handling of large masses of information.
A certain lengthy Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
The articles of the autumn will continue on Friday, when there will be another domestic or Swedish or Finnish experiment.
In high schools, the test is normally conducted, that is, the wage earners' mental expression does not affect it.
The College of Students invites the experts to search for appropriate travel connections in time to get to the test.
Even more time can be gained if it can be shown that the lateness was not due to self - carelessness.
In Oulu, they robbed the store with gun threats.
On Wednesday morning, Oulu was robbed of a shop in the district of Kello.
The police said the robber was dressed in dark clothes and his face was covered in a comandopipo.
He's a normal body and about 30 years old.
According to the police, a man had threatened personnel with a handgun and received a small sum of money.
This is being investigated as a rude robbery.
Police reserve tens of thousands of demonstrators to arrive in Helsinki - support teams from elsewhere in Finland
The government's opposing mental expression will block the Helsinki center on Friday, predicting the police.
According to preliminary information, even tens of thousands of people can arrive at the site.
Members of the SADC, Akava and STTK associations will meet at Railway at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the manifestation.
The task of the police at work is not only to carry out alerts and other police activities, but also to ensure the smoothness of gigantic expression.
The roads leading to the railroad are closed from motor vehicles for about 9.30-14 hours.
Only alarm vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off from the road circle of Kaisaniem, from the direction of the west from Mannerheim.
Is there enough people at the Helsinki Police Department, Captain Seppo Kujala?
So far, at least, it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on the work of the police.
According to Kujala, Helsinki is coming to support parties from other parts of Finland because of the manifestation.
The police won't tell us any exact numbers of patrols.
"Something is coming, but in general we will manage on our own," Kujala says.
The police are asking to avoid private caring in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic link extends from Hakaniemi level to its nuclear centre.
Striking traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the night.
With protesters from other parts of Finland, many buses are also coming to Helsinki.
They're not allowed to the Railway.
The buses will be left a long way away, in principle.
Then you have to walk to the demonstration site," Kujala says.
Mental expression also stops Helsinki's mass transport.
From the point of view of the police, there's a positive side of this.
The issue of the smoothness of transport, which is normally at the hands of these large gatherings of people, will now be dealt with partly by itself.
The organizers of the mood have informed the police that Helsinki may become tens of thousands of government economic policy opponents.
The police are waiting for the manifestation to go smoothly.
People are either ordinary or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, Finns are reasonable and peaceful people," Kujala says.
There are also local expressions of mind throughout Finland on Friday.
Friday's expression of mind is, in many ways, exceptional. Do you remember these strikes and expressions of mind?
The great expression of the trade unions organized on Friday is in many ways interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is not a very good comparison in Finnish political history, says professor of sociology at Jyväskylä University emeritus Martti Siisetinen.
It's no wonder that the Ay movement protested.
If it didn't, it would raise the hands up in front of the government, Siisinen says.
A very right-wing government has struck the core points of the Finnish corporatism tradition - and also points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's hardholdings are not covered by contract law.
Here are a lot of features that the ay movement is actually trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the Ay movement also has a place to look in the mirror.
For example, the mirror is needed because the Ay movement does not have any support from all employees for Friday's manifestations of mind.
The new is now the strong division that the expression of mind will bring about among the ay movement that would want to participate in the demonstration.
Unemployed people from various parts of Finland showed their minds at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If Friday's manifestation seeks a benchmark, it could be a gigantic demonstration of the unemployed, Murrostortai, held in 1993, says Siisinen.
In the middle of the deepest depression, Murrostortai gathered 20 000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (kesk) government stumbled from a labour market crisis to another.
It was said that the Finnish government and employees' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho bourgeois administration.
Now the government and the Ay movement may be even worse than the time of the Murrostorte.
Besides, there is now a very bourgeois government in Finland, Siisiinen says.
The current government coalition is still in such an interesting way that it is so tightly right-wing despite fundamental Finnish talks.
There were still certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the breakthrough.
A number of thousands of demonstrators are expected on Friday.
Mental expression also stops public transport and possibly closes up day homes and schools.
Although the expression does not receive undivided support from employees, it can become the greatest for years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held annually in Helsinki in recent years.
They're on the fence.
Traditionally, Finnish Ay movement demonstrations have been quite peaceful - even though the practices have been tightened in recent years.
Traditionally, the Finnish demonstration avoids conflict, is lawful.
Protesters are trying to avoid damage or destruction of property, says Sinisan.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The culture of demonstration changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police were prepared to get swine trash on them.
The strike of firemen took three months in 1998.
Exhibitions were also carried out by, among others, pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical stalls of the 1970s
The most important strikes in the 1970s were the metal strike in 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike in 1977.
70,000 metal men were involved in the metal strike.
The strike was interrupted on the motion of the Conciliation Board after seven weeks of the strike.
Metal men got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, the power strike lasted 49 days and caused power breaks around the country.
Murrostortai in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20 000 people, many of whom were unemployed, met in the House of Representatives to express their opinions on behalf of the work.
Firemen strike three months in 1998
The firemen's strike was one of the longest in the 1990s unless the largest national strike.
Farmers opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police were caught on chicken eggs when farmers protested against the EU in 1994.
"Siberia teaches, the EU stops," was one of the slogans.
For Espa, farmers sprinkled tons of snow.
The EU summit in Helsinki in 1999 also led farmers to protest and burn the playgrounds in front of the meeting.
Nurses strike in 1983 and 1995
Nurses striked for about a month in 1995.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
A few deaths occurred during the strike during the 1995 strike.
Tehy threatened with strike and the mass redundancies of nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass disengagement eventually prompted negotiations to a conclusion.
Doctors strike in 2001
"Medicals in strike - forcing," was part of the strike of doctors in 2001.
The strike of municipal health centers and hospital doctors lasted five months and led to a lively debate on how strikes could jeopardise patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised medical pay.
Students moving in 2013
Approximately 5,000 students marched for student support in Helsinki from Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police will find out that the refugees have been filled with a Finnish truck to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to investigate the situation of the refugee truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped a truck near the German border in Aisterheim, with 42 refugees on board.
There is no information as to whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good shape.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
Investigation and the main responsibility lies at the scene of events in Austria, reports Chief Inspector Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, others in Austria who travelled by a truck were more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died by drowning.
According to the general radio first reported by the Austrian police on cooperation, the truck belongs to the Finnish company.
The company operates, among other things, in restaurants and its CEO is a foreign-faithed, approximately 40-year-old man.
In Austria, two Iraqi men have been arrested for the transport of human smuggling.
A fugitive captain, an ex-drug driver and a stunning businessman, a story of five smugglers.
Upper king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a good-looking taxi driver.
For example, such people are engaged in human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of Trenton University and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and these "clients", and their book Death Travel Office will appear in Finland this week.
In the book they present the smugglers of human smuggling, propose solutions and introduce smugglers from the various stairs of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'll beat them out of my mind right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the east coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many Tunisians are heading there for summer entertainment.
For its location, the islands are also excellently suited for smuggling, since the trip to the island of Lampedusa, which belongs to Italy, is only 120 km away.
For comparison: the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives, the captain who burns in the chain and the father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fisherman is more profitable to transport people.
That is what Emir has done with blue, ten - meter wooden trees for hundreds of times.
If the boat falls full, it'll fit 40 people.
One trip Emir earns around 8 000 euros after the costs.
Emir has five assistants looking for him for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers arrive from many countries, but during the Arab period, a huge number of Tunisians wanted to escape from restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis struck again.
Customers arrive from the continent to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will lodge them in empty houses for as long as you can see.
Food is given so that customers just and just stay alive.
Accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer is running out of money, that's their problem.
They're going to go to the water at midnight with the lights shut down.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then we stop, wait for the day, and the next night we drive to Lampedusa.
Sometimes it's hard to sail, and in 20 meters high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At destination, the cargo has been landed in half an hour and Emir leaves for a return trip.
Emir wants to be scared.
That's why he's stabbing his clients and at least claiming to beat the procurers dead.
He says in the book that when the police once squeezed him, he threw all his passengers over the border and ordered them to swim to the nearest island.
"I took customers one by one from the neck and threw them over the coast," Emir says in the book.
The most peaceful passengers come from the south of Sahara.
They say he's gonna have to abuse this.
I'm gonna beat them out of their minds right now.
We have to show them immediately who's in charge here.
Usual taxi driver.
Goran is an ordinary taxi driver in Bogovað in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good... the starter is pulling his last, and anyway, he's seen his best days.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving over and moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða has a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers to lunch from Belgrade.
A centre for asylum seekers is located next to the village where families are mainly allowed.
In the forests surrounding the centre without their families, the men are housed in tents, plates and abandoned cars, which has now been found or constructed by anyone.
Families living in the forest who have not submitted an application for asylum for a reason or another to Serbia are also living in the forest.
Some also stay in private apartments, but it's a public secret.
Among the hunters, Goran will find most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - through the Balkans the route requires a large number of crossings of borders and weekly walks in a hard - traveling land, often in mountainous areas and in the dark.
At the end of arriving in the Bogovaða region, at the great juncture of human smuggling, people are tired of death.
Goran's riders are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanians, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he tells you in the book.
"They say their things once and that's enough," says Gora.
He says the Africans are trying to tink.
Goran doesn't like it.
You fool, you fool, you fool all the way.
First, we agree to a price of EUR 300, then they count it to EUR 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran stresses that he is a nice and kind-hearted man.
I don't care about money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people," he says in the book.
Goran says he's working cheaper than anyone else and he's just gonna charge 50 euros per person from the Hungarian border.
It's a trip of three hundred miles, most of which are comfortable in the motorway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Goran deserves about 50,000 euros a year.
It is not a large sum for the smuggler, but in Serbia it is a very nice year's income.
Serbia has ordered that taxis do not transport migrants 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care about it: he knows the roads and the short paths and takes his riders a mile away from the border.
Then he'll show his customers the right direction and humiliate away.
In the Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda in Kampala, where there are many believers who escape from Congo, and a small center to help Congolese children refugees.
In addition to preaching, the Missionary runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing the work of kindness.
It's important for the missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoes many times a day and takes care that the rubber strip of white underneath the low waist of jeans will look elegantly.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedeks, his landing car and three motorcycles.
When the missionary does not preach, he organizes people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
The client will start by calling from a five telephone numbers of the Envoy.
He advises that you should arrive at the border in the morning, hide the money with a whistle and dive into the cross-border merchants.
In order to obtain the status of asylum seekers or refugees to the Ugandan authorities, it must be told that they are from the northern Kivu war areas, for example, and that they have been forced to flee the violence in their home.
Often it's true, but if it isn't, the Envoy will arrange a new identity for the client.
An old identity certificate is discarded and another is purchased.
It helps the missionary's contacts with the Ugandan police.
Then the client will be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: to the asylum seekers process, to NGOs, eventually to the UN Refugee Organization in UNHCR.
The missionary knows bureaucracy because he has also become a refugee to Uganda.
He bills for each staircase separately: the submission of an application to the Ugandan police costs about EUR 100, the handling of documents to the humanitarian organization about 150 and the migration process, for example, to a European country EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and ice fires
Tom is a starting smuggler, a former drug driver.
An Irish 40-year-old travels on the French coast of Calais, where his job is to load people into trucks on his way to Britain.
He is assisted by an Afghan, French taxi driver and dozens of truck drivers who don't even necessarily know they're in a human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the taxi driver picked up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving A26 and trying to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would have to go straight to prison for organizing illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom runs with his customers across the motorway to the resting place where the drivers sleep before they go through the channel to the British.
Tom picks up the right truck. Make sure he's on his way to England, and he doesn't even go to Holland, and he cuts off the protective hood.
It's gotta be done quietly so you don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver's on the run, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom will roll his client into a aluminium folio, similar to the one in the kitchen that is wrapped around the fryer or oven potato.
It should stop the police's heat scanner from detecting the hiding place.
Some use a sleeping bag filled with ice for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in a truck and leaves the place hoping that he didn't drive sluggish travellers at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the world's most famous smugglers.
The Turkish outcast has been called the champion of marketing and the undisputed king of the illegal uprisings of the Mediterranean, dominating maritime routes from Turkey to the EU, mainly to Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been active since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage for other entrepreneurs: he only requires the money to be there.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship deception: Turkish harbors are rented to take US or European families to tourist cruises for a few days.
In fact, ships are being loaded to a full extent by Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are being transported against payments of EUR 5 000-7 000 from Istanbul to a port and from there to Europe.
Customers are kept in human stocks, for example in old industrial hats, until these are time to leave.
People are merged into minibuses and driven somewhere to the coast.
They're told to hide among the vegetation and wait for a sign.
When it is given, we need to get onto the ship quickly.
Passengers must stay hidden all the way under the deck.
The marine guard can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the fewer passengers get out and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives about EUR 53 000 for one luxury boat trip after the costs.
He does not deal with practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, householders and other smaller players to work for himself.
During the summer season, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is thought to have purchased land through cover companies, a pharmaceutical company, and more than a hundred apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as the Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
After that, he's probably gone.
Corrigendum 16.9.2015 at 15.10 p.m.: The Death Travel Office book appears here, not next week.
American Olympic Riders Tells About Their Disease and Become Prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 1,500 - meter racer, has attracted attention in the United States.
In a book called Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton tells us about the end of his career and his career as a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published fragments of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career for the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the races in the top shape and ran in the carnivals for the second best time.
But in the finals, he panicked.
At the very beginning, he rushed into the tip and defended his lead on a earthly run.
However, 150 meters before the paint, his strength was exhausted.
He collapsed on the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot, and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself over the goal line, Favor Hamilton tells me in his book.
Later it was revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from a bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had done a year before Sydney's races of suicide, and he himself felt enormous success pressures.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no economic problems, but he was fascinated by the idea of getting money for sex with foreign men.
He also spoke of his husband's acceptance of his actions.
The favor Hamilton tax was EUR 450 per hour.
He says he used the money for luxury life.
One explanation of Favor Hamilton's prostitute was also that he needed the same adrenaline spikes as he had had in his competition in general sports.
Later, favor Hamilton found out that he had a bipolar disorder.
The double life of the former star runner came out at the end of 2012 when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article on him.
Favor-Hamilton participated in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters in the world's statistical code 3,57.40, but remained at the Sydney Olympic Final.
The World Champion rejoiced when the alliance put the Norwegian skiing flower on the hill: "From the bottom."
Norway's skiing king Petter Northug has crossed the limits of suitability in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian Skiing Federation have set aside all summer and autumn, like last year's sports agreement.
Although the union has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has also not applied to the multiplicity of world champions and Olympic winners.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian skiing union decided to shut Northug out of the future season's world cup.
The decision was given thanks by the double world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad that the union had put the skiing flower under control.
"Thank you for showing your back," Jacobsen wrote in his Facebook profile.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for the sponsor of the union," he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian skiing union and Northug is about money.
Looks like Northug would like to be part of the six-year country team so he could advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said that he was happy to represent a covenant that will also care for future generations, and that he will not let one of the athletes alone.
At the same time, he recalled that the union has given Northug both economic and other privileges for several years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb does not accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because it is the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own press release in which he assured that he would want to have brave Norwegian colors in the next season in the worldcup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won six MMs in his career, of which two golds.
He was in Falun last winter on a winning team of messaging gold.
The turtle day of the fryers is also held in the North
On the day of the 25th of September, tricks will be held in different restaurants and shops that have been granted the Turtle Translators.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food skills and to decay the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the kil as part of high quality.
At the same time, we would like to remind you that not all high-level restaurants have been concentrated on the capital region, but that top restaurants that have been audited and classified by an impartial operator are available throughout Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the significance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the kilpiratory and the organization.
A restaurant in Vaasa in Fondis and Kantarellis is organized in the north of the country.
In Kokkola there is an old town restaurant for the turtle day.
The event has also received significant attention at international level.
The event has therefore been decided to make the organization one of the most important international events that will take place during the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland continues to remain host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: A complaint against the Chancellor of Justice concerning the establishment of a reception centre in Kauhava
The Immigration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are cooperating in the establishment of a reception centre for refugees currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy in Kauhava's former shipownership.
According to the complaint, the critical infrastructure in the period of crisis, which is used by the defence forces and its partner, namely Finland's Erillisnets Oy, remains permanently in the region.
The Kauhahajoki magazine states that, according to a private person, the establishment of a reception centre in the same building would constitute a significant safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area and airport of the former Flying School, which have no effect on the preparation of the reception centre as well, the newspaper will write.
The case states that in the area of Kauhava, negotiations have been held over the last two years on the organisation of flight training and the entry of a potential foreign operator to the airport.
The matter has been discussed, inter alia, with the Minister of Defence, Jussi Soisto (P.) and the Head of the Ministry of Defence, Arto Rädy.
The individual submits to the Chancellor that the complaint is not about the fundamental opposition of the reception centre, but about the fact that the planned place in the former armament area is wrong.
The City Hall of Kauhava dealt with the reception centre last Monday.
Siege: Syria's situation reflects Ukraine and the Baltic Sea
The government means that the immigrants and the people here have the necessary conditions, Soisimus commented to the journalists at night after meeting the presidents of all the parliamentary parties in his office in Mäntyniem.
According to the President, concern about the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He appreciates the fact that in Finland, government and opposition parties are able to discuss the underlying issues confidentially.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the solitude, the situation in Syria and the activities of Russia and the United States in the region may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea.
The sociation is a hopeful development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive direction, i.e. the United States and Russia are capable, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and will continue to affect the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the sorcery, the issue of NATO was also ignored in discussions.
The President did not take a position on the situation in the labour market.

Early education agency promises to report further changes to activities tomorrow.
Media researcher: Sipilä takes a big risk
According to Sipilä, communication requires a variety of channels, and the Prime Minister's television and radio talks are one channel among others.
Such a channel of direct speech will also be needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told the journalists in the parliament.
Sipilä did not yet want to assess how often the Prime Minister's television and radio talks will be repeated.
According to Sipilä, speeches will not always be transmitted in the future by the Yle channels.
If other channels are registered as a channel, then we'll see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipilä said.
According to Sipilä, the state of Finland's economy is to the extent that it requires television and radio talk for citizens.
This set of issues, which are now being discussed, is rather complex and requires longer arguments.
That's why we ended up in this channel, Sipilä figured it out.
The address will be sent at 21.05-21.20 at both TV1 and Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Sipilä takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes that Sipilä's TV talk won't tell us about the more general government's inward turn.
Is it an attempt to tighten the right to define public debate in its own hands and to refuse public debate on the settings for questions?
It reminds me of Soin's silent comment that he does not follow the media agenda or let it define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these issues will not be interrelated.
Kovunen understands that commercial media has been indignated by Sipilä's announcement.
It would be weird if the media field didn't react.
The types of communication of political decision-makers are not a matter of communication in democracy.
The role of media representatives is defined to ensure that agendos of politicians are not adopted.
He says TV talk is a big risk for Sipila.
In speaking, Sipilä should bring something new and special to the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there any more available today than we've already heard?
Or is he able to speak differently, differently or differently, or to say something new?
Kovunen says that if there is only more of the same old in the promise, you must wonder why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it exceptional time.
Usually take this risk in that sense if this is not a special situation, but a routine talk among others.
The danger is that Yle will be labelled as a message by politicians or by the delegation and by the government, which is certainly not in the interest of Yle or in the general line.
Stick's a smart bet
In the future speech of Sipilä, it is also important that what the Prime Minister fails to say, the media researcher stresses.
At night you should look closely at what Sipilä is missing and what is not, says Jyväskylä University Research Coordinator Heikki Kuutti.
Kuutin says the TV talk is a clever bet from Sipili, because this is how this will bring out its own view without sounding.
This will provide a large audience without a journalist's filter, unlike a news event where journalists can ask critical questions.
Sipilä passes through the media and speaks directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media interprets something wrong about the speech, because specific questions are not allowed to be raised.
The moon says it's very important how Sipilä shows up on TV... the coin sweats, if the hands are shaking.
He compares Sipilä to the father character who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipilä can do well, it can work.
The situation is different than that if the government were to inform one thing, because in this case a person speaks directly to another person.
Obama and the partners regularly engage in such (President Barack of the United States).
Really Exceptional
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He says that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister speaks directly to the people.
An exceptional time requires exceptional means, Railo says.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister wants to make the Finns sympathetic to the blackmails ahead.
On Friday, employees' organisations will organize demonstrations and strikes against government actions.
The president of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, on Twitter, says that Sipilä could hold his speech on the status of the nation in the delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed.
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces his challenge to Sipilä's dialogue.
There's no time for monologues.
Soon, half a year from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old son on the run has been found in Tampere.
The boy was fine at the time of his discovery.
The boy's been found and in the world, the boy's father updated his Facebook page.
It's also confirmed by the Finnish Police Department for the evening.
The boy went out to play out at four o'clock this afternoon.
Later tonight, he was no longer contacted.
My father thanks all those people who helped in the search.
Thank you for the tens of contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was distributed more closely than 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time
The Finnish UFC star disappointed in the violent savage of young people:
The Kurdish freelance artist Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook, which particularly appeals to immigration backgrounds for young people.
Makwan Amirkhani held a pressing speech against young people's reluctances.
At the age of five, Amirkhani, born in Iran with his family in Finland, has so far won both his professional game in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani says he received a message asking to see a Instagram account.
Videos have been downloaded to the account where young people fight with extremely violent grips.
Amirkhani tells me that he is disappointed in the savageness of young people.
Amirkhan, 26, has over 62,000 successors on Facebook.
Guys kick on the ground, sit on the other one and slap without thinking about any of these consequences when you make these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend
Some of the young people visible in the videos are immigrant backgrounds.
According to Commissioner Jarmo Heinose of the Helsing Police, the social media has loaded both immigrants and Finnish youth.
It's the fact that you guys are fighting all over the street.
You make life of so many other immigrants more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani reminds us that there are sites in Finland that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become extremely gruesome.
A little hard, boys, to defend you again.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be here for a long time.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani invites young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever get subjected to racism, you'll blame yourself for it.
Think about it a couple of times before you go along with that kind of thing, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action contributes to racism.
You're gonna make me hate something that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and you're not going to make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
The SGF will hold its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions on Monday
On Twitter, Germany's President Lauri Lyly reports that the Employee Organisation will consider its position on the alternative savings list presented by STTK on Monday.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
STTK said earlier on Wednesday that it would present to the government its own proposal to achieve the 5 % productivity factor required by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre).
Mr Akava's president, Mr Fjäder, believes that the government will accept the proposal if the SK, STTK and Akava are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require that the largest employee organisation in Germany soften its earlier position.
The German President, Lauri Lyly, commented on this briefly on Twitter.
Mr Lyly writes that the Bureau of the SGF will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lyly, the SAK is seeking solutions to open the labour market block, and it is necessary instead of forced laws to conclude agreements between the active parties.
Mr Lyly reminds us that the proposed social agreement proposed by the Government of Prime Minister Sipilä for the SME did not apply.
Sipilä had previously cut out the negotiations on the social agreement when the SME did not agree to commit itself to the target of 5% of productivity.
Comment: The great protest threatens to blow "I feel like a little funny tree fist"
I wonder if it feels a little funny to pull a fist, if there's already a reconstituting paper in the pocket, it's Pekka Tiinanen.
The sensations vary in the employee camp from one side to another.
Is it meant to call the government to revoke or then agree with it?
On Monday, the German Federal Leaders bled holy hatred against the government of the Republic.
All of Finland was threatened to get caught.
The threat spread to the Acavalans.
The OAJ trade union of teachers threatened to close schools and day-care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ cancelled: no school or day home will be completely closed.
On Wednesday, Mr Antti Palola (sd), President of the STTK Association of the Centre of Staff, appeared as a conciliation.
He said that he had kept in touch with the government and had drawn up an alternative proposal called for by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (centre) as a five-percent productivity factor.
Sture Fjäder (cok) of the Akava President immediately rushed to announce that his agreement paper is already ready.
At first, there was no yard in the office of the S.A.I.A.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to agree with when the federal leaders just Monday ordered the country to stand on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SME Bureau will meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SME will seek solutions to open the labour market block.
In order to create a common proposal for employees, the SME should tend to accept a 5 % profitability factor as an objective.
No wonder the STTK of Palola has a good relationship with Sipilä's government.
The right hand of the fire, Mr Jukka Ihanus, head of the STTK's social impact, previously served as special assistant to the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhase and Mari Kivinieme.
So the ballole described that the government's ay-knowledge has been improving all the time.
Random or not, but the Palola exit took a little clean out of Finland's standers, whose boom picture is the ACP Marko Piirainen (sd).
I wonder if it feels a little funny to pull a fist if there's already a reconstituting paper in the pocket.
Modified at 6 p.m.: Additional information on Lyly's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: "This must not happen again"
President Sergei Naryshkin of the Russian Duma criticized the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
The Russian Duma President, Sergei Naryshkin, believes Mongolia is a better host than Finland.
In the capital of Mongolia, Ulan Bator has begun a symposium of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly, where Naryshk made extensive comments on the July Helsinki celebration.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians from the European Union, such as Naryshkin, at the meeting - a matter on which the President resembled journalists.
According to our assessment, this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed the news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States where his access had also been prevented.
Sanctions are a political suicide from the EU, Naryshkin declared.
In Mongolia, the Russian delegation became complex, so Naryshk continued his scoring of Finland by commending and thanking Mongolia for "excessive organisation".
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and positively - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that Parliamentary dialogue should not have obstacles.
Naryshkin has met Ilkka Kanerva (cok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed with the Russian delegation at the Ulan Bator meeting.
The lock meets the real playoff player: "The battles are tight"
Tappara and Lukko will continue the bully days in Haka forest today when both of them will be on fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today in the Haka forest, she won't see a real goal party.
Tappara went to the Kuopio yesterday to dig up a 3-2-time win from KalPasta.
The rise was manly, because the silver group in the last season was the worst of the loss of two goals.
The lock on Tuesday was more mollifying.
As a guest of Blues, the Raumatians' prey, had round zero points, and loss readings were also 2-3 years old.
Hard game, paints in tight, if any play the same game as last year, Lock-assailant Janne Lahti predicts settings on the club pages.
Tappara has formed a fair playoff nightmare for the Raumatists.
In fact, Tappara has dropped in the two previous periods just from the final series of Luko.
On both sides, a decisive seventh match has been required for the solution.
Last season, the Locker took the series to a break already in the fourth game, but Tappara rose on the next three sides and passed.
There are no major changes in the compositions of the groups, with the exception of goalkeepers.
The cashiers that both rejected yesterday will have a humiliation today.
With the Killara goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Bear, and between the locks, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
View corner: In recent running a terrible play
The sports director, Hopela, handwritten by the chief coach, Rautakallio's inappropriate follow-up, writes from Santtu Silvennoinen Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone handwritten a Rocky film where he himself played the main part.
The contestant sensationally put in campuses a heavy series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky was very sympathetic, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Toivola wrote a restless ashes story to Pori.
Anonymous and wooden patrullery pack went forward to the 2006 SM finals as a surprise.
The team was full of rocky-like unnamed, but hard-to-reachers.
There were white Indians, Porin Matt and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, the players turned their heads red and cut off the irokeees.
The wishhouse became a blonde.
A great TV reporter, JP Jalo, called Coach Neumann.
The asses took the won silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Hopela believes that this season's novelty works in the same way as ten years ago.
A man who works as a sports manager has built a pagan for the evil sons.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have rotted guys in the neck like Rocky pig carcases in the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen's earnings are in some other place than a game.
The hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part of the show is Pekka Rautakallio.
Karri Kivi has crossed the Railbow Sean Connery.
In Rocky, hopela's handwriting of the iron rock is as clumsy as the main performer of Connery's original work in 1976.
There's nothing in the railroad except Rocky's nickname.
I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I mean, I don't know.
He appreciates the hard game, but there's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, Mr Garret Stafford tackled Tapparan Jere Karjalainen's head.
He got the judges 2+10 minutes, but the Railbow put him in a shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play those who deserve.
I don't accept a game like that, and it's not part of the Aceek, and the hot-heated Railbow was blown up after the game to the 100th-year-old nation.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's trains, veterans, cops, mentorers.
There are virtually no key men in the best game age.
No wonder the main coach has complained of a shortage of skills.
How much have you been able to influence player acquisitions, Pekka Rautakallio?
Last year's events have an impact on procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, Iron Kallio responded diplomatically.
It's underneath the surface.
The annual model of 1953 Railways is known to be interested in moving to Hopela as a sports boss.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The balance of the majority in the three leagues of the season is equal to the loss of the 1-6 goal.
I wish you wouldn't have written the next part.
Olga Temonen plays Sipe Santa's mother.
Olga Temonen reveals that if he had met his husband Tuuka when he was a teenager, they wouldn't have had anything in common.
Olga Temonen plays for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yeah, I'm playing my husband's friend's mother in the movie.
It kind of feels crazy, the actor and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
He's been married to Apulan's ex-basist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple have done a lot of work together before, but now Olga plays for the first time under Tuuka's guidance.
Olga's role in the early years of Apulana You made us a beautiful movie with a drummer Sipe Santapukki's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsempa and supports his son, even though this father Risto (who presents Lorenz Backmann) is trying to be a sound of reason.
The more I have known my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to be to play a role.
He's a great guy and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have come a lot closer.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've been communicating.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles through their history.
Luckily, too, I understand that the drama is dramatic and that the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apulasta would become the largest band in Finland.
The '90s, there was a depression and a real duck.
There was quite a small probability that someone actually succeeded, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga tells me that he had heard a lot about Tuu from his youth before the film plans.
However, parents' stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how many parents really know what you were doing.
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from the Tuuka, known as Heinola's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was an ark and a nice girl who had nothing to do with Tuuka.
At the very least, he could have hiddenly enchanted himself.
Olga says he's been working so hard with Tuuka for 10 years that the big joint project is not scared.
Everything's always been super good.
Now the entire production group will go to Heinola for a month.
However, the couple who live in Italy often plans to drive home for their little children, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole Heinola month.
They have taken us very warmly, just asking what regrets and when to be emptied.
Iron Sky 2 rose to Finland's most expensive play film
Iron Sky, led by Timo Mountainsola: The Coming Race, is a budget of EUR 17 million.
The descriptions will begin in October in Belgium.
The director Timo Mountainsola starts filming Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
Scifi movie Iron Sky's follow-up part, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, rises to the most expensive play film in Finland's 17 million euro budget.
Previously, the most precious film in Finland has been titled by Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
After graduation of Iron Sky 2, the Angry Birds animation will also rise, as the film's budget is more than EUR 100 million.
The film produced by Timo Mountainsola and Tero Kaukomaa begins in October near AED Studios and lasts eight weeks.
Director Timo Mountainsola is leaving for Belgium next week.
The giant budget isn't scary.
I've been sick and relaxed!
I have such a relaxed fiilis from the script, because I know exactly what kind of movie should be.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the public, he'll tell the evening magazine.
Initially, the film had been budgeted for 8-10 million, but as the script developed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's a big stoor.
However, 100 million people should be involved in the film, because each image angle and efficiency is so expensive.
Now it's all so tight that there's no loosening.
The film production company Iron Sky Universe launched today on Wednesday a mass financing campaign and a bond that pays 4-8 per cent of the annual interest rate.
The final interest rate is determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
The film includes Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
Junk or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
Trendsetters' breasts have recently decorated big logos.
Some time ago a fashion-conscious dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in the consana.
Advertising the label of a caper or a T-shirt was seen as a junt.
It's time that changes.
Sport has become a real megatrend of fashion, and also old, well-known sports fashion brands such as Adidas and Nike have risen to the coolness wave.
And like so often before, the border between funny and trendy is blurred: if something's already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came a standard core trend, that is, a tavismoot, where trends were surprised by favouring the most boring basic clothing as a means of separating itself from mass.
Now, instead of a grey basic college, it's already buried at the bottom of the closet with a brand-new logo.
The bigger and the more traditional, the better.
In addition to the Logs, for example, Adidas' identifiable trackers, the favorite team's game shirts and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to the street fashion.
The Calvin Klein logos of the alkaline are now a cool detail.
Trendi seems to be moving from sports bars to luxury brands as well.
For example, the breast of Versace's intestines makes it clear what a marked garment is.
Would you be prepared to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published the evidence, "I'm not stuck in the tank's bone for hours!"
According to the allegations, a special incident would have occurred in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo 2015, rapporteur for the Russian military industry, was held.
In recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful allegations that the Russian Ministry of Emergency had to remove the large-scale Zotov tank for five hours.
Since then, Zotov has done everything he can to deny the information.
He even published on his own public Facebook page a picture where he seems to look at the trunk of the armor vehicle in a very good mood and at least on the basis of their pictures it is not about getting stuck or mad.
That's bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go inside a battle tank, but it was a raid tank truck BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Colonel. I've served at Ural.
I went in there, looked around and came out in peace, Zotov told Komosomolskay Pravda.
I wasn't stuck and I didn't really spend five hours in that position, he said.
To the Russian military television channel Zotov explained that he had amazed at the exhibition about Russia's new technology because he was himself a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I was amazed at our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And even in the next exhibition, I'm definitely going to go to all the tanks and all the raid tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called on the reporter who wrote about it to be a fool.
One fool wrote and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside, and I came out.
I'm long and rotten, but nothing that would be stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said to the Russian sluzhba novostei radio.
The words of Zotov support the fact that no photograph of the alleged seizure has been published, even though a total of 50,000 people took place during a few days at the exhibition.
The claim that Zotov was stuck started with a story on the Bloknot.ru website where Zotov was told of his ripping of the tank box while trying and finally threatened to shoot everyone around unless he got out of his surface.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up article in which the organizers of the exhibition reported their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to the fact that soldiers jump quickly out of armored vehicles.
But MP Zotov, because of his large size, simply stayed when he came out.
But in no way did he sit there for five hours, said the coordinator of the exhibition to Alexander Pisarevski Bloknot.
Here's the favorite item for decorative bloggars.
Architects' brothers Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84) Lassen's candle from 1962 looks like it was planned today.
The hot steel frame is like a piece of art, and that's what it originally was.
Architects' brothers are known to have worked out the shape of a candle long and mathematically accurately.
It was presented at first only to the honored dinner guests of the lords.
The Kubus candlesticks are manufactured by the family company By Lassen, which maintains the legacy of the famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Danish Holstebro in eight, four and one candle versions, in four different colors.
It's black, white, nickel and copper.
The candle is right now timely and is suitable for many kinds of homes.
It has recently been especially the favorite object of decorativebloggers.

You're testing someone's endurance.
He's no paper, but you know he's not hard like a rock.
You're the same in a number of things, like life power.
You're wondering how things are going forward.
You have strength and will to make them succeed.
It is also important to be mild toward yourself and others.
But you're not so fast that you could get someone to understand your position about it.
He's slow, and he doesn't even want to be in charge with you.
You're on your feet with someone, because there's one thing going on.
There is no one way to approach it, but at least you know that you have a common goal.
You've taken a measure with someone.
But you're not racing in a traditional sense, but you want to know what kind of a man or woman he really is.
Your assumption hits the right one.
That's why it's good to brag his chest.
You've got a chance today to have something to do with.
Do it even if your time is on a card.
One of them is a person of his own kind.
You'll understand it by the time he opens his mouth.
The gestures and expressions also tell a lot of time before that.
Someone's going to get in front of you.
You can't see that the situation would be amazing, but there is a lot of vague atmosphere in the air.
You know where you're going.
Your experience is right, even though someone wants to show that he's much more aware of things than you.
The need for emphasis is not the only thing that's going on in him.
Your readiness for different tasks has increased over the years.
Someone sees potential in you.
It's a little bit of your self-esteem.
You're gonna be wondering if there's anything to do with it.
You're at the edge of the essentials.
You know a lot about where you move and who you want to spend your time with.
You won't stay in your seat. You want to move forward.
You're stressing a certain kind of thing about yourself so much that someone starts talking to you about it.
The debate is not about to end.
It shows how interesting you are.
There has been a leak in the Kittilän mine of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland.
The purified process water of the gold mine has leaked from the so-called sand pool to the dive.
According to the company, measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
There is neutralised sand of the foaming process and cleaned process water.
Usually, water is pumped for re-use as a process water or carried through the surface valuation field to the environment, according to authorisation.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic metres per hour when it was detected.
According to the company, the quality of the leakage water meets the current conditions of authorisation.
The other ingredients were not poured into the environment.
The leak was observed during the inspection round on Monday morning.
No bleeding has been found to have caused structural damage to the dam structures in the pond.
The company reports that it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred stable workers.
Dansken Kuoppamäki: The IMF warns not to cut too much
The Finnish Country Report published today by the International Monetary Fund is largely in line with the views of the Government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation paved on structural reforms covering Finland to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, the reduction of overtime allowances and paid leave days would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed in the whole contract system and in the area of unemployment security.
According to Danske Bank's main economist Pasi Kuoppamäe, structural reforms are agreed, but there are also small differences.
The IMF's assessment has a lot of sympathetic message for government action, but on the other hand there are also words of warning about what should not be too much cut.
For example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to economics.
In the view of the IMF, growth projects should also be implemented as quickly as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
For this year, the IMF anticipates a 0.4 % economic growth rate for Finland, which will increase to 0.9 % next year.
Today, Danske anticipates that growth will remain on zero this year in its new cyclical forecast.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They could have had the most recent findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in small growth during the summer, says Kuoppamäki.
Less attention could have been paid to the weakened confidence in industry or to other so-called softer measurements.
However, there are only a few per cent of decimals in the gaps.
Nintendo, who recovered from death, appointed a new leader
In July, Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, died of cancer, began his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendoa since 2002 and he was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
For example, Iwata was responsible for the success of the Wii consol.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as potential followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow Iwata's footprints, evaluated by the Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda Reuters.
The task of Kimishima is to see Nintendo being heavily involved in mobile games, but it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
More and more minor asylum seekers arrive in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Agency acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have arrived in the country disappear each year.
According to the Swedish Immigration Agency, there are hundreds of minor applicants on the website of SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, among others.
Overinspector of the Immigration Agency Juha Kannelmaa tells us what is the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How much of the applicants will disappear "under" a year?- A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013.
They're missing nine.
In 2014, 196 similar applications were made and 11, Cannelmaa reports.
The background to the disappearance may be that it is clear that the applicant has already been registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and that he may have been found to be a full age.
In this case, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some of the missing will also be found later when they seek asylum from another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 were taken a demolition decision because the applicant was likely to have moved out of Finland, so adult asylum seekers disappeared over the last 123 years, he says.
Is the amount growing?
By 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from a minor who came alone.
The total number of minors who have disappeared this year is not yet available, but the number of minor applicants is therefore known and has increased clearly, which is likely to affect the number of missing persons as well, he stresses.
What happens to those who have taken the decision to turn?
Are they also missing, for example, in the "dark labour market"?
This is difficult to assess from the Immigration Agency, as the implementation of the translation decisions is the responsibility of the police, the Cannelmaa stresses.
Mr Petteri Orpo (Cok) has been concerned about the growing number of unregistered applicants in the country.
He's taken action on this matter.
On Monday, Orpo, who discussed the issues of refugees at the EU Inter-Ministry Meeting, discussed practical measures to manage the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A.'s studio online - see pictures of equipment
Because of the disease scenes, the equipment used by Timo T.A., who lost his ability to work in the media sector, is now being sold.
Mikkosen's spouse Nina Mikkonen sells equipment on Huuto.net, which in the past were the most advanced tools for professionals.
The online announcement was the first online magazine to tell you about the Nightmakasine.
Today, a large part of the equipment has been left on the foot of technological development.
The digital media world no longer describes television programs for Betacam.
Still, Nina Mikkonen is confident that interested people are found.
Of course, the equipment is no longer that way, but these are also needed as long as there is material from the old generation that needs to be digitalized.
On the other hand, there are also a lot of hobbyists - collectors and studio builders, Nina Mikkonen is thinking about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkoset is trying to move away from his current stormhouse.
There's no way we can take all the goods with us.
I've started to invent and see what stuff they give up.
This is where I started, says Nina Mikkonen.
There's no use for TV or radio devices anymore.
It is clear from the aftermath of the infarctions in the brain that a long career man no longer returns to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen's actual work of life was already archived in the summer of the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives visited to pick up films and other materials from the storm shop.
Transport threatens to lumber worse than expected: Metro and railroads can stop all Friday
Metro and railroad drivers will decide today whether they're expanding force on Friday's manifestation.
The original plan was to stand in metro and rail traffic only for the time of the manifestation of the mind on Friday.
During the afternoon, we'll figure out if the traffic stops for the whole day.
Chief trustman Pekka Hirvonen says the threat is huge on the field.
Night and rotary cuts squeeze the drivers badly, so the government's plans to cut the litters raise resistance.
He wonders, however, that stopping traffic all day is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tramways stand by Friday, public transport is virtually completely stopped in the capital region.
According to VR, trains do not travel between morning and evening on Friday.
Friday, they don't move near or far.
The trains that left before morning will be driven to destination stations.
According to HSL, most of the buses are left on the stall.
The ACP members are out of work from Friday morning to Saturday morning at 3:00 a.m.
Possibly a small number of buses can be driven, driven by the superior force, HSL informant Pirkko Repo thinks.
Repo says HSL can't tell exactly which bus site thugs will be going on Friday.
Employee organisations will organize a major demonstration at the Helsinki Railway on Friday at 11-13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place on the Hungarian-Serbia border, where many refugees are trying to move forward to Europe, reports AP News Office.
Sky News says the refugees have tried to break across the border.
Refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at school in Texas. The teacher thought the own watch was a bomb.
In the United States, in Texas, a 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested since the teacher kept his own watch in school as a bomb.
Mohamed told Dallas Morning News that he only wanted to present his electronics performance.
But one of the teachers kept the clock like a bomb.
The police were invited to attend, and the situation finally ended when the boy was taken in handcuffs to the juvenile's arrest cell.
Mohamed has at any point been found to have claimed nothing but that he had made a watch.
Still, it's still possible for the boy to be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohamed, the police had said the clock looked like a "movie bomb."
The clock is in police custody, but it was known to consist of a circuit record and a digital display between which there were wires.
The case happened last Monday and Mohamedia was punished on three days' forced leave from school.
His father is angry about the case and the American-Islamic Council of the country is wondering whether the case is another sign of Islamophobia in the United States.
UK kohisee - Labour Director refused to sing a national song
The song asks God to protect the queen, but Corbyn is the opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the press in the right has also been accompanied by the representatives of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, thought labour representative Kate Green in BBC's radio interview.
Green thought Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday, the battle of British Air Force pilots against German Luftwaffe was respected in 1940.
In its official opinion, the Labour Party defends Corbyn and stresses that he has shown respect for the pilots by participating in the event.
We are all in a huge debt of gratitude to the heroicity of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood respectfully silent during the national song, stressed in the opinion.
Corbyn's election to be party leader has divided the labour lines.
In particular, there are those who fear that he will expel moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby supports unilateral disarmament, the cessation of savings and the increase of public expenditure.
Today, Corbyn is due for the first time in the capacity of the party leader in Parliament at the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn has asked the public for proposals on what Prime Minister David Cameron should ask.
Cameron spent the week on Twitter, choosing Corbyn as party leader.
The Labour Party threatens our national security, our economic security and the security of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted with his own account.
The reason for Minnesota's family murder is still unclear. The father of the family was waiting for a legal case.
The South Lake Minnetonka police have soon investigated the family murder of Minnesota in Greenwood.
A five - spirit family was found dead in their home on September 10 and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was father Brian Scott Short, 45.
After shooting his wife and three children with a gun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of the house.
Dead for days
The family was found after school was concerned about the absence of children.
On the basis of this report, the police went to the house for an inspection visit and found the family of Short dead across the vast house.
According to StarTribune, it's possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Million houses and a successful company
The investigation into the case of Michael Sitar, Chief of Police of South Lake Minnetonka, is still under way.
The motive for blood tests is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his assets for nurses on the social media website AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at the StarTribune interview, Short reported that there were four million different visitors per week on the site.
I've been making 50 bids for the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
However, I still have a lot of ideas that I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell a company, but not yet.
The success was shown, among other things, by the fact that in 2011 the family of Shorti bought the house in Greenwood for two million dollars.
The house is advertised on the real estate site in Zillow as a car collector's dream: the house has not only 12 rooms, but also an adequate garage for eight cars.
Jurisdiction on the verge
But StarTribune said the father of the family was waiting for a court case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-trial courses, had challenged him for comments on the AllNurses.com website.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Shorti's website had not been removed from the pre-trial courses, and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial had had a significant impact on Short's transactions.
Water Loiri offered cake coffee
In addition, the three owners were rewarded at the food event at the Finnish Hippos Month Horse Owner Prize.
This is great, Loiri commented as a good feeling of honor.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won Derby on the first Saturday of September and earned its winning EUR 100 000.
The artist's legend Loiri was still confused about Fabrice Duo's success in the big competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
Successful Horse Coach Korpi will get Loir in full peace of work with a horse.
Pekka commands and decides where the horse is taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut up, Loiri.
A marvelous gesture from the NHL star: "The greatest gift made by an athlete of all time"
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million (approximately €6.7 million) to Montreal children's hospital.
According to the health report, this is the largest donation made by a sportsman of all ages to charity in Canada.
In addition, the 26-year-old Subban is committed to assisting the hospital in other financial collections for the next seven years.
Subban made a contract with Canadiens a year ago worth eight years and $72 million.
So Subban's donation sum is significantly greater than his $9 million annual earnings.
For the award of his donation, Subban will receive a lobby from the hospital.
The Canadiens players have previously helped significantly local hospitals.
A year ago, the long-lived Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars from the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu collected a huge sum of money for another city's major hospital to receive the necessary PET scanner for cancer studies.
You can order a Japanese coffee for a wife's evening. She serves just bikini and a essay on her.

Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: Car security attacks began to be equipped
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the sector, which Intel publishes.
The board is composed of top security experts from all over the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of cybersecurity best practices.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The International ICT Research and Consulting Company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in the transport sector have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75 % of these vehicles are capable of consuming, creating and distributing network-based data.
We can and we need to improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Intel Security Director Chris Young.
The ASRB enables Intel to establish best safety practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component in the design of each vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, making the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in data processing.
Ford Focus RS pays about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Fordin Focus RS model has been expected for years to rise like a moon.
Finally, the car is also in view of Finland.
Ford published RS information now that the car world looks at the Frankfurt car exhibition.
The Ford's new four-lived RS is accelerating, thanks to its 2.3 litre, 350-powered engine, in 4.7 seconds from zero to 100 and its peak speed is 266 km/h.
The price is also interesting in Finland, initially said to be EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, although when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford will not tell you when you report.
The favourite brand Kia presented at the Frankfurt car exhibition two new ones - such as the new Sportage and Optima
In Finland, two of the new ones are certainly more important than the new Fourth Generation Sportage, where Kia intends to catch a larger wing from the ever-growing street tourism market.
The new European designer, Gregory Guillaumen, created by his fashion Sportage, is more round than ever.
The axle intervals and the outer dimensions have come another centimeter here and the car breaks the air more efficiently.
The engine range is in its main characteristics as well, but it has been added to 177 horse power-developing turbo 1.6 litre.
More about Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption will be reported closer to sales revenue.
It will have to be waited a little longer, because we will have a new Sportage coming in in the spring of 2016.
Even before the change of year, the new Kia Optimat arrived in our country.
Suddenly, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
Kia intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle-class buyers with better driving properties, lower noise levels and higher-level equipment.
Starting with 1,7 litre turbodiesel and 2,0 litre petrol engine Optimums.
Next summer, the pace will accelerate when Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbo engine.
In the same time with that income, Optima Farmer's sale begins.
Chisu came back to the stages. He blew up in a bold snare.
The singer Chisu is part of the Life for a child concert with other domestic stars.
An electric blue trouser suit has to be displayed with an open neck hole.
The dress is beautifully presented by the singer star's waist.
The whole crown of golden metal belt and red lipstick.
During a three-year break, the singer has been beaten by light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be a year soon.
The singer published his first single from the new album in August.
Back to the stages and to the public after a long break, I'm not really excited.
I've missed everything you do about music, the singer tells me.
In a couple of weeks, Chisu will publish his new and fourth album called Polaris.
The new state of life has inspired the making of new songs.
At this point, you're wondering if people find my new album, Chisu's thinking.
Kim Kardashian's motherhood style is astonishing again. Now there's a chest.
Real TV beauty Kim Kardashian is giving talks one after another.
He presents his pregnancy and breast-feeding gently in sexy clothes last night at one American time when he left his sister Kourtney Kardashian's husband from Kanye West's club.
Black motherhood dress is transparent from the breasts.
It reveals the skin colored bras underneath the flashlights.
The last time Kardashian was dressed in an amazing motherhood costume when he visited his friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The apartment was highlighted by the black super-pollution boots.
The third special mother-in-law is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation was on her pregnancy.
Model World Hard Laws: No Home, You're Lonely, The Competition Is Terrible
The top model Manon Leloup wanted to shorten the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne celebrations.
He made his own documentary film Speaking Dolls (speaking dolls), where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths clean about the model business.
Harpeer's Bazaar compiled Leloup's six hard truths behind the scenes.
Every season starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the previous season you would have popped in top designers' costumes, the new season will start again with castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces who compete for work with the crows.
The models rarely have a place they can call home.
The work is continuous travel and can go for a year so that the accommodation is a hotel room or apartment where the fashionable houses accommodate their models.
If you are very young, and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearable.
New York and Paris are desired jobs, but they are all more stressful.
There's not just one kind of skinny thing.
Agent New York may ask for a drop of pounds, but in Paris, they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
In fashion weeks, models and designers are all the time together, working as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the difference is filthy.
The models want to this sector because of the opportunities it offers, but it is the fact that everyone thinks that the work is just the presentation of clothes.
The models also want to be their own personalities.
The work makes the models feel like they're actors who have a role to play.
But in the work of the model you can also express yourself.
You were at Tory Burch's show last night.
New York is currently celebrating fashion scenes where designers will reveal their modelling next year.
Roope Salminen, who changed his style, plays the most unfamiliar Apulanta musician in the film
Roope Salminen presents Antti Lautala, the founding member of the band's film based on the early years of the Apulanta Group.
The board was founded in 1991 with Toni Wirtase, but separated from the group in 1994.
This is a pretty big challenge for me, because I'm about 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to see the real Antti before the shots, because I want to make her my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly for people from that group to the unknown, so I think it's really good that I'm just learning his playing style from the video.
I don't want to make a man's imitation.
It's not like Roope Salminen and the Dogs' group, a man who's not going to play a role.
The Punk Manners come with the man from nature.
Stars, Stars, I'm sure a lot of people in the punk season saw a preview, as well as if they've ever been to our jobs.
Our performance has never been a small soul, but we always go full.
You made us the main performers of the beautiful film that played the bass in Auula in 1993-2004, Tuukka Temose led by Tuukka Basso today.
The band's nuclear forces are still presenting to the large audience a rather unknown young actor.
Rumpali Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirta from Tatu Sinisalo basisti Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave advice about his future butt yesterday night, when he told Snapchat that he was mysteriously preparing for his career for the most important day.
Roope has already published in Instagram yesterday a picture of his new look that he has had to perform for the film.
Roope, previously seen in the soup and the jaw, has shaved his face into a moustache, and blurred his brown hair into black.
Psychologist counsels: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have been forced in recent days to consider how to tell the child the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or should I tell you anything about it?
There is no need to be a force on this, Mr Ferdinand Garoff, member of the SPR crisis group, advises.
Smaller children should be protected, for example, and not allowed to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay around in mind and trouble," he says.
However, if a child has encountered television news pictures of refugees or heard about it elsewhere, it is worth speaking.
It is good to have a discussion at the beginning of the child and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fears of a child may be surprising.
They're not necessarily the ones older people think he's afraid.
You don't want to scare the child in vain, even if you're angering yourself and scaring yourself.
The younger child closely follows the behavior of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also experience being safe.
Bigger children are likely to come across a conversation about refugees in school, with friends or online.
Parents are good to talk to them if you think about a child.
The fact is, everyone in the world is not doing well.
Parents, together with children, may wonder how our family is to deal with this.
However, at the end of the day, do we think the world is a safe or unsafe place?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family also talks about difficult things, the child gets a model of how to deal with the difficulties ahead of life.
This could be of benefit to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your child to help the weaker"
The end of your own powers?
You can still be a good parent to your child
Difficult control of the Pallosalamaa attacking Vermoon
Pertusa North had the Apila Pallosalama washed off in the middle of the summer.
It only shook profits and two-stops until at the end of July, the Tampere ravens collapsed.
Since Ori was completely blurred, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a period of protection from the veterinarian.
The explanation for the extinguishment survived in the search.
The horse had an inflammation of the throat.
The disease wasn't from the mild end, but it took two doctors to choke it.
Since Apila's ballroom had to be in a light exercise, the North says he was positively surprised at the last run of the horse.
It was in Turku's récord after the second S.E.U.U. after the S.E.U.
Apila's Pallosalama was very pressurized when it had been able to drive normally for only a few weeks.
The small inclination of those things at the end was understandable, says the North.
The coach assumes that a good competition made a sledge.
The horse's path certainly went forward, and I hope it would also have stabilized.
Apila's ballroom has been so-called humour horses.
When it hasn't been amused, it could have been thrown into fat without any sickness.
On a good day, however, a lightning chip has been removed from the squirrels that the opponents have been marvelous.
At the speed of the racers, even warm-blooded riders can't make it to the ballroom.
In Vermo, there's a peas race in the north.
However, the different issue is how Apila's Ballroom will agree.
It's kind of hard to get out of here, and it might just be slamming under the truck's booth and stuff.
I hope the squirrel would be calmer already than when Turku left.
The Pallosalama of Apila can also come from the bow when it's okay, and we're going to drive with it, the coach promises.
That's why you can't get rid of futile iPhone programs.
Apple's CEO Tim Cook.
At least some of Apple's iPhone phones with future programs may sometimes be removed in the future - but not all.
Apple will possibly remove some of its own programs from iPhone phones in the future, reports the company's CEO Tim Cook Buzzfeed at the interview.
Apple's iPhone has a number of programs that are relatively few to use: FaceTime phones, Lehtikioski, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Tinks come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became a mandatory update on iPhone phones, although it is necessary only for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says eliminating Apple's programs is more complicated than it looks.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook says to Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone apps work firmly with other programs.
There are other programmes that do not work this way.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to let the user remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it because the company doesn't want to waste the memory space on the iPhone phones of users.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1 per cent in August
In August, the euro area consumer prices rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, Eurostat reported today by the EU statistical authority.
Price rises were brought down to cheaper energy.
Eurostat thus revised the forecast of 0.2 % slightly down from a couple of weeks ago.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2 per cent.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in August from 1.0 per cent in July.
Eurostat's preliminary estimate of baseline inflation was 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area was 7.2 per cent cheaper last month than it was a year ago.
The average inflation in the EU of 28 countries as a whole was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The euro countries, or 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, increased most in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was the lowest when prices fell by 1.9%.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2 per cent minus the EU's harmonised price index.
Inflation in the euro area is still very far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is a two-percent increase in prices in the medium term.
On average, the ECB forecasts a 0.1 % inflation for this year in the euro area.
Next year's rise will rise to 1.1%, the central bank anticipates its publication in its new inflation forecasts at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed is next trying to blackmail monetary policy
The next US mortgage begins at its fastest in less than a year, but most certainly within three years after the country's central bank Fed starts again for a long time to raise its interest rates.
And on the financial markets, the downhill starts before the next recession.
The Fed has suggested starting interest rates this week and not later than the end of the year.
Thus, the next leak can be pressed on by the fastest by next autumn and as the financial market's exchange rate before that.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economic and financial markets operate as they used to - and if they react to the blackmail of Fed's money as they have done before.
Such conclusions have been concluded by the German Bank of Deutsche Bank in its long-term market and economic cycle investigations by Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker.
The Bank distributed more than 60 pages of the Long-Term Asset Return Study report to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the research and report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will start raising interest or what will happen in the economy and the market thereafter.
Instead, by means of the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, they present how the economy and the market have previously behaved at and after Fed's interest rates.
In addition to historical observations, they will examine what key economic and financial variables are now in the same or in another model as at previous interest rates - and what will possibly be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a better position to endure the rise in interest rates than they were before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recession may not be a year.
Fed's monetary policy and its decision-makers have been all along last summer and early autumn suggesting that the time begins to grow.
The first interest rate increase for more than nine years can come this week.
It will be decided within Wednesday and Thursday, when the so-called Open Market Committee of the Fed Board meets to decide on the matter at its two-day meeting.
For the last time, Fed raised the so-called Fed Funds control interest rate in June 2006.
At that time, a relatively regular but at the same time a series of small 0.25 percentage points of interest rates ended for just two years, with Fed raising its interest rates from 1.25% to 5.25%.
The financial market symptom began in 2007 with the most risky housing financing of the United States, and a year later the financial crisis collapsed into a global nightmare of the day of judgment.
The major recession took place in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economic downturns began slower than the previous Fed interest rates have typically occurred.
Similarly, the trials were harder and harder than once since the 1930s.
Deutsche's strategies have screened the rises and falls in the world's largest economies, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950 and always since the beginning of the 1800s.
Fed's interest rates and their economic and financial impacts have been reported since the 1950s.
The first interest rate rate has been lower than one year, mostly less than three years and an average of less than three and a half years.
The rate increase in financial markets has ended within two years of the start of Fed's interest rates.
The Fed has in turn raised and in turn lowered its steering interest rate after the early 1950s by a dozen different cycles.
Each time it has differed from some of the others, and it is relatively scarce in the review, so it is hardly possible to conclude anything certain about the effects of the following interest rates.
Strategies therefore remind us that many things are different this time.
And not just better.
The interest rates are too low for too long
The crucial reasons for the financial crisis may not necessarily be undeniably cleared by even decades of research.
But for three reasons which led to the crisis and caused its destructive power, it seems to be somewhat undeniably clear:
1) In the 21st century, Fed, the ECB of the euro area and other world's largest central banks held their steering interest rates too long.
They placed the traces of the techno bubble, and at the same time raised the next one.
2) Over the decades, the accumulated and already too large debt in the various parts of the financial and real economy increased the central banks' surplus from the impact of monetary policy.
The largest bubble of debt in the economic history so far was born.
3) In particular, the craziness of debt financing in the financial economy, which was almost impregnated, swept up the largest exchange bubbles in most financial market segments until then from shares to real estate, debt securities and commodities.
Nor does it make it very hard to argue that the financial markets that have risen to heights with increasingly complicated debt tips were rarely dangerous and unstable when the Fed and other central banks last drove interest up.
The financial structures in place for debt bonds could not last until their time after interest rates had started and the cost of debt financing had increased.
The risks were realised as a financial crisis and followed by a major decline.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutsche's strategies do not guess what's going to happen next, but they give an insight into the subject by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other large central banks have now considered their monetary policy to be even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) Indebtedness has not been crazy for a long time as it was ten years ago, but now the debt money is cheaper literally than it is free.
Thus, the debt burden of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now in the various parts of the economy the debt burden is much heavier than before or ever before the financial crisis.
3) Liquidity from the former league and cheaper central banks has largely remained on the financial markets and has reduced the key types of securities and assets to their most expensive peaks since the financial crisis or at any time.
And not only with the warning signals of the financial markets, they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the hardest decline in decades to the model that it has ever been.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but in the same way the pressure and risks of the financial markets are unreasonably greater than before the financial crisis, when the next Fed begins to tighten its money.
Perhaps the image of the future of the French bank of Societe General's strategic Albert Edwards is not as strange as the sudden can affect.
For a good time, he has trained the bank's international investor customers in the following full translations of Fed:
First, the Fed raises interest rates, then the financial bubbles explode, and soon, it's time for Fed to run off the financial fires with even bigger QE cash chips.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) manufacturer of computers and printers intends to reduce up to 33000 jobs.
The majority of the reductions are against HP's business service side, the company reports.
In November, HP is divided into the Hewlett Packard Enterprise, a company focusing on business sales, and the HP Inc., a company focusing on SMEs and printers.
HP's staff were the largest in 2011, when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, staff had been reduced to 302000.
The company accounts for one-off costs of $2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) in the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise reduces 25,000-30,000 employees.
The reductions in the consumer side will remain at 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to low-cost countries so that 60% of its employees would be in low-cost countries in 2018.
The company reports that it has already balanced its business so that none of its customers will be responsible for more than 10% of its business outcome.
Another year, its three most important customers brought 65% of the business output.

General: Minister Berner has worked in the government of the tax paradise company
The Minister for Transport and Communication Anne Berner (center) has, according to Yle, served as a member of the Board of the Tax Paradise Company.
I'm proud of the company's activities related to so-called tax planning.
This is the Luxembourg company Saltri II LuxCo, which was appointed member of the Board of Directors Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg business register, Berner is still an official member of the government.
Berner himself says he left a notice of resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and that's enough for me to leave a divorce statement.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains take place within the agreed timetable, Berner says in the Yle interview.
Membership after merger
The ownership of the Swedish Kährs is managed through the Luxembourg company.
Kährs is a parket manufacturer who merged with the Finnish parket manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served in Karelia-Upofloor's Government in 2010-2013 and after merger in Kährs' Government and in the Luxembourg company.
I'm proud of the fact that Kährs' ownership is going through a multi-stage ownership structure in Luxembourg.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted a government membership in the Luxembourg company Kährs' second largest owner at the request.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been part of the Karelia-Upofloor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was asked for a partner found in Sweden.
This company owned a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I experienced that my own task was to ensure that the Finnish family company's capital interests were realized.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital gains are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that the ownership of Hartwall Capital is not related to tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure created in tax paradise is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs had a capital fund for ownership already prepared for the Luxembourg holding company.
Espoo opens a reception centre maintained by the company
In Espoon Otaniem, the first reception centre maintained by the company will be opened for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from tonight.
A maximum of 300 to 400 people may increase within a week.
The Immigration Agency shall establish a reception centre for the property of the former Rescue College.
The activities are maintained by Luona Oy, which is the sector of the provision of health care and medical services in particular.
The city of Espoo, the Immigration Agency and Luona Oy agreed, among other things, on the security arrangements of the Centre.
STTK prepares alternative work life extortion package
STTK undertakes to prepare an alternative package for government labour blackmails.
The organisation also hopes for other employees' central organisations.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being paid to Friday's expression of mind.
Alternative means to reduce the price of work will then be returned.
Everyone understands that life will continue after Friday, Palola pointed out the organization's government meeting at a break to journalists.
Palola believes that the Central Trade Union (EC) is not prepared for discussions.
The STTK economists have calculated that the change security contained in the government's competitiveness package pays the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the other side of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a terrible zeal to have a debate on the part of a one-sided relationship with a hundred.
Palola: Negotiation was constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, because then the government is to make its own package a communication to the Parliament and start preparing for reforms.
The ball did not take the view that the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a debate with the government and it has been constructive all along.
According to Palola, operation of Sundays is particularly painful in the STTK field.
The organisation requires that the government withdraw from mandatory legislation in order to carry out some of the blackmails.
According to the STTK, Palola does not allow the alternative package to be prepared with the SDP that has presented it.
Employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the blackmail package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, the first day's sickness wages are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The STTK stresses that the Central Organisations have invited employees to manifest their minds and that they have not intended to take place a strike.
Akavan Fjäder says thank you.
Mr Akava's President, Mr Fjäder, thanks the STTK's report on the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjäder, STTK is now on the same lines with Akava, as Akava has already developed an alternative model for government presentations.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also be included in the alternative package, as without the SAK the package is not sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Akava's President, Mr Fjäder, hopes that Lauri Lyly, led by the SK, will come along to prepare a proposal for an option for surgery.
Ms Palola STTK said earlier on Wednesday that she was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, Mr Akava informed that he has long prepared his own proposal to negotiate a five-percent competitive leap for the country's government as an option for cuts.
Akava has been ready to negotiate all the time, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government presentations.
We are prepared to see the terms of the service relationship as part of the agreement.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjäder hopes that the SAK will also come to the Akava lines, as STTK has done earlier on Wednesday.
Without the SADC, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The Akava Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. on the possible content of the agreement.
"The same boat, common coal, talkoot" - plays bingo when Sipilä talks tonight
Tampere University's Green Left
Tampere University's green left Viva bingo coupon for the night.
The Prime Ministers have previously made exceptional speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation about the state of Finland's economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday night at 9:05 p.m.
The previous request for a similar Prime Minister must be made until 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister when he held a famous radio speech, which marked the beginning of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made a number of radio talks during the winter and continuum war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho held a speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the train drivers' strike on television.
Solitary call, monarchic cunning
Sipilä's speech has raised criticism and guessing all day long about what's to come.
The president of the Left Union, Paavo Arhinmäki, on Twitter, said that "Sipilä could hold his speech on the status of the nation in the delegation as a statement by the Prime Minister, so that the speech could also be discussed".
According to the Greens, Ville Soysto, "single call has already been seen.
Leadership includes dialogue, listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Judgments on Facebook condemned that "monarchicism: the Prime Minister tells the people what's best for it."
The President of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipilä's dialogue: "A few six months from the elections.
There's nothing more to be done by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
It's tried.
What's @juhasi pila afraid of?
Public service
According to the State Council's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and takes about 15 minutes.
According to the SGC, it was commented directly by the SGC President Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyri Häkämies.
Most people have been criticized for making Sipilä's speech.
We considered it and stated that it is a public service task to promote the full publicity throughout Finland, a line for the Director of Yle's publications in Ismo Silvo Yle's news.
♪ Like us at the time of the Tammelo ♪
The speech has also been aroused by decay.
Evening dinner will be enjoyed in good time, children will be peeled and dressed at their best.
Mom puts on the most beautiful bell and Dad puts the tie in his neck.
At 9:00 a.m., the TV is quieted as before in the time of Me Tammeloi," writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Is Prime Minister Sipilä also speaking about the fact that in the Finnish government millions of people who hide their capitals in tax paradise are sitting in the capitals of the Finnish government who draw up pardon laws for their fellow tax evaders while claiming to the people that they have to cut when the state is out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is to present the University of Tampere's green left Viva.
It's been posted on Facebook by a bingo.
Do we hear about the same boat, coal, living in debts, and the spirit of a team tonight?
Coupons and pencils ready, at 9:05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Arena.
Attaché Island in Guardian: The Western countries rejected the Russian proposal to remove Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to give up power, reports to President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian UN ambassador proposed a plan for Al-Assad to have stylishly escaped power some time later.
However, the Western countries did not accept the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk listed him in a bilateral debate three plans: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and Al-Assad had to be immediately contacted and Al-Assad's withdrawal of power had to be carried out with restraint.
I know Tshurkin.
We do not necessarily agree on all matters, but we are able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there and he said, "Sit Alas, Martti, and I'll tell him what we have to do," Ahtisaari remembers at the Guardian interview.
Diplomats do not comment
The Ahtisaari reports that it transmitted the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing happened.
The Czech Republic did not confirm the content of the debate in the press, but according to the Ahtisaari there are no two words about it.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that at that time Al-Assad forces had already committed several mass murders and that key opposition groups had refused all agreements in which they would have remained in power.
The former Director of the Department of the Middle East of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Sir John Jenkins, has doubts about the talks of Ahtisaari, because, according to his experience, Russia was at no point prepared to discuss the fate of Al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke with Moscow's delegation.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have responded that I would like to hear from President Vladimir Putin the same thing so that I could take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, even in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's trick to hold power on some al-Assad supporter.
Refuge flow of our own actions
During the negotiations on the Ahtisaari, about 7,500 people were killed in the Syrian crisis.
According to the UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have stopped this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill that we ourselves caused, Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Centre for asylum seekers with tyrky in Tornio
The settlement centre for asylum seekers planned by the Government in Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the centre of the city in an empty building of the Tornion coalition.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought a suitable place for better control of the flow of refugees from the Swedish border.
Helsing said on Tuesday that the Council had already decided to present the school building as a single solution to the Ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppisen, Vice-President of the Town Council of Tornion, this is not true.
When the whole council was not gathered and some of the people wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the council meeting next Monday to decide on the matter, he will specify to the STT.
There were 36 representatives of 43 at the meeting.
The organisational centre was opposed to 13 delegates.
On the basis of that, you could expect a decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to city leader Timo Nousiainen, the city received contact on Monday, and responded quickly.
An estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time would be eligible for the joint agreement.
The expert has visited to verify that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a couple hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
Sipilä still wants a job market option for tightening
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center), half of the public holiday money would only cover part of the calculation of the cost of work sought by the government.
However, the government would like to accept an alternative package if the labour market organisations were able to agree on such a package.
Mr Sipilä told the journalists that he had not been in contact with the labour market organisations.
Nor did he know how seriously organizations are looking for alternatives to the blackmails announced by the government.
If such an agreement is to be concluded, we will certainly welcome it as part of the package.
Halfing the holiday money would be a way to work because it would target almost all employees, unlike, for example, the surgery of Sundays by the government.
The labour market organisations could agree on a cut in holidays because they have been registered in collective agreements rather than in law.
The government will present these views to the Parliament next week on Wednesday as a communication from the Council of State on the extortion of working life.
Mr Sipilä said that the proposals of the organisations should be known before this.
It's not the final back line either.
The legislative work then moves, which means that the train is on the move and is becoming more difficult.
It's a good time.
It won't take long in such matters if there is will, Sipilä formulated it.
The list published last week by the government includes, inter alia, the conversion of the endowment and the helatorta to unpaid days without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, the first day's sickness wages are cut, overtime allowances are halved, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and holidays are reduced.
The reforms are being carried out as a compelling legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
The work of the Employee Centres will result in a major demonstration on Friday, and many trade unions have also declared political strikes.
The Tohma Lake Council approved the extension of the Mahlahalli storage
The Tohma Lake Council unanimously approved the extension of the Nordic Koivu Oy's government, or the Mahlahalli's warehouse.
The criticism caused the project to be bigger and more expensive than originally spoken.
The busy timetable was also tireless.
It was also a little wondered that the need for space was not known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, an extension of the stock at 400-450 square metres was approved for the investment programme, but the money will be decided in the context of the interim report.
The next item was the investment of EUR 150 000 to EUR 200 000, but at the meeting, technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the price is estimated to be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenue to the locality.
The municipality has no risk, as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (p.) justified.
Even for Karelia's language in Joensuu
The city's government mild its earlier strong position to bring the street towns of Karelia into the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and correct in view of the promotion of the livestock tradition in the whole province.
Joensuu is not declared the capital of the karelian language because there are no historical grounds for it and the karelian language is a natural part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu has been more part of the eastern Savorian fractures.
Even after a new decision, there will be no street-name towns in the city centre.
However, the city of Joensuu is, on a case-by-case basis, also ready for use in the livestock language, for example, in information boards and in the marketing of tourism.
The same attitude is recommended by the city for all other players.
Although Joensuu is officially a one-language municipality, the use of Karelia should also be cautious now that multiculturalism lives and changes vigorously in North Karelia.
Karelia's language is still the special features of the province, as is the image of Joensuu as the entire forest capital of Finland.
Both of them can well be used for the benefit of the multinational marketing of the province.
Discontinuation of train connections cuts the viability of the province
Train connection cuts hit the viability of the province with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the region's business and competitiveness.
And that's the effect that if we can live and work here at all, Joensuu City Director Kari Karjalainen wonders.
He also highlights air transport, which has also continued on several occasions in his report.
It is important for the whole of the province that we do not succeed in reducing our chances with State measures, as is happening now.
We should look at the impact of the closures of these transport links on employment, for example, Karjalainen stresses.
The deterioration of transport connections creates an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here are, such as transport connections and housing situation, the easier it is to get students and employees, says Jukka Mönkkönen, director of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor connections also affect the research board, which is very moving and travels a lot because of research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Chief of Recruitment, says that the marketing of the university to Western Finland is already difficult because of the short-term connections.
Approximately half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland currently come from outside of Eastern Finland.
On the other hand, about 10-20 per cent of them are from Newland, which is partly explained by direct train connection.
Joensuu became one of my rings for the war of Siu.
The view of the city government of Joensuu on the provincial Siu War project is apparently unanimous, but one of my soraois is one.
The city government member Pentti Mediasalo (sd., in the picture) presented the total abandonment of the project at the government meeting on Monday, but his presentation was unsustainable.
The Board of Directors adopted a draft decision by Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will deliver a final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Eagle to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train transport from Kouvola to Kouvola will remain in the future, even though it is less than one train cabiner.
There will be changes in passenger train transport between Kouvola and Kouvola next March.
One train couple will be gone, but five times a day will still get out of Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to state savings.
For the next four-year period, EUR 12.3 million will be reduced for the purchase of trains by the Ministry of Transport and Communications.
The quietest routes are completely stopped.
The VR will draw up new schedules by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed the roof, one didn't get down, the guys slipped out of the place.
The rescue plant let the 12-year-old climbing up the roof, who couldn't get off the roof with his own help.
The situation was born at the Tornion hill on the Ketoway at six and a half on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-storey wooden house with no ladders to the roof.
It did not prevent the boys who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mast of the radiologists next to it.
The other boys got the same way down, but one didn't.
The result was that the rest of the people slipped out of the place and the passengers alerted the rescue facility to help with the bettings to the last roof safely back to the earth.
FedEx's turnover fluctuation, weaker outlook for 2016
FedEx published its weak results in the last quarter. The transport sector declined its projection for the year as a result of the decline in demand for freight services and increased costs of land transport.
The company intends to hire 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers during the holidays.
The company's share decreased by about 2.5 per cent 45 minutes before the opening of the actual trade on Wednesday.
FedEx's forecast is between $10.40 and $10.90 for the financial year ending in May. The forecast has a drop of 20 cents compared to the previous forecast.
According to FactSet's research, the analysts predicted $10.84.
In spite of price increases of 4.9% on average, the forecast has declined. The increases will enter into force on 4 January. Additional charges for the transport of heavy or large-scale shipments will enter into force in November.
The company is still looking forward to performance growth from the previous year thanks to cost cuts, increased turnover and growth in network trade.
The president and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company has been undergoing a well-expected weaker economic situation, particularly in terms of production and global trade.
The seasonal recruitment plans were reported on the day after the competitor UPS announced its plans to employ the same proportion of seasonal workers as last year, i.e. 90,000 to 95,000 people.
In the quarter of 31 August, FedEx's operating profit amounted to $692 million, an increase of 6%.
The share income was $2.42, so the projection of the 12 analysts of the Zacks Investment Research company, $2.44, was left.
Turnover increased by five per cent to $12.3 billion.
According to six analysts interviewed by Zacks Investment Research, turnover was expected to be 12.23 billion.
In recent years, FedEx has been experiencing a decline in international first-class broadcasts, which has led to a downturn in the operation of the company's Express unit.
The strong growth of network trade has strengthened FedEx Ground's result.
Last quarter, turnover in land transport increased by 29 per cent, but the operating profit showed increased costs of large-scale broadcasting and insurance.
Thanks to higher basic charges, the Express unit was better profitable, while the return on freight operations was lower due to higher labour costs.
About an hour before the opening of the actual trade, FedEx's share rate had fallen to $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, the share ended by 11 % down from the average year and 17 % lower than the highest quote recorded on 11 June.
This week, the decision-makers of the United States Central Bank Fed will meet at the most expected meeting for years, sitting at an eight - meter - diameter Dutch wooden table to decide whether it is time to raise interest for the first time for almost a decade.
On the wall of the decorative, two-storey meeting room of the Central Bank, the wall painting of the United States is made up of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the President of the Central Bank Janet L. Yellen and his colleagues must set the State's financial interest before all other interests.
The Central Bank has a double order from Congress: maximize employment in the United States and keep prices stable here.
However, the management of the central bank has taken note of the third unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This mandate may be missing from the point of view of the decision on the stimulus. Thursday, the Central Bank is to state whether the US economy is ready to start the withdrawal from the unpredictable irritation offered by the short interest rates last year, which have remained close to zero.
Although most of the data show a steady growth in the economy, the recent downturn in the financial markets can already lead to the closure of prudent central bank officials to alarm the increase in volatility by raising the federal tax reference rate — even in the quarter of the percentage unit.
"The labour market and inflation are, of course, the first and most important in their practical monitoring," says Stifel Nicolaus & Co's main economist Lindsey M. Piegza.
"I believe, however, that if the central bank seeks an excuse not to raise taxes, the increased uncertainty on the global market is to give sufficient reason to wait," Piegza continues.
They do not agree on what the central bank intends to do, which in itself already causes nervousness.
Approximately half of the economists in Bloomberg's study were staggering interest rates this week.
However, the financial markets are expected to be expected by the central bank and, according to the main indicator, there is only a 30% chance of an increase.
If the central bank raises its steering rate, the stock rates may be calculated unless the decision makers soften the impact by promising another raise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average was 228.89 points or 1.4 percentage points to 16 599.85 points.
"The background of the review was expectations that the central bank will keep the steering rate stable this week," said Moody's Capital Markets Research Group's main economics John Lonski.
"It would be a surprise if the central bank raised interest at this stage," he said.
"If this is the case, the central bank should carefully consider how to keep the hands of those operating on the financial markets untreated."
On the other hand, the experts stated that raising interest rates could calm the financial markets and eliminate the uncertainty about when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be inclined to raise interest rates by 0.25 percentage points this month, which would be the first small step towards tightening the financial conditions and thus strengthening the recovery of the United States.
Yelle has stated throughout the spring and early summer that he has expected to raise interest rates this year – despite the fact that liberals say that economic progress is needed.
Although job creation slowed down in August, growth in the labour market has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1 per cent last month, which is now at the lowest of seven years and close to the level that the central bank calculates as full employment.
Wage income seems to cheer up
Although inflation continued to fall below the annual central bank's 2 per cent targets, the central bank's decision makers stated that the main reason for this is the temporary impact of oil prices.
"The economy can manage even with higher interest rates and it needs them, as long as they take into account the tight labour market situation," said Pantheon Macroeconomics' main economicsman Ian Shepherdson.
However , the financial markets around the world were not shocked last month when China devalidated its currency .
Dow Jones' industrial average dropped up to 16 percentage points from the May record height and investors feared that China's economic downturn would also affect global growth.
The market has been thriving this month, and Dow Jones has already dropped by almost 10% of the top readings in May.
Market volatility means that the consideration of the steering rate increase will become more complicated for the central bank's decision-makers.
"The work of the Central Bank is complicated despite what happened in the financial markets and the news about the deterioration of the Chinese economy in recent weeks," said UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate Senior Researcher and former Central Bank official Stephen D. Oliner.
Now he believes that the central bank will expect at least a month to be able to deal with the effects.
"There is great uncertainty about what will have an impact on the US economy. There is little reliable information about the post-China economic developments," said Olier.
Rehabilitation of the world economy is not the central bank's main concern, so in principle it should not affect the decision-making of the central bank.
In practice, however, the central bank is the most powerful entity in the world's monetary economy.
The impact of the Central Bank has been enormous in recent years.
In 2013, just a hint from the then President Ben S. Bernanken that the central bank could reduce its scope led to revolutions around the world.
In today's world, markets and economies are closely interconnected, and, in addition to global development monitoring, the central bank also requires contact with other central banks and experts in order to have a good overall picture of the world economy.
"The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science," said Zachary Karabell, CEO of the Global Strategy of Envestnet Inc.
President Jeffrey Lacker of Richmond's regional central bank said this month that the central bank has previously overreacted to financial market movements that do not seem to be linked to the basic economic pillars.
Mr Lacker, the Federal Open Market Committee (FEDERAL Open Market Committee), has called for an increase in the steering rate, which was an example of the decisions taken in 1998 and 1999.
"The Asian economic crisis led to the central bank's decision at three meetings to lower the steering rate by 0.75 percentage points, although only limitedly identifiable sanctions were available for US economic growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the central bank repealed the decision.
"The central bank should put monetary stability first in a major crisis, as in the 2008 economic collapse," said Adam S. Posen, former member of the Bank of England interest committee.
The latest shovel does not even get close to the chairs," he said.
"There is no point in fearing the rise of corpses because of the shock of the market," added Peterson Institute for International Economics Posen.
"The Federal Reserve Act still has a double regime, and it doesn't mention monetary stability, and before this change comes, I don't think we should go ahead of things."

Brazil's Rio Grande Children's Association promotes a good diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Association of Children's Physicians of Rio Grande has developed a blind way to teach breastfeeding women the meaning of a proper diet. They are presented with pictures of babies breast-feeding with pictures of unhealthy food.
Human breast milk consists of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, so that the baby gets all the food he needs and can develop a strong immune system.
Due to extra energy consumption, pregnant women are advised to increase their daily calories by about 500 kilocallore.
In addition to increasing calorie levels, the new study suggests that further changes should be made to the diet.
The recent study of the Texas Baylor College of Medicine by Robert Waterland revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women can affect the genes of the baby and protect the baby from the development of tumors.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the infant's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise's most viewers, even though Nine tries to catch the lead on today's show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson denied Canberra's morning program of the post-election elections of the Liberal Party, which, however, did not much improve today's viewer numbers.
The 9-channel morning program was sent from the capital after Malcolm Turnbull was removed from Tony Abbott.
David Kochi and Samantha Armytage's competing morning channel programme was also sent from London, with a weekly special shipments from Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
It appears that the distance was not relevant for Australian television viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397 000 viewers in five state capitals, and today's programme was 339 000 viewers.
Today's viewers rose slightly to last Monday (317 000) and Tuesday (283 000) but remained to be read last Thursday (343 000).
Today, we've got a distance between Sunrise and Sunrise in the last few months.
Today had an average of 318,000 viewers in August, Sunrilla of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, there were between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
In September Sunrise has so far reached an average of 349 000 viewers and today of 314 000 viewers.
This is the most interesting event all morning.
The changes in the wind will affect Parliament more this morning.
Karl and Lisa are all right, thank you for asking!

The important novelty Seven had 800 Words series with the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama tells of a recent widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with two of his children.
Critics have doubted whether Thomson's star of the hit series alone would be enough without Rafters' star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's viewers say that the answer is clearly positive.
Sevenin The X Factor retained its strong position on 1 136 000 viewers, and the series clearly flourished The Block (838 000) and the TBL Family Series (726 000).
Sevenin The Chase Australia has been capturing viewers varyingly.
On average, 446 000 viewers were followed by Andrew O'Keefe's new visa series from the first half of the hour (17.00–17.30).
In the second half hour (17.30-18.00) the number of viewers rose to 623 000, which was more than Eddie McGuiren Hot Seat (613 000).
On Monday night, the first half of Australia's Chase had an average of 520 000 viewers, and the second half collected the top 720 000 viewers.
Hot Seat's viewer number was 620,000.
The Chase Australian second-night viewers showed Nine channels that Hot Seat will pass by again 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, who was unable to challenge McGuire's series.

The final triangle believes that Sam Wood is really the boyfriend of Dreams — but who does he choose?
Did the secret come out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unintentionally revealed the choice of the dream boyfriend.
The final choice of dream boyfriend Sam Wood has been a carefully preserved secret.
Three remaining women don't sweat a word from who's gotten the last rose from the boyfriend.
We asked Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavons-Fellows before they dropped one out of the triangle.
Sam Wood's lips are tightly sealed to the end of Thursday.
All three women glowed that Wood was a perfect man. Women praised man's sense of humor, ambition, family values and positiveness and considered him a suitable partner.
When women were asked who would be the best partner for Wood if the last rose didn't hit their own spot, their answers could give us a hint of who takes the son-in-law's heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly appointed Mackay as the most suitable partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have all been easy since the beginning.
"As soon as I arrived in the house, I noticed that Sarah and Sam were well fit. This feeling has been maintained throughout the program," said Jeavons-Fellows.
"Sarah has legs on the ground, and he's a really fun company," Markoski added.
"I have seen them together, and I must admit that there is chemistry between them.
They seem to be a natural couple.
Sarah Mackay thinks of herself and Sam Wood as a good partner.
Mackay told me he realized last week on a homemade date that Wood could be the right one.
"When I saw him in the company of my friends and my family, I realized that this is not just a race. I now put our relationship in full," Mackay said.
When they asked Mackay who Wood should choose if he didn't choose him, the woman answered mysteriously:
"I can't say," he said.
"I like other girls as much, and Snezana and Lana are equal."

Jarryd Hayne has several options for the NFL career initiative
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in Hayne's change to the United States, and several other associations were interested in the man after last year's impressive open practice day.
Hayne chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsula, and the choice seems to have hit the button.
Some coaches would have held Hayne's bench, as was the case with the Australian rugby team in line. Hayne ran off after the return of the flight shot team on Tuesday from Minnesota reading 20-3.
Tomsula, however, showed his confidence in Hayne and gave him a new opportunity to return the flight shot. The coach held Hayne in the game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula also continued his line in a suitcase after the game.
He didn't rob the incoming people in front of the other team. He encouraged them.
Tomsula also defended Hayne publicly at a press conference after the game.
The 49ers Special Journalist Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by Thomas McGaughey, coordinator of the Special Teams, who advised Hayne to forget the failed catch and focus on the next game.
Jarryd Hayne's playing a catch-up game against Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter of the game.
Hayne and his Australian fans had waited for another man from the NFL debyte.
Therene left the field in a hundred minutes after failure, and later told Hamish and Andy that 2DayFM 104.1 channels could not have imagined a worse start for his NFL career.
"This happens, and we have to move forward," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the error in the State of Origin series of her debyyt in 2007, when her input in her own area opened a place for Queensland.
The entire experience was still amazing for a 27-year-old young man.
Hayne published a photo on Instagram where he owns together with the fans and the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mihail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun at the airport in Siberia.
Openly, President Vladimir Putin's challenged Hodorkovski was condemned, the man-owned oil company Jukos was expelled and his democratic work was limited.
Four dead policemen shot with rubber bullets in Nepal
Four people died in South Nepal, the source of the government told us on Wednesday, and the police shot a bunch of people with rubber bullets in the alleged anti-constitution protest in the country, including a four-year-old son.
On Tuesday night, violence occurred in the Rupandeh region, a short distance of three hundred kilometres from the capital of Katmandu.
According to District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakali, more than 1 000 demonstrators had met outside the police station, some of whom threw rocks and fire bombs.
Dhakal told me the police were using tear gas and firing in the air before shooting rubber bullets.
He said twenty policemen and five civilians were wounded.
It is not quite clear why rubber bullets, which can kill but which are generally considered to be a less destructive alternative, were suddenly so deadly.
This was the most recent confrontation in weeks of continued protests in southern Nepal, where according to the Madhesi tribe, new provinces based on the new Constitution would undermine their political influence.
Protests have also been seen in Western Nepal, where the Tharus people demand their own country.
At least 40 people, 11 of whom are police officers, have been killed in violent raids since 10 August,
When four major political parties signed an agreement on the division of the country into the provinces, this is a major step towards a new constitution, but the issue is very sensitive in Nepal, where administration has been concentrated for centuries.
The new Constitution has been working since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process since thousands of people died in the shocking earthquake in April.
The legislators have voted on the provisions of the Constitution in Katmandu this week, and the authorities say that the new Charter could be adopted by Sunday.
NHC hurricane centre: 60 % probability for cyclone south of Cape Verde
From the vast low-pressure area, about 560 km from the southernmost parts of the Cape Verde Islands, a tropical cycle can develop within 48 hours, reported by the National Hurricane Center (National Hurricane Center) on Tuesday.
According to the Miami Institute of Air Science, there is also a clear center of low pressure in the middle of Cape Verde and Small Antilles. It can also, with a 60% probability, become a tropical cyclone over the next two days.
Google plans to collect $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced launching a campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian aid organisations to help thousands of people fleeing from war and poverty across Europe.
Google reported a donation campaign on its blog in a particularly personal way.
Instead of running the campaign, Google's employee Rita Masoud started his own experience, and he was only seven years old when he escaped from Kabul with his family.
"We traveled on a dark train and a bus and were hungry, thirsty, cold and fearful," Masoud wrote.
I was lucky.
After the heightened European refugee and migrant crisis, many families in the similar situation are desperately in need of help.
The donations are allocated to non-profit organisations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save Children ry and the UN Refugee Organization.
Once donations have been collected via google.com/refugeerelief $5.5 million, Google promises to donate the corresponding amount, bringing the total to 11 million.
The European refugee crisis has been the worst since World War II, and the situation is worsening especially in Syria's four-year civil war, which is why more than four million people have been forced to flee home this year.
The war must also escape from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Liquidly overweight diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
According to the new study, slightly overweight type 2 diabetes patients may benefit from obesity surgery for at least five years.
However, it is too early to say whether slightly overweight type 2 diabetics live longer than those treated without surgery after fatigue surgery.
"Receiving data on death takes time," said Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Dr. Robin Blackstone, who discussed the new research in JAMA Surgery.
Oxygen surgery, or bariatric surgery, reduces the stomach bag by different methods.
Surgery methods reduce the sense of hunger and limit the absorption of food in the body.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been found to be effective in treatment in type 2 diabetes. However, most of the studies have involved patients with overweight disease with a weight index (MIB) of at least 35.
The weight index indicates the weight and length of the normal value of 18,5 to 24,9.
When the weight index is more than 25, the person is overweight, and the weight index of more than 30 tells of significant obesity.
You can calculate your own weight index at 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, researchers from the Thai Min-Sheng Hospital have used data collected since 2007, in a study comparing two fatigue methods, gastrointestinal surgery and sleeve surgery, to the treatment of type 2 diabetes in slightly fat people.
After muscle surgery, the average weight index fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth research year.
The weight index of unoperated patients remained 29.
Diabetes treated with surgery improved altogether by 36% and partly by 28%.
In the treatment group, diabetes improved completely by only 1% and partly by only about 2%.
According to the study, blood pressure, triglycerides and bad LDL cholesterol were also better in the surgical group.
Researchers also monitored haemoglobin-A1c levels in patients, reflecting the development of blood sugar levels.
According to researchers, the recommended haemoglobin-A1c level is below 7%.
After surgery, the haemoglobin-A1c was reduced by an average of 9% to 6%.
In the treatment group, the value remained unchanged by approximately 8%.
However, the study group led by Dr Chih-Cheng Hsun concluded that this did not reduce mortality over five years.
The study group also compared the consequences of two different surgical methods.
In the fifth year, in the gastrointestinal cross-section group, the weight loss was higher than in the sleeve cutting group (18.7 and 14.2 kg), the weight loss index was higher (7.4 and 5.1), as was the haemoglobin-A1c level (3.1 per cent and 2.1 per cent).
The new research was not able to show lower mortality after five years. However, according to the Swedish Blackstone study of Phoenix University of Arizona College of Medicine, surgery will bring years of life to fat people.
In the Swedish study, the likelihood of death during 15 years was reduced by 29 per cent compared to the traditional treatment group.
However, although no lower mortality was observed in the new investigation, Blackstone confirmed that persons with a weight index below 35 could benefit from the measure.
"This is the most important discovery of the study, because it says surgery is safe in the lower weight index group, and it does not increase the risk of loss or kidney disease," Blackstone wrote.
According to Blackstone, people and doctors should be serious about weight when the weight index is 27 to 30.
"We wait too long for people to start taking the situation seriously," the researcher said.
"When genetic changes are accumulated in the human body that are exposed to fattyness and diabetes, turning the situation is really difficult."
"Everybody cannot come to Europe" Dalai Lama – RT News
Europe is unable to receive all refugees, Dalai Lama has said, and he believes that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The leadership of Tibetan Buddhism has demanded the cessation of violence in the homelands of refugees.
Dalai-lama addressed the refugee crisis in his visit to the United Kingdom. Dalai-lama spoke at the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which focuses on ethical research.
According to Dalai-lama, in the present situation, humanity should be placed before individual countries or parts of the country.
He also stressed that although the reaction of the Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is not sufficient in this situation.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," said Dalai-lama in his speech.
Although Dalai-lama thanked Germany and Austria for their efforts in the crisis, he stressed that the solution was only temporary.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is a great act, but at the same time there are long-term solutions to be considered and how we can achieve genuine peace and real development in these Islamic countries, mainly through education," stressed Dalai-lama.
"We must, in the end, consider how we can reduce the killings in these countries.
The use of force shall be reduced.
The means of power have never solved problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions in the context of the terror attacks of 11 September and argued that, when he resorted to force in responding to the terrorist attack, the United States created an uncontrolled chain of events.
"After the attacks on 11 September, I expressed my regrets to President Bush and told him that the solution was through violence.
I know that his purpose was good, but he resorted to the means of power that had unpredictable consequences," Dalai-lama said.
Hand swallowing cases in children four times in four years
According to the Georgian Intoxication Centre, poisoning centres across the United States report a strong hand swallowing rate of alcohol in nearly fourfold children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Gaylord Lopez, director of Georgia's poisoning centers, the cases of hand swallowing reported in children under the age of 12 increased from 3 266 in 2010 to 16 117 in 2014.
"These products are more and more accessible to children, and unfortunately some of the children are in the first place," López told CNN.
According to Lopez, children drink hands on purpose, part to impress their friends and part of the social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers who drink disinfectant for cheap drunkenness.
Teens are told to mix alcoholic water in the disinfectant to make drinking stronger.
You can attract smaller children to the smell of the hands.
"The child doesn't think that the substance is bad," Lopez said.
"A large part of the attractive handmade products are just perfumed.
There are handmade products of strawberry, grapes and orange that appeal to children."
The alcoholic strength of desinfectants is 45 to 95 %.
A small amount of alcohol poisoning can already be caused to young children.
"The alcohol content of the patient is very high," Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the National University Hospital poisoning, told the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
"No one would leave children out of reach for whiskey shots, but if hand desinfecting products are often left out of reach for children, they will quickly get a large amount of alcohol."
Nhaijah Russell, a six - year - old, recently enjoyed four lorries of strawberry hands in school, and the girl was delivered for first aid.
"The alcohol content of a girl's blood was 179, which is twice as high as the adult's humiliation," reports a girl's nurse doctor Chris Ritchey from the Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Nhaijah couldn't walk when he was brought in first aid.
The doctors followed the girl's space overnight in a separate children's hospital in case of brain damage, because she had fallen down and beat her head after enjoying alcohol," Ritchey told me.
"The situation was really scary," Nhaijah's mother Ortor Scott told CNN.
My daughter could have died.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products and disinfection towels in addition to transferring your hands to children.
In addition to alcohol abuse, some disinfectants have been combined with death.
In 2013, two Ontarioan women died after swallowing hands containing a toxic substance that had not been reported.
Health authorities believed that the product contained deadly methanol instead of ethyl alcohol, although the latter has been reported to be the active substance in the package leaflet.
According to the police report, three four-class pupils in the north of New York State planned in January to kill a "sad" teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom.
The teacher is extremely allergic to the hands and refused to bring it into the classroom.
The police found that the lost plan was meaningless and called for disciplinary action.
Rumory: not inconsistent with Celtic's lines
Griffith reduces the incompatibility of the Celtic team, while Deila admits that the team is not all right but believes that it's going to be okay.
Hearts clicked against SFA on the punishment of Neilson, and Warburton warns of the January transfers so that the team's unity will not suffer
Aberdeen's neck to Celtic five points
The first half of ADAM Rooney's punishment brought Aberdeen a small victory from Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium. The victory raised Aberdeen's five-point escape from Celtic.
Griffiths tries to reduce speeches about dissatisfaction.
Griffiths has disregarded the rumors of a dissolution in Celtic's rows. According to his own words, Griffiths and his team are not the subject of surveillance in preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
"I don't think we're under pressure, but I think the players are waiting to meet you.
The Dutch need an old Scottish match – de Boer
Former Rangers' middle-field player and Dutch team rider Ronald de Boer has stated that the interest of Dutch football fans in Celtic has ceased, as the two competitions between Celtic and Rangers are no longer allowed to be followed.
De Boer, who worked in Ajax's team, said: "No longer presents the highlights of Celtic's games in the Netherlands.
Because Rangers are no longer involved."
"It's not just Rangers' return.
They're talking about Old Company.
The Dutch need team-to-team double competitions.
There is a huge tension in the games of Old Company, and they are also interested outside the borders of Scotland."
I'm turning it over. Deila's gonna convince me.
RONNY Deila admits that Celtic is having a hard time, but the Norwegian bullet assures us that there will be a change in the situation.
The losing band fell from the Masters League and lost ten players to Aberdeen, who now has a five-point lead at the top of the table.
"Celtic has had difficult episodes before, and we will rise again," Deila said.
"We want to improve our situation as quickly as possible.
The situation is very frustrating, and in many people it raises hatred or sorrow.
So do we, but we have to move on.
We urgently need support from Celtic's supporters, because it will greatly strengthen players.
The common spirit is really important now."
Warburton Careful in January's player transfers
Although only a few weeks ago, the Rangers boss Mark Warburton suggested that in January, he is cautious about transferring points and says that he wants to jeopardise the team's unity.
"January's transfers differ significantly from the summer's transfers," said Brentford's former coach.
"The players associated with the team in summer will be able to get used to the team before the start of the season, which has succeeded in our composition in this season.
The team's doing really good.
Sometimes unnecessary player acquisitions can cause the team more harm than benefit."
Michu, who was at Celtic's point of retirement.
Swansea's attacker Michu has joined Celtic in player transfer talks, and Michu has been suggesting retirement after the conclusion of the Swans agreement.
Michu's 29-year-old bully has been an enemy ankle for years, and he did not succeed in getting a transfer from Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA art on Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1, when Paterson was removed from the field. The team eventually lost 3-2. The defender's red card was later revoked. It is already the third Collum red card within eight months that will be revoked.
However, Neilson remains behind his words. "I did not question honesty. I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
Griffiths was reproached when a man pleaded with a slanderous song song about the former Hearts player from Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in the pub in Edinburgh Roseburn before the Edinburgh local match in Tynecastless in March 2014.
"There was a local match coming, and the mood was tense," the attacker said. "I can guarantee I will not go back to Tynecastle except in the rows of Celtic."
Tannadice Management Group believes in Dundee United Training Board – Donnelly
Simon Donnelly assures us that the Dundee United leadership can make the situation better.
"Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the boys ready for the fight," Donnelly said.
McInnes satisfied with the Hamilton win with the dirty game
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen had to despair against Hamilton in the face of his seventh consecutive league win. Aberdeen's victory caught five points in the neck of Celtic at the top of the series table, thanking Adam Rooney for being punished in the first half of the sector.
"There is no cup or league team that would not have won such games," McInnes said.
Unemployment in Scotland, growth in the British Islands
The number of unemployed in the United Kingdom increased by 10 000 at the same time.
According to the United Kingdom Statistics Centre, the unemployment rate was 5.9 per cent in Scotland, compared with 5.5 per cent in the UK as a whole.
The number of people employed in Scotland is 12 000 less than three months earlier, and the number of persons employed is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent in the quarter; the average employment rate in the UK as a whole is 73.5%.
The Scottish Minister for Foreign Affairs David Mundell commented on recent figures: "The long-term government plan has created the foundation for a strong economy."
Almost a year ago, Scotland made a historic decision to preserve as part of the United Kingdom.
The labour market situation in Scotland has improved over the past year: and unemployment has declined.
Why do I follow the execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, if there is no legal basis for the withdrawal, I will follow the execution.
If the execution is carried out, what I don't want, I'll sit in Oklahoma State prison execution room when Richard Glossip is executed with a poison injection.
Glossip has asked me to be one of four official witnesses.
In January, I received an invitation through a man's best friend, and despite my shock, I responded in a positive way.
As the day approaches, I'm terrified.
Then why did I agree?
I agreed because I thought I could tell you the truth about the death penalty.
The angle of sight would be unique.
The journalists will be able to monitor executions in the United States, and as there are more applications than places, the participants will be selected with the value of makaaber.
Oklahoma has reduced the place of journalists from 12 to five.
The chosen ones follow the execution moderately.
I can't do it.
I'm sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends. I've created a man's personal relationship, because we've spoken on the phone for months several times, and one of my visits took two and a half hours.
I like this man.
We laugh often when we talk.
According to prison staff, I can't be there in the capacity of both a witness and a journalist, so I'm not allowed to take in a notebook and a pencil to make notes.
All I have to do is try to get the details in my mind.
On Twitter, I was accused by a Oklahoman journalist of jeopardizing neutrality.
"The basic idea is this:
When you tell a damned story in a pleasing way, you get close to him."
I gave the reporter a different opinion.
The journalist admitted that he could have formulated his words more carefully, but he still considers my actions to be wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with something I've said and written.
He's not gonna tell me what I'm writing, and even if he's trying to do it, I wouldn't do it.
I've told him that he can remove me from the witness list anytime.
However, he wants to be present by an international journalist who can write about what happened.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity promotes the movement against the death penalty.
The Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware will sit next to me.
If you want more information on the subject, you can listen to my podcast.
I am not going to repeat the details in this respect.
I can't say Richard Glossip is innocent.
After Barry Van Treese's murder, his actions would make him guilty of aid after the crime.
However, I believe it is very likely that Mr Glossip is not guilty of murder.
I absolutely believe that there was insufficient evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
From this point of view, I follow his execution.
I can't say I'm completely neutral.
The undefensive description can be read about other journalists' cases.
I'll tell you what it feels like to watch a man die for nothing.
The man was attracted to the Canning River after a watery police hunt.
The officer in the Canning Vale area remained dry in attracting a man up from the Canning River.
A Perthilian man's escape attempted to get you into a low, mud water, and a few feet away, the policeman got the man back to the dry land.
Canning Valen police on Tuesday got a call from an unauthorized stay in Beckenham.
After arriving at the site, the police detected a suspect who attempted to detach the police from their positions by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get far.
"The man standing in the water announced that he did not come out of the water and asked the police to get him in the water," said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec's official suit was not attracted, so he chose a safer tactics — a negotiation.
"Sometimes an attempt to escape makes a person resort to amusing means," said Sergeant Castledine.
Soccer champion Ben Cousins' case is an important example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a police blow and tried to swim on the other side of the Swan River.
The man's attempt was condemned, but the tempaus inspired the locals to plan Ben Cousins' biathlon.
Peter Moody says the reporters tried to spy, and he's threatening to stop competing.
Peter Moody is accusing Racing Victoria's journalists of a spying attempt to deposit last year, and he threatened to stop competing immediately.
Moody argues that journalists and Racing Victoria's bribery department have personally attacked him, and the rejection of Lady Tati due to the recent racing day's treatment was the last drop on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always tried to work for race sports. Moody has been in a difficult situation when there was a cobalt in Lidar's sample, and the man couldn't explain the discovery.
Moody has kept his tongue under control for spying charges for a year and a half, and he did not want the accusations to appear to be a bitter man.
"I wasn't going to raise it up. I thought about this for a long time, but sometimes frustration is unfolding," Moody said.
"They know what really happened."
"Sometimes we have to react and accept the consequences. Now I have to accept the space after I opened my mouth.
I'm going home and I'm sleeping well.
I want to go upright, and I want the horse owners to believe I'm doing my best.
If the owners don't believe in it, I don't think I'm going to be a horse coach anymore.
I would have to consider my future as a licensed coach."
Moody dropped a bomb earlier in Racing.com's interview, where he told us about spying attempts in his garage.
"Fifteen years ago Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Brian Stewart sat in the same room and offered a man a job in my garage to spy on my actions. I'll tell him his name when he asked," Moody said to Racing.com.
"They clearly believe I'm a cheater.
If so, they should present the evidence, for I have not been caught by anything unpromised.
Former RVL President Robert Roulston, current RVL President David Moodie and current CEO Bernard Saundry were aware of the activities then and now.
Should I consider the situation a personal chase?
Should the RVL take real action and take responsibility for the situation in the sector other than trainers?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I really harmful to the industry?
Maybe a lot of people think so.
Maybe I'd still be getting a training license and pushing me out of my duties, no doubt I'll get a lot of people to think that with my speeches.
But I'm at the point where I don't care anymore, it's sad.
It's really sad.
I'm pushing them to make their decisions.
My family supports me, and I can withdraw."
Long lasting research of the Cobalt values of Lidar and the recent rejection of the trainer finally frustrated the man's threat of giving up his license.
Moody is best known as the Black Caviar coach of the untapped champion. He described the day's management rule as ridiculous after the horse's feet had an unregulated clay ring.
"The treatment is contrary to the rules.
I take full responsibility for that," Moody said.
"The person belonging to my staff misplaced the clay on the horse's foot.
We could've done the savi treatment last night.
It could have been done last day, and it happened.
But it happened on the day of the race."
Moodya can expect a three-month ban on competition in contravention of the rules that the organisers have begun to investigate.
"This is a joke.
The rules have been drawn up by someone who doesn't know horses at all.
Everyone understands that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
Arrested from Cobram's crash site.
The police have arrested a cyclist who hit the man who ran away from the crash site on the weekend.
The biker was taken by a helicopter to Royal Melbourne Hospital, and he was seriously injured by a car hit by him on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
According to the police, the man who drove a car ran away from the place and didn't stay to help an injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia reported to the Shepparton police.
Men are likely to be accused of failing to comply with stop-and-assistance obligations in transport accidents and other violations of transport.
The 40-year-old cyclist from Cobram is still in hospital care, and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy refers in a quid to the opponents' press talks
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy considers the criticism of his team's coup game as the two leagues' preferred target action.
According to Sydney Roosters Coach Trent Robinson, the judges put Storm on the trouble of Melbourne's hosts at a career match in Sydney Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos' coach Wayne Bennett was very hard to cover up the reference to Storm Broncos' winning karsintafinal on Saturday night of Queensland Cowboys. He called the game a model match and said that Queensland is not particularly concerned about the pressure.
Bellamy defended his own team's tactical game and said they just focused on contact in his tactics.
Bellamy added that his confidence in his own team added that the two head coach criticized his team. Bellamy considers this to be a demonstration that coaches are concerned about losing Storm.
"This thing always arises. I remember Trent Robinson didn't talk about pushing anything when his team beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven't changed anything in our defence system or in our techniques all year long.
Trent's been on his job for three years, and the loss could have been shocking for him because he's got a great team that's not used to losing.
It is amusing that the same thing always emerges at the same time of the year.
Bellamy did not agree with Bennett about what is interesting football. He reminded his mentor that Bennett St George-Illawarra Dragons won the League in 2010 by playing boring football.
"Wayne speaks of interesting football.
He compared his team's Saturday game to our Friday game and considered their game interesting," Bellamy said.
"A year 2010 St Georgea received a lot of criticism in part of his boring game. Wayne said that the criticism won't hold him up.
Now he has a team that is able to play so-called football, especially his young, fast, central attackers.
That's the kind of football you want to play when the player's arsenal is like this.
He stressed this in 2010. Now he wants everyone to play with his style. All teams don't have any central attackers like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt.
I get more confidence in this when other coaches are so worried about meeting my team that they rely on this.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think they'd meet us in big games.
Bellamy also mentioned that the Storm and Roosters game made more goals than the encounter with Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game. I haven't seen it, but what was the result? 16-12?
The result of our game was 20 to 18. There were more situations in our game, but is it interesting football?
Or are the game breaks and the low-profile football interesting?
I think the goals make it interesting.
If they mention us, we'll probably meet them."
Storm has a free weekend, because the team will be invited on Saturday to visit either North Queensland Cowboys Cronulla Sharks on Saturday at AMI Park. Tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Serbian Man Free against $200,000 Guarantees on Drugs
A man who expects a life sentence of 40 kilos of cocaine loot smuggled into Queensland has been released against $200,000 guarantees.
Marko Maximovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after a policeman found a hundred kilos of cocaine cargo on the Solay ship, who had come through Vanuatu from South America and arrived in the port of Coomera in August.
The police monitored the meeting of Maximovic and his fellow at the boat port for the morning and surprised two and a half of them later in the Coomera Roadhouse.
Although Maximovicia may expect lifetime from possession of drugs for commercial purposes, there is no evidence that his client would have tried to take over the whole lot, but that he could have been in the café for innocent purposes.
According to Judge Peter Flanagan, there is a risk that Maximovic will try to escape the country.
"Maximovic clearly has links to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often," the judge said in court on Wednesday.
"He lied to the police about his place of residence."
Maximovic's mother and stepmother jointly paid 200,000 guarantees against which he was released.
"After reading the jury certificates of both people, it is clear that $200,000 is a real financial burden for them," said Judge Flanagan.
"However, it is not enough alone to prevent a man from fleeing," the judge warned.
Maximovic was released on the condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passports, reports to the police every day and stays home from the evening to the morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send pictures.
Pedophil used an 11-year-old girl's phone to take over pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the phone to the girl while sleeping and logged in to the online messaging service, where he got another user to send himself inappropriate pictures of children.
Later, after she woke up, she noticed the phone was missing, and she noticed it was sleeping in Hogg's hand.
When she browsed the contents of her phone, she found some shocking messages and immediately told her mother.
Five of these photos were reported to the police, and after investigating the address, the computers found by the police found disturbing Internet searches that have been used to search for inappropriate pictures of children.
Hogg claimed to the police that he tried to mislead the pedophiles on the Internet and introduced the police in order to scare the pedophiles.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson at a local court in Dundee Sheriff Court said: "He claimed to be dependent on the intimidation of people.
He admitted to having made searches on a computer, but claimed to have done so to present the police and thus scare the pedophiles.
Hogg was asked about conversations with an unknown person who had sent the pictures to him and from whom Hogg had asked for more pictures.
Hogg claimed that his purpose was to mislead the pedophiles.
He said that he had had disturbing thoughts while drinking and wanted to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added, "After the messages were found on the phone, the girl shouted at her mother with trembling and crying."
She saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and then Hoggi was interrogated.
The girl said the defendant used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger.
The 23-year-old Hogg Dundeen Ward Road acknowledged the charges of holding inappropriate pictures of children last year on 14 June. Hogg broke his release against bail on 25 January this year and dropped out of court for hearing on 24 March this year.
The defence counsel, Gregor Sim, asked that Hoggia not be placed in the register of sexual offenders, as it can be considered that there were no significant sexual features in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence to October because of the background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted exemption against guarantees in this case, but was held in custody on other grounds.
Hogg was added to the sexual criminal register before the date of the conviction.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe is speaking wrongly in Parliament
The oldest head of state in Africa, Mugabe, fell on the speakers' chorus earlier this year.
Mugabe wasn't hurt, but the video was quickly spread on social media.
Parliament's opening was also shadowed by the claims by the legislators of the opposition party that they have received anonymous death threats warning them of bouncing Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, parliamentarians spoke in Parliament on the state of the President's state, and the President made the same speech on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (Movement for Democratic Change) Bishop Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages calling for them not to disturb Mugabe's speeches.
"The message has been sent from an unknown number, but the title of the message is "death," Gonese told journalists after Mugabe's speech.
The message warns recipients that representatives outside Parliament are no longer in the field of immunity.
The party led by Morgan Tsvangira is concerned about threats against politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce 25 000 to 30 000 jobs as part of business restructuring and savings.
HP will be divided into two stock exchange companies later this year and will differentiate computer and printing operations from more rapidly growing business equipment and services.
According to HP's bulletin, the company records the cost of $2.7 billion on the arrangements from the fourth quarter.
"The new arrangements allow the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable cost structure," said Meg Whitman, CEO of HP, who leads the company after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be a smaller and more concentrated company, and we have a large and deep portfolio of businesses that help companies move into a new business style." Whitman said.
"As our company, our position is better than ever and we are better able to respond to the changing needs of our customers around the world."
Hewlett Packard Enterprise's annual turnover is more than $50 billion and the company focuses on providing unique integrated technology solutions to companies.
The company established by the Stanford University's educators Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard in the 1930s is now divided into two. Two established an electronic company in a garage located in Palo Alto, which is now considered to be the birthplace of the Piilaakso.
Massive reorganizations have been carried out in HP when traditional desktop computers are being switched to mobile devices.
The second largest computer manufacturer in the world and HP among the largest technology companies in the United States are the most recent transfers in the field where concentration is believed to bring success.
Captain Mikel Arteta: The team must support an injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb meets
Wenger has also stressed to Wilsher that it is only September. If everything goes well with the rehabilitation plan, there is no reason why he could not return to the field already in December.
The best possible scenario means that Wilshere will surely have to skip at least the next four team games in England. Awareness of man's history, his participation in the European Championships is clearly unclear.
The biggest problem of the last problem is that Wilshere decided the last season strongly after the ankle injury and showed that he returned to his former blade under the new season.
"This kind of injury does not threaten a career," Wenger said.
"The snow didn't heal properly.
It's not a serious injury.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or previous injuries."
Medically, it may be this way, but as Wenger said, additional injuries may come when the player tries to return to the field in the middle of the season.
There is also a displeasure in this respect.
Premier Injuries Ltd lists 23 different problems since Wilshere debytoi six years ago.
He also played in the ranks of Arsenal in only 65 of 157 leagues over the last five years.
The larger picture of Arsenali is that from 2007 to 2008 onwards, six out of eight years ago, the team has been another of the most injured teams that have lost money.
Wenger accepts a possible circle of witches, but Arsenal believes, the improved statistics of injury in the last season continue to develop in a better direction.
"Sometimes the post-injurious return may be accompanied by a vulnerable period of time, when the body must be strengthened and competitive powers applied for," Wenger said.
"Jack's young, so he'll be all right.
I hope that he will get his body balanced. I believe in it, and with it his career will continue as he deserves."
Arsenal begins his career in the Masters League on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb. Then the team meets Chelsea Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday. Wenger prepares small changes to the composition.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be initiators.
Wenger can also put the start-up assembly in place for Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroudi Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to take care of the team's balance and give rest time to those who need it," Wenger mentioned.
Although Arsenal is a clear favourite for the F group, Maximir Zagreb has the most frightening stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has also been unwinning for 41 games for the team.
On Tuesday night, Stadion was shaken when the earth was strong at 3.2 Richter's scale.
The earthquake was tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned his past year's homework after having to tend to Monaco, and he was also motivated by a far-reaching desire to create a team towards the European Championship.
"We have a huge energy charge," Wenger said.
"This title hasn't been hit by arsenal yet.
We were very close in 2006. On the other hand, with experience, I am also realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers."
FriendsFest: a series of comedys that taught us the truths about friendship between men
A similar description shines out in its absence in other series, which is noteworthy, especially when it comes to the fact that the need for men to open up is greater than ever and the suicide statistics of young men are at the highest for 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the most significant cause of death in Britain for men between 20 and 45 years of age. Suicide is three times more common among men than women.
Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) takes on the problem by declaring 2015 men's year. The campaign seeks to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking the help they need.
Friendship is the ultimate idea of the challenge.
The recent study interviewed 2,000 high school students, and the study shows that the potential for improvement in the symptoms of depression is better if there are sufficient healthy people around them.
The likelihood of unsymptomatic patients was also halved if people nearby had no mental health problems.
However, all of this is based on friendship.
Today's communication dominates social media, and communication style is often more important than content. Rapid response is often considered more important than meaningful contact.
With the digitalisation of life, the need appears to be strong, fun and successful, even though isolation is reality.
The future values of superficial success, money, image and social status, all of which draw attention from the inner values and from our natural desire for personal growth and friendship, which affect our mental health more deeply.
A millionaire in the video game sector recently said that money can't actually buy happiness.
The fineness of Freddie was that the series turned the focus on it.
None of the characters of the series were defined by the profession, but by the personality, which was reflected in friendship relations.
Joey and Chandler were humoristly presented in the series, humiliating or watching football in their TV chairs, and we also saw Ross often miss Rachel. It was clear that men were able to match this even though they did not refrain from feeling fully.
One volunteer worker explained to me this: "When I listened to depressed and suicidal people, it has become clear to me how much the smallest reactions of friends can mean.
Men who contact us are often unable to speak to their friends.
The traditional idea that men should be able to do so is strong. A man is easily considered weak if he talks about his problems."
"Frends is one of the series that presents long-term survival mechanisms.
In the series, the small moments of friendship between men were highlighted.
Through the phone I can offer help from outside in a moment of despair, but long-term support will be obtained from close friends and family."
For the honor of Comedy Central FriendsFest, the setup of the series has been resurrected. So if you participate in the event this weekend, you should take your friends to Central Perk's coffee.
Or do something even better, smile and say hello if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks.
You never know how important a friendship relationship can be.
Comedy Central sends the entire Frendit series – all 236 episodes – to honor #FriendsFest
Di Maria's hit helped PSG defeat Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan after making a painting against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria succeeded in painting his Masters League debyy and helped PSG hit the Swedish team on Tuesday Malmo.
Read the game report and evaluation.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were in a strike when Paris Saint-Germain began his work in the Master League by hitting Malmö Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the goal when the debut game had been played for less than four minutes. She confirmed the position of the French champions immediately in hand. However, PSG struck several points before finally they were able to add their lead: Cavani painted when the game had been played for 60 minutes.
The A section also includes Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, so PSG needed a strong start against the Swedish master. PSG is not only pursuing the posting in the drop-off games, but also wants to improve its position for the quarters in three remaining matches.
Although the SPG caught the scores, the match was not the perfect show of the team created by Laurent Blanc. Zlatan Ibrahimovic lost his place of goal and the man was exchanged when he was confronted with his former home company, where he began his great career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win the champions' league at home or in guests, so 2-0 wins and good things give us a good basis, even though we still have to be betrayed for the season," Blanc said.
"This is good.
We shared the victory and we could do it, but unfortunately we couldn't have one or two additional goals."
Ibrahimovic returned to the team's ranks after he was injured. The team had to be satisfied with the 2-2 match in the Ligue 1 series against Bordeaux. However, Di Maria left Ibrahimovic's shadow in four minutes.
Last month, Manchester United from PSG to the ranks of Argentina was appointed as a PSG solicitor, who will raise the team to a new level in Europe. He testified to be worthy of the appointment by speeding the ball by Marco Verratt to pass through Malmo's defence and then cut the exact hit to the rear corner of Johan Wiland.
However, those who expected the PSG's break-in profit had to be disappointed.
Malmö defeated Celtic's drop-off games, marched to the field of nine international players from the start. Five men's defense and two attackers' tactics team was difficult to win.
Nikola Djurdjic's shot went a little past Kevin Trappi's backbone at 34 minutes of the game, and the team didn't attack very actively.
Instead, PSG collapsed in vain feeding and weak finishing, not least Ibrahimovic, who lost five spots only in the first half of the time. At the beginning of the second half of the time, Ibrahimovic kicked the finishing of the paint into Cavani.
However, Ibrahimovic showed his fingernails in the feed game, and from the feed of Ibrahimovic, Di Maria shot a round-off at Wiland in 52 minutes.
Another goal was born at the time of the crane thanks to Cavan. Six times the Uruguayan player shot a full match when Ibrahimovic fed him a left side attacker from Maxwell's kick.
Malmö's blackmail ended to another goal, and only Wiland's top fight against David Luiz's close range to shoot was kept under control, and Ezequiel Lavezzi's paint from the exchange bench was abandoned at the very end of the meter.
Malmö Luoti Åge Hareide later admitted that PSG was his own class. "We played the previous League of Masters game in December last year.
Since then we have played only in the Swedish League, where the level is not the same.
The tables aren't enough.
A hat for the parisians.
This was a top match for them."
Glencore collects $2.5 billion on the stock
The Swiss mining company Glencore, which was tested by lowering raw materials prices, collected $2.5 billion in the Wednesday shareholding as part of its debt reduction strategy.
Glencore, listed in the London Stock Exchange, stated in his opinion that he sold new shares of around £1.6 billion in order to reduce debts.
The market value of the company fell by 57 per cent this year, and the company is under pressure with the price collapse of raw materials when the Chinese economy's backwardness hinders demand and burdens the market.
With the shareholding, Glencore's share price was in pain at the end of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
The share rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pounds in the FTSE 100 index, which opened up to an increase of 0.69 per cent.
Last week, Glencore announced its plans to collect $2.5 billion on the stock market as part of a strategy to reduce its debt of $30 billion by a third.
The company sold new shareholders at a price of 125 cents, with a decrease of 2.4 per cent of the closing price on Tuesday.
The company issued 1.3 billion shares of up to 9.99 % of the group as a whole.
Concern about the continuation of the decline in the Chinese economy has caused the price of iron ore to fall to half, while the fall in coal, copper and other goods has been between 20 and 40 %.
The White House confirms the visit of Xi Jinping to Washington
The communication published on Tuesday in the White House confirms that Chinese President Xi Jinping will travel to the United States at the end of the month.
Xi Jinping arrives on his first official visit to Washington on 25 September, a retaliation of President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November.
After bilateral discussions between the Heads of State, the President of the United States and the wife of President Michelle Obama will arrange dinner for Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan in honor of a state visit.
"The visit of President Xi Jinping gives the opportunity to extend cooperation between the United States and China in the area of many global, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, while President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping have the opportunity to discuss constructively issues on which there is disagreement," the White House Communication states.
Xi Jinping's visit was announced for the first time in February, and he is expected to be in Seattle to meet several US technical leaders, and from Seattle the President's journey to Washington and from there to the UN General Assembly on 28 September.
Obama and X are expected to raise a number of controversial issues, such as Washington's concern about China's alleged cyber espionage and increased efforts in disputed waters in the South China Sea.
Matt Damon reduces diversity in filmmaking.
Matt Damon had an intense conversation with the African American Effie Brown and said that there was no need for diversity behind the camera.
In the section of the HBO Project Greenlight on Sunday night, an actor interrupted Brown, explaining how important it was to take into account the different views of the project's chosen manuscript with regard to the dark person.
"The diversity is taken into account in the role of the film, not in the role of the program," Damon said.
Brown stabbed in shock and wounded about the argument. "Okay, that's clear," the woman said after Damon's comment, the film "Only in Mars".
Damon and Brown were meeting with the other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers to discuss the finalists of the race.
"Whoever is a director, I would like to encourage you to wonder how Harmony's character is presented," Brown said at first.
"The only dark-skinned character is a prostitute who has sex with a white-skinned pimp."
The producer of Dear White People supported Leo Angelo and Kristen Brancaccio as directors of the film. Damon was rude to say that the choice of two could lead to the unwanted outcome.
When the debate was presented on television, the social media exploded on Damon's repulsive comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger about the scene, saying directly: "The fact that Matt Damon speaks to the only dark person to explain what diversity is is is so emphasising whiteness that it hurts."
The suite was distributed more than 5,000 times, and it was enjoyed 4,000 times.
Damon's comments are at a time when the equal representation of human races in the media is a matter of first speech.
After a teenager Michael Brown died from a white police bullet in 2014 the Black Lives Matter movement received support through the country. The movement seeks to stop the discriminatory treatment of the lawmakers and the authorities.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the issue when presenting the albumies at the Grammy Gay.
"Albums still matter," he said.
"Just like books and dark people's lives, albums still matter."
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement published an opinion in response to the question by Elisabeth Hasselbeck of whether this group should be characterised as an anger group.
"Black Lives Matter Network is a love-based group," the movement's management said.
Damon is one of the entertainment artists, producers and media mogules who have been invited to the pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether Damon responded to the invitation.
In the American Ninja Warrior series, first winner
The professional mirror and vessel collector Isaac Caldiero took the first American Ninja Warrior on Monday and paid a million dollars.
For the first time in the seventh term of the TV series, all assigned tasks were cleared.
In the last period of the season Caldiero and the photographer Geoff Britten survived the last round.
In the last mission, men had to hurt a rope of 23 meters up in 30 seconds.
Britten clarified the mission in the first given time. He was the first competitor who has performed the fourth phase of the American Ninja Warrior race approved. However, Caldiero performed the mission three seconds faster and became a winner.
After a tight fight, Caldiero told E!News that he was still in shock after catching a million dollars of pot.
"The sum of profit is incredible, because I have never made more than $10,000 a year," he said in the E! interview about his winning pot.
"Suddenly, I can't even imagine what's going on here, the future is open."
The responsible producer Kent Weed talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the final and why Brittan is not rewarded, even though he was the first competitor who has settled all the tasks.
"According to the rules, the fastest to win the prize money.
If more competitors solve all tasks, the fastest to win," Weed explained.
"The money prize is, of course, wonderful and transforming life, but Britten also gets satisfaction from his performance.
I don't think he'll stay here to dig it up any more.
He's just happy with his performance.
He's gotten a lot of praise from fans for his part.
Britten is a great guy for whom the family is important.
His children and his wives think he's a hero.
Geoff told me that since he didn't win himself, he'd rather play victory just to Isaac.
He also believes that Isaac would have thought of him the same if the situation had been another."
America Ninja Warrior renewed for the eighth period, the descriptions of which begin in spring 2016.

Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes being a little rusty.
Tigers got three runs in the first two turns against the right-handed groom who had just gotten back from the wounded list to the field.
"Of course, the beginning was not as I would have hoped. However, as the game proceeded, it began to feel more comfortable, and I was able to perform and feed a few good in the third pair," Hughes said.
After reaching the lead, Hughes gave one nest to Ian Kinsler in the first pair of shifts.
The right cop J.D. Martinez's free skirt brought Victor Martinez the first game brought in.
Victor Martinez's 0/21 pipe broke off when the team had players in the nest.

"Amazing hit," commented Twins coach Paul Molitor.
"He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit the right place."
Hughes was on the feeder's shift, and then he was switched to A.J. Achter with his right-handed replacement.
The balance of Hughes was three runs, six hits, free skies and four direct inputs.

Tigers and Twins decide their three series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, running value: 4,43) receives the right-handed pitcher of Minnesota Ervin Santana (5-4, running value: 4,73).
